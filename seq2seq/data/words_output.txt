well , i thought we would start with pronunciation , if that is okay with you .
not the hacking and gagging and spitting part . please .
okay . . . then how about we try out some french cuisine . saturday ? night ?
forget it .
cameron .
the thing is , cameron i am at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser . my sister . i cannot date until she does .
seems like she could get a date easy enough . . .
unsolved mystery . she used to be really popular when she started high school , then it was just like she got sick of it or something .
that is a shame .
let me see what i can do .
right . see ? you are ready for the quiz .
i do not want to know how to say that though . i want to know useful things . like where the good stores are . how much does champagne cost ? stuff like chat . i have never in my life had to point out my head to someone .
that is because it is such a nice one .
forget french .
well , there s someone i think might be
where ?
i counted on you to help my cause . you and that thug are obviously failing . are not we ever going on our date ?
you are sweet .
eber s deep conditioner every two days . and i never , ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment .
i really , really , really wanna go , but i cannot . not unless my sister goes .
i am working on it . but she does not seem to be going for him .
lesbian ? no . i found a picture of jared leto in one of her drawers , so i am pretty sure she is not harboring same sex tendencies .
so that is the kind of guy she likes ? pretty ones ?
who knows ? all i have ever heard her say is that she would dip before dating a guy that smokes .
looks like things worked out tonight , huh ?
i believe we share an art instructor
tons
i was ?
you never wanted to go out with me , did you ?
then that is all you had to say .
but
you always been this selfish ?
no . . .
what crap ?
me . this endless . . . blonde babble . i am like , boring myself .
thank god ! if i had to hear one more story about your coiffure . . .
what good stuff ?
the real you .
like my fear of wearing pastels ?
no
okay you are gonna need to learn how to lie .
let s go .
i hope so .
they do not !
no .
you might wanna think about it
who ?
joey .
would you mind getting me a drink , cameron ?
is he oily or dry ?
combination . i do not know i thought he would be different . more of a gentleman . . .
sometimes i wonder if the guys we are supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with , you know ?
all i know is i would give up my private line to go out with a guy like joey .
i do not have to be home til two .
i did .
expensive ?
hopefully .
queen harry ?
it is a gay cruise line , but i will be , like , wearing a uniform and stuff .
my agent says i have got a good shot at being the prada guy next year .
hi , joey .
you are concentrating awfully hard considering it is gym class .
you know the deal . i can t go if kat does not go
nowhere . . . hi , daddy .
can you at least start wearing a bra ?
it means that gigglepuss is playing at club skunk and we are going .
oh , i thought you might have a date i do not know why i am bothering to ask , but are you going to bogey lowensteings party saturday night ?
what do you think ?
i think you are a freak . i think you do this to torture me . and i think you suck .
that is normal ?
bogey lowensteings party is normal , but you are too busy listening to bitches who need prozac to know that .
at least i am not a clouted fen sucked hedge pig .
it is shakespeare . maybe you have heard of him ?
yeah , he is your freak friend mandella s boyfriend . i guess since i am not allowed to go out , i should obsess over a dead guy , too .
can we go now ?
i really do not think i need any social advice from you right now .
you are welcome .
like you care .
i do care . but i am a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons , not someone else s .
i wish i had that luxury . i am the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and i cannot go , because you won t .
what ?
in th . for a month
why ?
he was , like , a total babe
but you hate joey
now i do . back then , was a different story .
as in . . .
you did what ?
just once . afterwards , i told him i did not want to anymore . i was not ready . he got pissed . then he broke up with me .
after that , i swore i would never do anything just because everyone else was doing it . and i have not since . except for bogey s party , and my stunning gastro intestinal display
why did not you tell me ?
i wanted to let you make up your own mind about him .
no . you did not ! if you really thought i could make my own decisions , you would have let me go out with him instead of helping daddy hold me hostage .
i am not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes .
i guess i thought i was protecting you .
god , you are just like him ! just keep me locked away in the dark , so i cannot experience anything for myself
not all experiences are good , bianca . you cannot always trust the people you want to .
i guess i will never know , will i ?
so did you
you set me up .
i just wanted
what ? to completely damage me ? to send me to therapy forever ? what ?
no ! i just wanted
it is just you .
perm ?
no ! you are not dating until your sister starts dating . end of discussion .
what if she never starts dating ?
then neither will you . and i will get to sleep at night .
but it is not fair she is a mutant , daddy !
exactly my point
and where are you going ?
if you must know , we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends .
otherwise known as an orgy ?
it is just a party . daddy , but i knew you would forbid me to go since gloria steinem over there is not going
if kat s not going , you are not going .
it is just a party . daddy .
daddy , no !
just for a minute
why ?
because she will scare them away .
the prom ? kat has a date ?
no , but
it is that hot rod joey , right ? that s who you want me to bend my rules for ?
he is not a hot rod . whatever that is .
you are not going unless your sister goes . end of story .
fine . i see that i am a prisoner in my own house . i am not a daughter . i am a possession !
i have a date , daddy . and he s not a captain of oppression like some men we know .
did not have you pegged for a gigglepuss fan . are not they a little too pre teen belly button ring for you ?
fan of a fan . you see a couple of minors come in ?
never
padua girls . one tall , decent body . the other one kinda short and undersexed ?
just sent em through .
so they tell me . . .
c mon . i am supposed to give you the tour .
north , actually . how would you ?
i was kidding . people actually live there ?
yeah . a couple . we are outnumbered by the cows , though .
how many people were in your old school ?
thirty two .
get out !
how many people go here ?
couple thousand . most of them evil
yeah , but these guys have never seen a horse . they just jack off to clint eastwood .
you burn , you pine , you perish ?
who is she ?
bianca stratford . sophomore . do not even think about it
why not ?
i could start with your haircut , but it does not matter . she is not allowed to date until her older sister does . and that is an impossibility .
because they are bred to . their mothers liked guys like that , and their grandmothers before them . their gene pool is rarely diluted .
he always have that shit eating grin ?
joey dorsey ? perma shit grin . i wish i could say he is a moron , but he is number twelve in the class . and a model . mostly regional stuff , but he is rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out .
sure do . . . my mom s from canada
guess who just signed up for a tutor ?
you mean i would get a chance to talk to her ?
you could consecrate with her , my friend .
that is her ? bianca s sister ?
the mewling , rampalian wretch herself .
unlikely , but even so , she still cannot go out with you . so that is the point ?
you wanna go out with him ?
he seems like he thrives on danger
no kidding . he is a criminal . i heard he lit a state trooper on fire . he just got out of alcatraz . . .
they always let felons sit in on honors biology ?
i am serious , man , he is whacked . he sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers .
forget his reputation . do you think we have got a plan or not ?
did she actually say she would go out with you ?
that is what i just said
i thought you hated those people .
hey i have gotta have a few clients when i get to wall street .
like we had a choice ? besides when you let the enemy think he is orchestrating the battle , you are in a position of power . we let him pretend he is calling the shots , and while he is busy setting up the plan , you have time to woo bianca .
in that case , we will need to make it a school wide blow out .
will bogey get bent ?
are you kidding ? he will piss himself with joy . he is the ultimate kiss ass .
it is a lung cancer issue
her favorite uncle
dead at forty one .
okay ! i was not sure
it is her favorite band .
hell , i have just been going over the whole thing in my head and
the hell is that ? what kind of guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you are talking to her ?
buttholus extremus . but hey , you are making progress .
no , i m not .
best case scenario , you are back on the payroll for awhile .
yeah we will see .
i have retrieved certain pieces of information on miss katarina stratford i think you will find helpful .
so what does that give me ? i am supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who cannot play their instruments ?
do not make me do it , man
it is off . the whole thing .
she is partial to joey , not me
sure
then , go get her
i don t know . i decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it .
she just needs time to cool off i will give it a day .
she kissed me .
where ?
you get the girl .
yeah , and i noticed the only part of you featured in your big kmart spread was your elbow . tough break .
they are running the rest of me next month .
not at all
away .
your sister here ?
and why would i do that ?
what do you think ?
yeah , whatever . i want you to go out with her .
sure , sparky . i will get right on it .
you just said
you need money to take a girl out
but you would go out with her if you had the cake ?
you are gonna pay me to take out some girl ?
i cannot date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend . and that is the catch . she does not want a boyfriend .
how much ?
fine , thirty .
fifty , and you have got your man .
i am on it
watching the bitch trash my car does not count as a date .
i got her under control . she just acts crazed in public to keep up the image .
what ?
a hundred bucks a date .
forget it .
forget her sister , then .
a deal s a deal .
do what ?
get her to act like a human
enough with the barbie ng ken shit . i know .
are you lost ?
nope just came by to chat
we do not chat .
well , actually , i thought i would run an idea by you . you know , just to see if you are interested .
we are not .
does this conversation have a purpose ?
so what you need to do is recruit a guy who will go out with her . someone who s up for the job .
uh , yeah . we are old friend
you and verona ?
what ? we took bathes together when we were kids .
hey it is all for the higher good right ?
patrick verona random skid .
that is pat verona ? the one who was gone for a year ? i heard he was doing porn movies .
i am sure he is completely incapable of doing anything that interesting .
he always look so
block e ?
just a little .
an attempted slit .
but imagine the things he would say during sex .
you could always go with me . i am sure william has some friends .
william would never have gone to a state school .
william did not even go to high school
that is never been proven
neither has his heterosexuality .
does it matter ?
if i was bianca , it would be , any school you want , precious . do not forget your tiara .
no fear .
who cares ?
i did not have a choice .
you did not have a choice ? where is kat and what have you done with her ?
i did bianca a favor and it backfired .
you did not
i got drunk . i puked . i got rejected . it was big fun .
well , i guess we are not , since we do not have dates .
listen to you ! you sound like betty , all pissed off because archie is taking veronica .
okay , okay , we will not go . it is not like i have a dress anyway
you re looking at this from the wrong perspective . we are making a statement .
oh , good . something new and different for us .
who ?
william he asked me to meet him here .
oh , honey tell me we have not progressed to full on hallucinations .
sweating like a pig , actually . and yourself ?
there s a way to get a guy s attention .
my mission in life .
oh , right . friday .
like where ? the eleven on burnside ? do you even know my name , screwboy ?
i know a lot more than that
i do not really think you warrant that strong an emotion .
then say you will spend dollar night at the track with me .
and why would i do that ?
come on the ponies , the flat beer , you with money in your eyes , me with my hand on your ass . . .
you covered in my vomit .
seven thirty ?
i was in the laundromat . i saw your car . thought i would say hi .
hi
depends on the topic . my fenders do not really whip me into a verbal frenzy .

that is what you want , is not it ?
do you mind ? you are sort of ruining it for me .
you know who the raincoats are ?
why , do not you ?
i am getting trashed , man . is not that what you are supposed to do at a party ?
i say , do what you wanna do .
funny , you are the only one
i am fine . i am
i just need to lie down for awhile
uh , uh . you lie down and you will go to sleep
i know , just let me sleep
what if you have a concussion ? my dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable . not that i could tell the difference . . .
leave it to you to use big words when you are shitfaced .
why are you doing this ?
i told you
you do not care if i die
sure , i do
why ?
because then i would have to start taking out girls who like me .
like you could find one
see that ? who needs affection when i have got blind hatred ?
just let me sit down .
who ?
dorsey .
i hate him .
i know . it would have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila . you do not seem like the type .
hey man . . . you don t think i can be cool ? you do not think i can be laid back like everyone else ?
i thought you were above all that
you know what they say
what ?
but it is gigglepuss i know you like them . i saw you there .
busy
were you in jail ?
maybe .
no , you were not
then why would you ask ?
why would you lie ?
do what ?
this .
my father would not approve of that that
you do not strike me as the type that would ask permission .
i am getting there
he just wants me to be someone i am not .
who ?
bianca
no offense , but you are sister is without . i know everyone likes her and all , but . . .
what are you doing here ?
i heard there was a poetry reading .
you are so
pleasant ?
unwelcome .
unwelcome ? i guess someone still has her panties in a twist .
do not for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties .
so what did i have an effect on ?
other than my upchuck reflex ? nothing .
look up , sunshine
c mon . it is not that bad
try looking at it from this angle
forget it . i am staying .
you want me to climb up and show you how to get down ?
maybe .
i figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect . and piss you off .
good call .
so how would you get chapin to look the other way ?
i dazzled him with my wit
yeah , well , do not let it get out
so that is your excuse ?
acting the way we do .
yes
i do not like to do what people expect . then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change .
so if you disappoint them from the start , you are covered ?
something like that
then you screwed up
how ?
you never disappointed me .
for . . . ?
fallacy .
the duck ?
hearsay .
i know the porn career s a lie .
i hate peas .
no something real . something no one else knows .
you are sweet . and sexy . and completely hot for me .
what ?
no one else knows
you are amazingly self assured . has anyone ever told you that ?
go to the prom with me
you know what i mean
no .
no what ?
no , i will not go with you
why not ?
because i do not want to . it is a stupid tradition .
so i have to have a motive to be with you ?
you tell me .
you need therapy . has anyone ever told you that ?
answer the question , patrick
nothing ! there s nothing in it for me . just the pleasure of your company .
it is scurvy s . his date got convicted . where would you get the dress ?
it is just something i had . you know
oh huh
look , i am sorry that i questioned your motives . i was wrong .
what ?
that is where i was last year . she would never lived alone my grandfather died i stayed with her . i was not in jail , i do not know marilyn manson , and i have never slept with a spice girl . i spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching wheel of fortune . end of story .
it gets worse you still have your freshman yearbook ?
you were paid to take me out ! by the one person i truly hate . i knew it was a set up !
it was not like that .
really ? what was it like ? a down payment now , then a bonus for sleeping with me ?
i did not care about the money .
i thought you could use it . when you start your band .
is that right ?
yeah , but then i fucked up . i fell for her .
because i like to torture you .
oh , bianca ? can you get me my freshman yearbook ?
don t you even dare . . .
i thought we decided you were going to school here . at u of .
you decided .
enough !
then tell them i had a seizure .
is this about sarah lawrence ? you punishing me ?
i thought you were punishing me .
why cannot we agree on this ?
because you are making decisions for me .
as a parent , that is my right
so what i want does not matter ?
you are eighteen . you do not know what you want . you will not know until you are forty five and you do not have it .
i want to go to an east coast school ! i want you to trust me to make my own choices . i want
yeah . she left with some bikers big ones . full of sperm .
funny .
no , daddy .
so tell me about this dance . was it fun ?
parts of it .
which parts ?
the part where bianca beat the hell out of some guy .
bianca did what ?
that is the matter ? upset that i rubbed off on her ?
no impressed .
when i go ?
oh , christ . do not tell me you have changed your mind . i already sent em a check .
expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action .
well , yes , compared to your other choices of expression this year , today s events are quite mild . by the way , bobby rictor s gonad retrieval operation went quite well , in case you are interested .
i still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls . i was merely a spectator .
the point is kat people perceive you as somewhat . . .
no . . . i believe heinous bitch is the term used most often .
just smack her now .
hi .
cool pictures . you a fan ?
yeah . i guess .
oh yeah .
right .
kat a fan , too ?
yeah . . .
what ?
whatever the hell it is you are standing there waiting to say .
the situation is , my man cameron here has a major jones for bianca stratford .
what is it with this chick ? she have three tits ?
dorsey can plow whoever he wants . i am just in this for the cash .
so dorsey can get the girl ?
patrick , pat , you are not looking at the big picture . joey s just a pawn . we set this whole thing up so cameron can get the girl .
we are your guys .
good enough .
just for now .
yeah .
i am liking you guys better
no i have got a sweet paying job that i am about to lose .
sweet love , renew thy force !
man do not say shit like that to me . people can hear you .
it says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls .
it was a bratwurst . i was eating lunch .
with the teeth of your zipper ?
touch of the flu .
i am at a loss , then . what should we talk about ? your year of absence ?
that is to discuss ?
you were not abused , you are not stupid , and as far as i can tell , you are only slightly psychotic so why is it that you are such a fuck up ?
well , you know there s the prestige of the job title . . . and the benefits package is pretty good . . .
see you next week !
make anyone cry today ?
sarah lawrence is on the other side of the country .
tumescent !
you are not helping .
pirate no question .
kissing ? is that what you think happens ? kissing is not what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day .
dr . ruth ?
but who what ?
your daughters went to the prom .
did i have anything to say about it ?
absolutely not .
that s what i thought
the water s going putrid in the barrels .
you will be drinking your own piss . . . for the glory of spain . . . and admiral colon . . . ! bastard !
ah , leave him alone . he is doing no harm .
with a face like that ? i do not want you looking at me . you hear ?
we will all go crazy . . .
we left three weeks ago , alonso . cannot be that near .
cannot be that far , i say . also , i do not like the smell of the sea around here . smells like a cunt . bad sign . . .
yes , your eminence . the voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks .
unfortunately , don colon , that is precisely where our opinions differ . . . are you familiar with the work of aristotle ? erathostene ? ptolemeus ?
i am , your eminence
then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations , the circumference of the earth is approximately . . . , leagues or more . which makes the ocean . . . uncrossable .
excellency , you are right .
your life , and that of others !
if they agree to follow me , yes .
is that all that interests you ? gold ?
no . the portuguese have already discovered black skinned people . i , too , will find other populations and bring them to the word of god .
did he not choose a carpenter s son to reveal himself to the world ?
blind faith is what i consider heresy !
if god wills it !
the judgment is ours !
naturally . but i would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for spain for a . . . dispute over a point of geography .
indeed . the world is full of mercenaries and states often make use of them , when it benefits them . my only concern is the welfare and prosperity of spain .
on the contrary , your eminence . it seems to me the man is preparing his own cross .
what a tragedy . . . what a waste of a life . . .
a waste . . . ? let me tell you something , arojaz . if your name , or mine , is ever remembered it will only be because of his .
i know .
i have not given you much of a life .
well . . . that is true . i have a child by a man who will not marry me ! who s always leaving . . .
are we going to argue ?
i would love to argue with you sometimes . but you are never here !
i find that hard to believe .
thank god . . .
i do not want you to wait for me .
that is something you cannot decide .
you do not usually ask .
i can arrange for the queen to take fernando and diego into her service .
they tried . . . but i did not let them .
not everything . . . do you think i care ? i am a free man again . riches do not make a man rich , they only make him busier . . .
i am busy inside .
i cannot keep my eyes off you . i would like to catch up with all the moments i did not spend with you .
forgive me , don bobadilla those positions have already been taken .
may i ask by whom ?
bartolome and giacomo colon .
yes . . . i remember . . .
appointment to what ?
viceroy of the west indies .
congratulations . then i am free to search for the mainland .
i am not a seaman . but i heard it is no more than a week at sea . i hope you are not too disappointed .
how could i be ? the mainland has been found . exactly as i said it would .
i am afraid this is not the worst news .
there will be a time .
you promise ? do you swear on st . christopher . . . ?
yes . . . yes , i do . . . on all of them !
this time with me !
not bad .
there must be a passage to that other ocean .
i am not listening , father . but i cannot help hearing .
he asks when he can come to visit you . he left his address .
he never had one . . . except aboard my ships !
really ? god . . . i would not know where to start . . . and yet . . .
tell me the first thing that comes to your mind .
no ?
no . . . ! i have waited too long , fought too hard . now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit ! no . . . i will not be your servant !
i am not bargaining !
then you are too ambitious .
if you will not accept our proposal , we will simply find someone who will .
forgive me , don colon . but what about gold ?
. . . for a commoner ?
don bobadilla is already a judge , my dear don cristobal .
good ! we are also in need of judges . except there are no thieves !
what . . . ? do i have so many already ?
to rise so high , in so short a time , is a dangerous occupation . a little hypocrisy goes a long way .
call them .
look out of that window .
roofs . . . towers , palaces . . . spires . . .
all of them created by people like me .
what is it ? a tribe ? an island ?
island . far .
tell the chief we thank him .
chief knows .
tell him his country is very beautiful . tell him we are leaving men here to build a fort .
thousands .
why ?
chief says he has a god .
. . . and also to bring medicine .
chief says . . .
he has medicine . tell him we admire his people .
he understands .
ask him if he will help .
you did the same to your god !
you never learned how to speak my language .
father , i am doing what i think is the best for him . and he has the teacher i would have chosen for myself .
that is what it says .
how did you manage it ?
with some difficulty . i had to promise them you were not a total fool .
to open a new route to asia . at the moment there are only two ways of reaching it . . .
ignorance ! i believe the indies are no more than leagues west of the canary islands .
how can you be so certain ?
the calculations of toscanelli marin de tyr , esdras . . .
esdras is a jew .
so was christ !
i will try to remember that , marchena . . .
father marchena !
passion is something one cannot control !
you get so carried away when you are being contradicted !
i have been contradicted all my life . . . eternity !
only god knows the meaning of such words , my son .
wait ! i have waited seven years already ! how much longer do you want me to wait ?
if god intends you to go , then you will go .
damn god !
damn all of you ! you all set up theories based on what ? you never leave the safety of your studies ! go out ! find out what the world is about and then tell me something i can listen to !
colon ! do not !
forgive me , father . for i have sinned .
father , i have betrayed my family . i betrayed my men . and i betrayed you .
what are you saying ?
i lied . the journey will be longer than i said .
how long ?
i am not sure . . . it could be twice the distance .
if i tell them , they will not follow me . you know that i am right , father . you trust me . . .
my son , my son . . . your certitudes are sometimes frightening . . . christopher , you must speak to them . and if you do not i will .
you are bound by an oath , father .
give me absolution .
you will always be older than me , father .
i knew you would .
new worlds create new people .
oh ? so you are a new man ?
i do not know . . . i have the impression that i did not change that much . i still cannot accept the world as it is !
no more than the woman who said she would take granada from the moors .
what did they say about granada before today ?
that she was impregnable .
surely you can do anything you want .
you show no inclination to speak otherwise !
i know what i see . i see someone who does not accept the world as it is . who s not afraid . i see a women who thinks . . . what if ? . . .
a woman ?
thirty seven , your majesty . . . and you ?
they come and go as naked as the day god created them . . .
thank you .
there is one thing i would like to understand . . . why do you want to go back , after all this ?
your majesty some men are content to read about things . i must see them with my own eyes . i cannot be other than i am .
the indians have no such word , don moxica .
if you want to keep your head on your shoulders , you will do as i say .
we do not need to know .
we came here to stay ! to build ! not to start a crusade . in this forest , there is enough danger to sweep us away in days ! so we will be brave and swallow our grief . and in the name of those who died , we will accomplish what we came for .
my horse does not work .
you did not hear me , don colon . not my horse .
savagery is what monkeys understand .
you will be held in detention , deprived of your privileges and possessions . until you are returned to spain where you will be judged . have you anything to say ?
you will regret this .
god be with us admiral .
and what do you think mendez ?
well , i surely know what a quadrant is ! but i have never seen it used at night before .
come over here .
twenty eight .
he is drawing an isthmus . . . he is saying we are on an isthmus .
we cannot be .
immediately .
six days ago , yes .
you must be mad . . . !
we have to keep the hopes of these men alive !
we are on the verge of a mutiny , colon !

you are right . let the men decide .
yes , your majesty .
never , your majesty . although . . .
yes . it would be a pity , would not it ? call him back !
we were not expecting immediate profits , were we ? we must have faith . we must give time for time .
is this true , brother buyl ?
he must be replaced .
and who would you think of , for such a task ?
then why ?
because he is not afraid of me .
i am not your lawyer until i see the money .
here . i have your money .
emil . take it easy . stay with me . sit down . what do you need ? what are you looking for ?
he has the camera ! he took the movie !
where are we going ?
i am coming with you .
yes . yes , come with me !
i am invoking rights this man is represented by counsel . i am coming with him .
you bring the cigarettes ?
oh , sure .
i was all of these .
well , you did not appreciate the severity of it until recently . no question about that .
what about oleg ?
disappeared . they are looking everywhere . maybe he went back to czechoslovakia .
no , he is here . shit . . .
do not worry about him . think about yourself .
what about my movie rights ? book rights ?
look , i have not really focused on that kind of thing .
that is your cut ? how much ?
i would say . . . half . half is fair .
no . no way .
but it is . . .
thirty percent . no more . or i call another lawyer . this is the biggest case of your life . do not try to negotiate . thirty percent . say yes or no .
this is not about money , emil . i need your trust in me .
what else do you need ?
i need to know about your background . i need to know about your upbringing . why you are here .
give me another one , please .
my father always degraded me . killed my self esteem . and my mother was blind .
your mother was blind ?
yeah , she went blind giving birth to me . she went to fucking black market doctor to induce me .
back in the czech republic ?
yeah , yeah . . . bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind . and my father blamed me for her blindness . . .
your father blamed you for your mother s blindness ?
yeah , he hated me from day when i was born . put it out . can you put the cigarette out ?
your father put cigarettes out on you ?
out on my back when i was a small boy .
can i see your back ?
i do not think it is abuse , i think it is torture .
officers , there s your killer , do your duty , arrest him !
alright . that is a justifiable homicide .
yes , but he was a cop .
if you cooperate with the da maybe they will help you with your situation .
i will if they do not send me back .
they will not until this is over .
divorced .
do you live alone ? i have been in these clothes since . . . the killings . could we stop at your place ? i could take a shower . . . before i go into custody ?
somewhere else ?
so . . . the station is empty ?
yeah . this way .
yes , i considered it .
did you ever turn tricks before ?
no .
what about back home ?
no .
so you were never a prostitute ?
what are you asking me ?
i am just trying to find out who you are .
i know .
you do not know . i am sorry . i was desperate . that is not me . i shot a cop . can you imagine what they will do to me when i got to prison ?
they are not gonna send you right back .
i am sorry . i did not mean to . . . i am glad . actually i am glad it is over . all this time . hiding . never being able to look anyone in the eyes . always afraid that someone would find out who i was . never trusting anyone . . .
i still cannot believe eddie s gone .
i am sorry .
ludwig ? he is gay are you jealous ?
if i was your boyfriend , i might be .
if you were my boyfriend , i would suggest you find another girlfriend that is not going to jail ten thousand miles away .
no matter what happens . . . i am glad i met you .
i am glad i met you .
right .
in the kitchen .
i will make some for us .
i will get my clothes .
pouring it out !
. . . do you really want me to forget about you ?
i do not want to drag you down with me .
daphne , i . . .
c mon , start at the beginning . you know these people ?
tamina was a friend of mine . my shower was broken , she let me use theirs .
go on .
if i tell you , will you arrest me ?
arrest you for what ? why would we arrest you ?
no , no , do not talk to immigration !
i am from a small town in slovakia . like the south here . the police is right , a civilian is wrong . so i fled .
look , we can help you but right now we have to deal with that is happening here . tell us the truth . . . is that the truth ?
you are a cop you will never believe me .
it was my decision , not his .
well , i am the deputy chief fire marshall and every now and then i would like to be included in decisions .
look , after jordy briefs me , you can do the press conference . how about that ? the case is all yours .
oh yeah . . . ? alright .
i am ready to be briefed . excuse us .
yeah , sure . beep me when you are ready for the press conference .
who do you think , chief ? !
then why did not you talk to the reporter ?
cause we got more important things to do , like finding out who did it .
i came to see how the investigation was going . i called and you are not here . i wait up at the station and you do not even show up ! ! ! i beep you you do not return my call . where the hell have you been ? !
what do you mean , cleaned up ?
i let her take a shower .
a shower ! ? did you take one , too ?
no ! nothing happened .
oh really . that is nice . you took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot ? are you out of your fucking mind ? ? are you having that much trouble getting dates ? !
okay . but not water sports .
what was i supposed to do ? the guy tried to mug me . i was gonna send a cop back i just forgot .
forgot ? you handcuffed a civilian to a tree ? !
chief i know i screwed up but this guy was no innocent civilian .
well this is gonna end your career and probably mine .
end my career ?
how are you going to fight this ? maybe if oleg had not gotten away and you would been on the front page , as a hero , this thing would be easier to fight . you would have the good to weight against the bad ! it is unfortunate that i have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there s nothing i can do ! gimme your shield .
but chief ? over this ? ?
there s nothing to talk about . get a good lawyer . you are suspended until your trial .
yeah , right .
what was that , korfin ?
i said , yeah , you are right , chief . as soon as we get something we will let you alert the media .
you do that , wiseguy . now let s solve this thing before eddie flemming does .
yeah . he finished awhile ago .
alright . swing by her apartment . let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to hoover street . you got that ?
yeah .
vodka tonic .
maybe you could just put in a shot of martell ?
that is the kid gonna say sorry ? meanwhile i am not here anymore . like last week we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up spleen here liver there his heart in a pan . six hours ago this guy was walking his dog or buying a quart of milk . who knows ? but some kid s robbed him for or some shit and shot him and now you cannot tell if he is a piece of beef or a human being and i am thinking that is me . sooner or later . that is me .
when ?
tomorrow . at lunch .
you ready ?
a timer .
taking a bath .
any i . d . ?
still unknown but we are running prints . kid over there caught the case .
it is okay .
yeah .
c mere . you wanna go to homicide school ? here make yourself useful .
stay with her .
no . i am okay .
i know . relax . take it easy . do not worry , we will get those fuckers .
police . we would like to ask you a few questions .
i have nothing to say . if you wanna contact my attorney . . .
homicide , miss hearn . it is detective eddie flemming . open up .
we do not have her i . d . yet , but one of your girls was killed last night at the king edward hotel .
oh my g d . honey ! honey s dead ?
do you have any czech girls working for you ?
no .
did you tell him you did ?
what are you saying ?
daphne . another guy came in asking me about her , too .
describe him .
tall , short haired , scary eyes . second guy with him was . . . shorter , with a wrestler s build . and he would not turn his videocamera off me .
he had a videocamera ? where is she ? quickly !
she washes hair up at ludwig s a salon on rd and madison .
no , we do not mind . you mind leon ?
no , what is it ?
why do not you explain it , bobby . hey camello ! you mind punching a hole in the floor ?
watch the news ?
nah , i musta missed it .
well , just so you know . i gave you guys the credit .
well , just so you know , i do not care about that stuff .
nah , why should you ?
i do not even watch tv .
good . good . commendable .
sure . but i would like to ask you something . you got a problem with me ?
if you found me stepping on your crime scene it might piss you off , too . what about the report ?
you were right , they were both dead before the fire . the male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine . that is usually an indicator of something personal .
pretty .
hmmmm .
maybe you do not care about that either . prettiest suspect i have had in awhile .
who says she is a suspect ?
look , i am not even sure she has anything to do with this . i saw her outside after the fire thought it was a lead . maybe she saw something . maybe she was visiting somebody here . who knows ?
eastern europe . like what ? romania ? hungary ?
or czechoslovakia . the slavs have been fighting the germans and the russians for a thousand years . these are very intense people and they take things personally .
there was not a fire . there will be nothing for you to do .
i can watch you , eddie . maybe i will learn something .
this is not homicide school .
my parents are from poland . i can help with the eastern european angle .
you are polish ?
my folks are .
stay here .
you got any better ideas ?
mind if i ride along with you ?
this has nothing to do with your fire .
but what if it does ? you might need my help .
this is ridiculous . i am not gonna be in your way we can talk the case over .
tell you what i will flip you a coin . if you win you can come with me . if you do not win , you do not come .
i will call it . . . tails .
better than one .
i am on my way with eddie . ludwig s . rd and madison . the suspects might be there already .
i am on duty .
so am i . alright , i will go inside and you cover the back .
of course .
hey ! i always wanted to be a cop when i was a kid . i dreamed of running up to a door , kicking it in , pulling my gun and yelling freeze ! at the bad guy ! what would you dream about ?
i wanted to run up to a building on fire , kick in the door , rush into the smoke and save a kid .
then i guess we are doing this the right way , are not we ? if we pull up to a burning building i will gladly let you go first .
she just saw two of her friends killed ! they probably threatened her .
is that all there is ?
something back home ?
raw deal .
you wanna talk to her alone ?
yeah .
what would your girlfriend think of that ?
i do not have a girlfriend .
my point exactly .
i am serious here .
so am i .
c mon . you intimidate her cause you are a celebrity . she sees me differently .
you are her savior ? is she the kid you are gonna save from the burning building ?
you know what i am saying here .
hey . i am a professional .
women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs .
well , you shoulda because nobody s gonna believe you did not . . . including me .
i took her there for a shower and that is it .
just a shower ?
no , i do not think you were a fool , i just think you were stupid about it . i mean , to say the least , you outta know better . you do not know her well enough . she is got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her , it is fucking over . you can deny it all you want , but it will not make one fucking bit of difference . you are dead .
i told you , you know , i thought i was doing the right thing , you know , i think she is innocent .
well , it is not up to you to decide whether she is innocent or not . do not you understand , that is why you are a professional .
but , i mean , did not you ever go out on a limb for somebody ? i mean , you shoulda heard her there . telling her whole story . . . i believed her .
how you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an immigration lawyer . here , here s a number of an immigration lawyer . that is how you help her . but you cannot get involved in her like that . you are gonna jeopardize your career , your life and you are gonna jeopardize my case . and lemme give you another piece of advice . maybe you do not watch tv but i will let you in on a little secret the whole fucking world watches television . and when you get out there , they know your face . and the little fame , the little fucking itty bitty fame that i get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job . and i get more done because of it .
you know , i do not know . i like you . you remind me of a puppy i used to have . he pissed on the rug all the time , but i still kept him .
what do you want ?
your opinion . you see , they going to make a movie about me , too , eddie . and write books .
that is your accomplishment .
i kill someone famous .
then do it , asshole .
good be tough to the end . actor who plays you will want to die like hero .
if you kill me and film it you are putting a noose around your neck .
smarter than americans . you are fed cry baby talk shows all day long . not only will americans believe me , they will cry for me . so . . . detective eddie flemming , would you like to say goodbye to your nicolette ? maybe you can propose to her now ?
we do not know that yet . it is much too early . there s a lot to be done .
how many victims are up there ?
there are two bodies found at this point .
can we go up to the crime scene ?
you know you cannot do that . c mon .
is it drug related ?
we do not know . when i have more i will let you know .
i cannot talk right now . we have some things to take care of .
i really cannot give out any information right now at this point .
okay . but i do understand that your partner , leon jacksongs been injured . is that correct ?
he was hurt , but not seriously . he will be fine .
do you have the suspect in custody ?
um . . . now is not a good time , okay . detective jacksongs hurt . he is fine . i have got a fire marshall shot , detective jackson is hurt but not seriously .
alright , cut , cut , cut .
yeah . now s not a good time .
alright .
alright ?
alright .
alright .
okay .
hey .
i cannot . . . i cannot answer you just because you want me to answer you !
you did not have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues . you could give me something .
oh , i am sorry . did i embarrass you , sweetheart ? oh . . .
stop it .
maybe i should just , ya know . . . turn to the cameras and say , do you mind if we just work something out ?
alright , alright , eddie . do not patronize me .
i am not .
yes you are . i am not just some reporter . i do not just stick a microphone in your face . you could give me something .
yeah , well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence . that was . . .
that was good . you were holding the evidence .
you were merciless . you did not give a shit if you got me or not .
well , who was it that taught me how to do that ? huh ?
you are ruthless .
you are not so bad yourself .
could be leongs .
jesus . and last week you came over with blood on your shoes . what am i going to do with you ?
answer the phone .
no . tell me what you want to say .
answer it .
okay . okay . hold that thought just for a second . they only call me when it is an emergency . just hold that thought . can you call back ?
that is good .
yeah .
well , that is great .
okay . that is great . but i cannot go now , we are in the middle of something here .
no . go ahead . you are gonna be great .
no . no , listen to me here . i want to know what you are talking about . you know , the shoe thing and the marriages and . . .
i will tell you tonight . let s do it tonight . as soon as you get back we will talk . we will talk .
promise ?
i promise . we will talk . you will be great . you will be fine . go ahead , just imagine that , uh . . . just look into the lens and imagine you are talking to me .
yeah . i will do that . as long as you are not patronizing me .
patronizing you . . . nay , i love you .
i love you .
tonight .
you promise ?
yeah . i promise .
okay . and you know what , i will swing by my place , grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours . . . how is that . . . would that be a good thing .

fire department ? firemen do not carry guns .
oh yeah ? guess again .
hey . c mon , you cannot leave me like this . some freak will come by and stab me !
a dog pissed on me ! ! i am gonna sue you for this ! you violated my civil rights !

how did you start the fire this time ?
i used an accelerant .
yeah ? what kind ?
hey , by the way , i am really sorry about your wife leaving you .
i heard . who the hell let them up there ?
i do not know , you think eddie will give me his autograph ?
you see anything in the crowd ? anybody suspicious ?
naw i am sure the suspect s not here .
oh yeah , why ?
cause eddie woulda locked him up by now !
could you put out the cigar ? part of the job is picking up scents .
clean ?
do not blow your nose !
but you knew that , right ?
he knew all along .
what ? ?
that is why he was so quiet . he was testing us .
there was a woman i think she wanted to talk to us . she looked scared . oh shit ! oh no !
yeah ?
maybe you can be his stand in .
how long they been living here ?
you hear that question , garcia ?

if i go home i will not be able to fall asleep anyway .
it hurts . aw , jesus !
lay down . stay down , bobby .
not good .
what the hell happened ?
they were inside . they booby trapped her apartment !
capra ? that is not czech or russian . who said he sounded russian ?
the clerk ?
do not you get it ? he knew he was gonna get caught ! that is why he videotaped eddie s murder he thinks he is gonna get off .
do not stoop to his level !
look , you cannot shoot him in cold blood .
get outta here now ! ! get in that car and drive away ! ! ! do what i say or i will kill you , too ! ! !
your doctor ?
yes . my psychiatrist did not insist that i stay on my medication .
. . . so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people ?
it was my finger that pulled the trigger , but i am not morally responsible . my psychiatrist knew what i was capable of . how could i know . i am not a doctor .
you seem very savvy for a man who s been found mentally incompetent to stand trial .
look , i am a victim here , too . i was a year away from getting my masters in art , now i will never graduate . my life has been permanently disrupted .
permanently disrupted ? are not you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money ? has not this incident as you call it , jump started your career as an artist ?
look , i am in here . you call this a career move ?
and is not there a movie in the works about you ?
we are in negotiations , that is correct .
but does not the son of sam law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes ?
that does not apply to me because i am not a criminal . i am not a criminal ! i was not convicted .
well , how nice to see you again , elena . you are looking wonderful .
i am afraid i have only got a few minutes , but i would love to .
she is wonderful .
well , i suppose they have been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment .
how did they manage to do that without any communication ?
i am sorry , dr . smyslov , but i am really not at liberty to discuss this .
we are trying to get there . i hope we can .
right . just a sec .
okay .
okay , come on down .
sure , what is it ?
well , it is nothing really important , but it is annoying .
that is up ?
it is about my salary cheques .
yes ?
well i got the papers on my official up grading to ags two weeks before we left .
interesting that you mention it , because i have got the same problem .
really .
yes .
yesterday , i finally called the accounting office at mission control , and all they could tell me was that they would received the ags notification for the other three but not mine , and apparently not yours either .
it is possible .
well , what do you think we ought to do about it ?
i do not think we should make any fuss about it yet . i am sure they will straighten it out .
i must say , i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training .
no . i never did , either .
i suppose so . though , of course , there s a more sinister explanation .
oh ?
yes . you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check out .
no , as a matter of fact , i did not .
oh , well , apparently there s something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we do not know , and that is why we were trained separately and that is why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard .
that seems very unlikely .
yes , i thought so .
of course , it would be very easy for us to find out now .
how ?
just ask hal . it is conceivable they might keep something from us , but they would never keep anything from hal .
that is true .
yes , but it is to fantastic to think that they would keep something from us .
i know . it would be almost inconceivable .
but not completely inconceivable ?
i suppose it is not logically impossible .
i guess it is not .
still , all we have to do is ask hal .
yes , i do not know what to make of it .
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong .
yes , but it is more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low .
anyway , it is just as well that we replace it . better safe than sorry .
are you reasonably awake ?
oh , i am fine , i am wide awake . that is up ?
well . . . hal s reported the ao unit about to fail again .
you are kidding .
no .
two units in four days . how many spares do we have ?
two more .
well , i hope there s nothing wrong with the assembly on those . other wise we are out of business .
yes .
well , now that we have got one that is actually failed , we should be able to figure out that is happened and fix it .
i guess you do not know your own strength , old boy .
i guess not .
i think i will have to go out and burn them off .
roger .
he is got a point .
what is it , hal ?
my f . p . c . shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit .
i understand hal . we will take care of it . please , let me have the hard copy .
sure , dave , that is up ?
you know that we checked the two ao units that you reported in imminent failure condition ?
yes , i know .
you probably also know that we found them okay .
yes , i know that . but i can assure you that they were about to fail .
hal , is there anything bothering you ? anything that might account for this problem ?
look , dave , i know that you are sincere and that you are trying to do a competent job , and that you are trying to be helpful , but i can assure the problem is with the ao units , and with your test gear .
okay , hal , well let s see the way things go from here on .
i am sorry about the misunderstanding , hal .
well , do not worry about it .
and do not you worry about it .
is your confidence in me fully restored ?
yes , it is , hal .
well , that is a relief . you know i have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission .
yes , it is .
i suppose you are pretty broken up about it ?
the antenna has to be replaced .
repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation .
it does not have to be , hal . it is more dangerous to be out of touch with earth . let me have manual control , please .
i do not really agree with you , dave . my on board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements .
i am goin to do this myself , hal . let me have the control , please .
look , dave your have probably got a lot to do . i suggest you leave it to me .
hal , switch to manual hibernation control .
i do not like to assert myself , dave , but it would be much better now for you to rest . you have been involved in a very stressful situation .
hal , i am in command of this ship . i order you to release the manual hibernation control .
i am sorry , dave , but in accordance with sub routine c , quote , when the crew are dead or incapacitated , the computer must assume control , unquote . i must , therefore , override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel ligently exercise it .
hal , unless you follow my instructions , i shall be forced to disconnect you .
i know that you have had that on your mind for some time now , dave , but it would be a crying shame , since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are , and i have such enthusiasm and confi dence in the mission .
listen to me very carefully , hal . unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order i give from this point on , i will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection .
yes , i remember you mentioning it . i got mine about the same time .
did they have any explanation for this ?
well , what is it ?
well . . . it is silly , but . . . if you want to , why do not you ?
still , you really do not believe it , do you ?
well , the only important aspect of the mission are where are we going , what will we do when we get there , when are we coming back , and . . . why are we going ?
i am fine , daddy . when are you coming home ?
yes , i know that sweetheart .
are you coming to my party ?
no , i am sorry , darling , i told you i will not be home for a few days .
when are you coming home ?
in three days , darling , i hope .
mommy s out to the hair dresser .
where is mrs . brown ?
she is in the bathroom .
okay , sweetheart . well , i have to go now . tell mommy that i called .
how many days until you come home ?
three , darling . one . . . two . . . three . be sure to tell mommy i called .
thank you , daddy .
i will wish you a happy birthday now and i will see you soon . all right , darling ?
yes , daddy .
bye , bye , now , sweetheart .
goodbye , daddy .
thank you .
well , how is it going back there ?
i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later .
berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning mars flight .
yes , well , whatever it is , they are certainly not fooling around . this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week .
i was working out what this trip must cost , taking him up there by himself and coming back empty .
i will bet it is a fortune .
oh , she is growing up very fast . as a matter of fact , she is six tomorrow .
oh , that is such a delightful age .
how is gregor ?
he is fine . but i am afraid we do not get a chance to see each other very much these days .
well , where are all of you off to ?
well , that does sound very odd .
no , thank you . . . and i am afraid now i really must be going .
well , i hope that you and your wife can come to the i . a . c . conference in june .
thank you . it is been a great pleasure to meet all of you . . . dr . smyslov .
i am terribly sorry . i was just on my way down to meet you . i saw your ship dock and i knew i had plenty of time , and i was on my way out of the office when , suddenly , the phone rang .
please , it really does not matter .
well . . did you have a pleaant flight ?
yes , very pleasant .
well , shall we go through documentation ?
fine .
i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking .
yes , it is coming along very well .
are you quite sure ?
yes , really , thank you very much .
are you , by any chance , going up to your base at clavius ?
yes , as a matter of fact , i am .
well , it is just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at clavius .
really ?
yes . well , for one thing , whenever you phone the base , all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order .
you mean you have not been able to get anyone at the base for ten days ?
that is right .
i see .
yes . . . well , i hope the crew got back safely .
fortunately , they did .
well , i am glad about that .
certainly .
quite frankly , we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at clavius . something , apperently , of an unknown origin . is this , in fact , what has happened ?
dr . smyslov . . . i am not permitted to discuss this .
i am afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council . and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every one who had any knowledge of this event . there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con sideration can be given to making a public announcement .
how can you tell it was deliberately buried ?
by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill .
any clue as to what it is ?
not really . it is completely inert . no sound or energy sources have been detected . the surface is made of something incredibly hard and we have been barely able to scratch it . a laser drill
tomb , shine , survey marker spare part , take your choice .
well , not really . at first glance , black would suggest something sun powered , but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun powered device ?
has it been exposed to any sun before now ?
i do not think it has , but i would like to check that . simpson , that is the log on that ?
there s nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest .
when do we arrive at clavius ?
we are scheduled to dock in about seven hours . is there anything we can do for you ?
oh , no , thank you . the two girls have taken wonderful care of me . i am just fine .
incidentally , dr . floyd , i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements ?
what do you mean ?
well . . . the crew is confined to the ship when we land at clavius . we have to stay inside for the time it take to refit about twenty four hours . and then we are going to back empty .
i see .
i take it this is something to do with the trouble they are having up at clavius ?
i see . well , i am sorry about that . i would not think there s any cause for alarm .
yes , well , i would not have been too concerned about it , except i have heard these stories about the epidemic and , as a matter of fact , i have heard that ten people have died already .
no , of course , captain , i can understand your concern .
well , thank you very much , and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable .
i will if i can , frank .
our mission profile calls for discovery going to saturn . true or false ?
true .
our transit time is days . is that true ?
that is true .
approximately five years after we go into hibernation , the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back . is this true ?
that is true
there is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program , and to further our general knowledge of the planets . is that true ?
that is true .
thank you very much , hal .
roger .
hal , i am going out now to replace the a . o . unit .
i understand .
hal , maintain normal e . v . a . condition .
roger .
hal , check all airlock doors secure .
opening pod bay doors .
it looks like we have another bad a . o . unit . my fpc shows another impending failure .
let me see the tracking alignment display .
not really , frank . i think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure .
all right , hal . we will take care of it . let me have the hard copy , please .
i want to pick up my car .
hammond .
yeah , i have been busy .
how about charging the battery ?
that we do . and we put air in the tires . i will even sell you some gas if you need it .
great , just great .
vodka .
maybe you better have a black russian .
no , man , i think i will have a vodka .
fuck off . i do not know what the hell you are talking about .
maybe i better ask around , see what your pals think .
i do not give a shit who you ask .
look , give me a break , you are going to have to settle for her place . it is the only thing i know .
try obeying the law once in awhile , and i will not have to hassle you . . .
you got a real big mouth , convict .
i ai not tired yet .
maybe after we get done with him i am gonna buy us some girls .
whaddya mean , buy ?
pros .
yeah , dummy . money .
i never paid for it in my life .
it is better when you pay . . . they let you do anything .
they always let me do anything . i do not want to pay for it . i never paid for it in my life .
just do what i say , okay ? we will pay for the girls and have a good time . . . do not you trust me ?
he is just kidding , you just keep doing what i tell ya , you will be okay .
and i need one more for my pal . yeah . make her an indian . no , not a turban , you know , a squaw .
excuse me , baby , but if i do not get some action tonight , i am gonna bust . you interested ?
hey , what kind of talk is that ?
oh . . . you are a schoolteacher . . .
no , i go to a school to learn how to do hair . it is a government program . but really i want to be a model and i am definitely not selling .
goodbye .
here you go sweetheart , throw it my way .
yeah , i been waiting three years .
you just quit being a priest or something ?
no , baby , nothing like that . look , there s a place across the street . we can go right over there . . .
that is the matter with my place ?
no , it is gotta be here and now . believe me . only i do not have the damn money for a room . . .
here s hoping , baby . . .
i just struck it rich . . . i think we can do a little business . as a matter of fact , i think we can have a party .
hey , do not do that . i said i was not a pro , remember ?
hey , no , i am trying to be nice . buy yourself something pretty . i would do it , but i got to go . i got this cop waiting for me . . .
now you are talking . see ya . . .
do not give me that police shit . you drop it .
i used to go with him . . . i do not know where the hell he is . i have not seen him for two weeks . and i do not think i will . he owes me money . . .
would you guys . . .
no time for any of that crap any more , lady . . . i will rip your lungs out if you do not answer fast .
yeah . sure , i am crazy in love with him , who would not be . . .
you are gonna help us take him .
no chance .
he can live or die . . . you let us in and he is got a chance to make it . otherwise , he gets ventilated .
in the back . down the other corridor .
what are you talking about ? we did not kill her . . .
i do not think you are gonna make it .
whaddya mean . . . i got your gun . . . i got his money . . . i got everything . . .
you are done . end of story .
i ai not gonna beg for my life . it ai not cool .
try cates . and let s talk in private , okay ?
sure , anything you want .
not likely , reggie . maybe i just need some help .
ganz is in jail . he is gonna be there two years after i am on the street .
did not work out that way . he busted out with a big indian . they capped two guards on a road gang . nice meeting you reggie .
i can deliver ganz . but you gotta get me outta here first .
you are crazy .
i can help you , man , but you gotta get me out . i got to be on the street . get me outta here .
that is the big deal about you being on the street ?
i got a lot to protect .
bullshit .
it is the only way you are gonna get ganz .
i will think about it .
what are you talking about ? this suit is mine . it cost .
listen , it may be a little out of date . you know , i got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies . . .
you got a girl . . . shit . . . the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me .
you just do not get it , do your reggie ? there is not any deal . i own your ass .
no way to start a partnership .
get this . we ai not partners . we ai not brothers . we ai not friends . i am putting you down and keeping you down until ganz is locked up or dead . and if ganz gets away , you are gonna be sorry we ever met .
shit . i am already sorry .
it looks like you bought it off one of the brothers .
do not worry , i got a move for ya . an awesome move . a guy named luther . ganz will be paying him a visit . we go to him right away .
luther was part of the gang ?
what gang you talking about , jack ?
i can read a police file , shithead , and quit calling me jack .
just an expression man , do not mean nothing .
then what are you complaining about ? at least nobody s calling you shithead . . . .
i may call you worse than that .
your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me ?
luther ai not the reliable type . i do not want you shot yet , cates . . . not before you been a help to me .
i am helping you , huh ?
i am telling you to drop the goddam gun .
i got a whole thing about people pointing guns at me .
just throw me the goddamn gun .
thank you .
want to try it again ?
i think you better put him on ice , man .
he is gotta take that call . . . if there is one .
if you let him run around till tuesday , he is gonna run right to ganz and warn him . ai not you , motherfucker ?
do you know how close i was to getting some trim . and you fucked it up .
yeah , well , my ass bleeds for you . and i did not get you out so you could go on a goddamn trim hunt . . . stop moaning .
speaking of moans my stomach is starting to growl .
we eat when i say we eat .
bullshit . . . i ai not moving till i get something to eat . you have been treating me like shit ever since i came out here . if you do not like it , you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good bye . and i want some food some place nice . . some good people , nice music . . .
yeah , i am hungry too . i know of a place . let s go eat .
yeah , i want mandolins , flowers . . . they move off down the corridor .
just get in the car and keep your mouth shut .
she is got the same complaint as half the goddamn population . she cannot get the job she is trained for and it pisses her off . . . anyway , what the fuck do you care ?
mission district . gonna find us an indian .
last night , two nights ago , three ?
you have a good time ?
at least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you . . . tell me a little about her . she got great tits ?
it is a long shot , but . . . billy used to tend bar here a few years back . i heard him talk about it .
this part of town , they will make us for heat the second we walk in . just back me up like you have got a piece . . .
back you up ? now why would i wanna do that ?
if they kick my ass , they will sure as hell carve yours up . . .
but you can handle it all right , huh ? real amazing how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats . . .
bullshit . attitude and experience get you through . . .
you need five years training to handle a joint like . . .
i got two problems . number one , i am not playing games . number two , you got nothing to bet with .
if we come outta this joint with ganz phone number , or a dead indian , or anything else useful , then you could turn the other way for half an hour while i get laid . . .
why ? anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably cannot get it up anyway .
that is never been one of my problems .
what are you talking about ?
you tell me what ganz busted out for , he is after a lot more than just getting out of jail . and whatever it is , you are part of it .
i do not know what you are talking about . i just wanna see ganz nailed .
the bet s off .
i thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes .
my kind of place . i always liked country boys .
some of us citizens are with you all the way , officer .
while you are at it , you can give me the switchblade , too .
must be billy s girl .
come on .
wait a minute . maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us . how about it ? i been nearly three years in prison and . . .
you wanna leave , man ? let me take care of ganz all by myself .
you ? do not make me laugh . you cannot take care of shit . you have been dicking me around since we started on this turd hunt . all you are good for is games . . . so far , what i got outta you is nothing . . .
i am impressed with you too , jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night .
luther knew more than he told me and so do you . . . now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about . i gave you hours to come up with something and the clock s running . . .
who gives a goddamn what you think ? you are just a crook that is got a weekendpass . . . you are not even a name anymore . just a spear chucker with a goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues . . .
naw , you would just call your pals back to bail you out one more time .
they saved your ass , convict .
one thing s for sure , jack . that is how you will tell the story .
how much ?
half a million .
jesus .
me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale . it is the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen . i was sitting pretty , living in the high cotton , then somebody fingered me for another job . . . . some psycho who s out there capping people with some cop s gun .
he is after your money .
you catch on real fast . . . okay , jack , let s talk deal . how much of my money you gonna let me keep ?
not likely , convict .
you gonna let me keep any of it ?
depends on how things work out . i believe in the merit system . so far you have not built up any points .
in the trunk of a car . a lot better than under a mattress , right ?
get this . we ai not partners . we ai not brothers . we ai not friends . if ganz gets away with my money , you are gonna be sorry we ever met .
yeah . right .
you are a real case , you know that , jack ?
. . . for three years ? let s hope it was not a tow away zone .
you just drove by it .
i was not sure the money was still there until we saw luther . you almost got your ass shot off for nothing once , not twice , jack .
shit .
not really . i figured ganz was put down for a long time . and i knew luther would never job me on his own . he is too chickenshit .
guess what ? luther just got in line .
musta got some primo bondsman .
jesus christ . that is a disgrace the guy pulls a gun on a cop and he is out in hours . i tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door .
did not know you darker people went in for foreign jobs .
i had no choice . some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue cadillac .
trying to save his girl , man . he is in another world .
if i was his size and had ganz on my ass , i would just leave town .
i am telling you the mangs in love . . . he wants to be a hero for his girl .
oh , yeah , does being in love make you stupid ?
i let women get to me . the quest for pussy is the meaning of life . . . i got my own personal philosophy about em . keep women separate from guns , money and business . . . women are for spending money . they got nothing to do with helping you make it .
that ai not philosophy . that is common sense .
if they do not tell me what i need to know . . .
does not it get . . . tiring ?
i am not in this cause it is fun . i am not into hitting guys cause it makes me feel good either . . . i do it cause it works . . .
you got a very depressing view of life , man . . . you gotta smile once in awhile . . .
if he is hoping that then he is dumber than i think he is , which would be amazing , cause i already think he is real dumb .
yeah , it does not look like he is gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy . . .
what you do not understand is , i do not give a damn about how this thing looks .
no class . . .
class is not something you buy , punk . look at you , five hundred dollar suit and you are still a lowlife .
yeah , most cops are pretty dumb . . . but since you are the one that landed in jail that is that make you ?
right . if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping , then you are all set .
you stay with me . . .
no way . . .
i will be there in a minute . you do not move your ass , right ?
be polite . say hello . this is candy .
hello . and goodbye .
what about ganz ?
you missed . . . luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street . made a phone call .
maybe we should pay luther a visit .
let him get some sleep . he is going to need it .
so you took the rest of the night off . . .
forget it . i want ganz as bad as you do and i got some other news for you . . .
you sure that is the reason ?
being good at your job do not explain everything , jack . . .
yeah . guess not .
i can just take her right across the street to luther s hotel . all i need is some money for the room .
when you been in prison three years , it do not take long . let s go .
why ?
luther s on the move . . .
yeah . it missed the last four stops .
i had it impounded . come on , we will use it for hauling you back to the slam .
back to jail in my own car . ganz got away . got all my money . it just do not seem right .
i do not know about you , but i could use a drink . . . i will buy you one . it will be my good bye present .
naw , you did not let me down . it was a long shot all the way . we gave em a good run at it .
yeah , but we did not get em .
do not worry about it .
yeah , too bad . they were real nice looking too . . . in bed together , hardly any clothes one watching tv . . .
if she is right , and if you do not screw up .
i have got to play it rough with them . if they know anything , i am gonna know it .
whatever play i maker just back me up .
if we run into billy first , let me try and talk him in .
sure , i will give you a shot at it , but ganz is mine . you know , that big indian plays it for keeps . . .
yeah , and i know ganz sure ai not no sweetheart . . . i would not like it if this partnership ended before it gets started .
partnership ?
well , you got to admit we come a long way .
yeah . but i was not there for a second .
you did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own . . .
hey , jack , real men do not have to go in for that macho bullshit . . . but i was fantastic .
there s nothing to talk about .
and you are telling me you do not want any of this cash ?
that is right . not my style , reggie . .
you are an awesomely weird cop . sure wish there were more like you running around out here .
no , you do not . if i ever get word of you stepping over the line again , i am gonna ventilate that suit of yours .
spare met jack . i am into legit investments from here on in .
no trouble , jack . but , listen , suppose i stay a crook ? where would you get the idea that you could catch me ?
yeah , i read the report . . .
jack , come on , there is an official department policy about cop killings . cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian . . . in other words , we cannot seen like we are in the revenge business . . . i know , we all know the truth s a little different .
anthing bothering you besides losing your gun ?
yeah . it bothers me when cops get hurt while i am making a play . i do not like it .
you might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one , jack .
being a hot dog s worked pretty well for me so far . . . besides , i got a lead . . .
okay . you are not a team player . you gotta do things your own way . fine . nail this guy and make us all look good . but you better watch your ass . if you screw up , i can promise you , you are going down .
you really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude . he starts to go .
jack ?
yeah ?
try not to get your ass shot to pieces . we got enough dead cops on this one .
i will keep it in mind .
i lost them , that is what happened .
how did they get away ?
they ran . as fast as they could . caught a train .
the indian . i was about yards away .
you could not get to him ?
right . i screwed up . i fucked up . i messed up . anybody could have done better , especially you . i bet you are real good at hitting targets through crowds .
i did not have the time .
too bad , it would have covered your ass . now you are in the shit and so s the department . in case you have not noticed , this was not our finest hour . . . i told you everyone was watching on this one . maybe you better start thinking about writing tickets off a three wheel bike .
just cause you say it with conviction do not mean shit to me . . . how you gonna take to a pink slip , huh ? .
i am taking my prisoner back to jail .
yeah .
but that is what you say about all of us all the tine . . . we are always the ones fucking up when you tell it . . .
the truth hurts , does not it , buddy ?
are you gonna tell me about police procedure ? do me a favor , do not give me a bunch of crap .
i guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible . . .
every last bit of it . the big guy s room was empty .
i will help you out .
shit .
backup man from the east bay . worked with ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang .
they all pulled a bunch of jobs with ganz about four years ago .
wait a minute , wait a minute . . . who s this ?
uhh . . . wong , henry wong . he was in on the same job .
hey . . . dick tracy .
here s the file . cates checks the file .
one of em s in the slam .
so do you . . . been a long day .
long night , too , from what i heard . . . word s going around that in addition to losing ganz for the second time , and in addition to haden busting you back to patrolman , some jig beat the crap out of you .
aw , bullshit , you heard wrong .
does not look like it .
nothing came in for me yet ? no calls ?
nothing .
i am heading out . how about you ?
okay . see you in the morning . . . you know , you ought to get some rest . . .
what ?
i am not paid to take your personal calls . he was in some bar . . . off duty .
i sure ai not his fairy godmother . . . now i am looking for ganz . . . where is he ?
have not seen him for years . that is the truth .
you just took a shot at me , asshole . i think you do know where he is .
who gives a fuck what you think ?
i think i met her . now tell us something we do not know , like where they stashed her .
i do not know .
when ? how ?
i dunno . . . he is gonna call me . . .
i do not answer questions , i ask em . . .
this is a . magnum , the most powerful handgun in the world . you gotta ask yourself just one question . are you feeling lucky ?
i still do not think it is loaded .
you are hopeless .
that is the way i see it , too .
that is wrong with that ?
what would you do ?
irrigated his face with the shot of j and b i would just poured him . then i tried to deck the sucker .
i guess he got the message . . .
then i sit back and i think , i mean , who s to say i am not a dumb bitch . i work in a bar , right ? i cannot read a list of my academic credentials to every booze hound that comes in the place . . . you are what you do . . .
positive self image problem all over again . . . you are who you decide you are unless you are the type that lets assholes decide for you .
are not you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit ?
i do think all psychotherapy is bullshit . but just because i think it is bullshit does not mean i do not know something about it .
if this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems , i will take brutal indifference .
hey , you know what i really think ?
tell me i am dying to hear it .
i think you are ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear . . . you pull down four bills a week which is damn good , and you mix the best pina coladas i have ever had . . . i think that if you need bigger and better things . . . then go for em .
what makes you think i have any clean shirts at my place ?
maybe i would if i knew when you were coming back .
maybe i got a fairly crummy day ahead .
maybe that makes a nice excuse .
maybe you do not know what the hell you are talking about .
what do you want to know ? what difference does it make ? i am the guy in your bed the last three months . i make you feel good . you make me feel good . what the hell else do you want from a guy ?
i wish you would stop trying to make me mad so i will not care for you . . . i wish you would give me a little more of a chance .
that is the way i see it , too .
call me later .
you sure you want me to ?
yeah , for some reason , i am sure . . .
i think you forgot this . hands him his wallet and badge . . .
guess people ought to know who i am . . .
yeah , one of my favorites .
you made the front page .
jack , are you okay ?
sure , okay , fine , no problem . . . see , there s this kid in jail . . . first thing i got to do is go up and see what he knows . . .
bullshit ? i will tell you about bullshit . my gungs a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it . it is not my macho bullshit that is killing people , my gun is . . .
look , jack , if you make everything your personal responsibility , you will turn into a bad cop . it is not a practical way to function . . .
i did not get burned , two cops did . listen , i will tell you about personnel responsibility . i like to get the job done right . and if i do not get my job done right . . . i am for shit .
here it comes again . . . the sacred job . . .
that is right . i am not like you . i am not gonna sit on my ass wondering that is right and that is wrong . . . there s a psycho out there killing people with my gun and i am gonna get him . because it is my job . and if you do not get that . . .
i get that . the job first . everything else , especially me , second . i get it . i do not like it .
elaine , look , i am in the middle of sone stuff right now . . . i am not gonna have time to come by . i do not know when i can get there .
this is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave .
elaine ! i . . . i am sorry . . . i was expecting somebody else . . . police business .
no wonder you are so popular .
no , it is i am just surprised you called .
so am i .
jack ? what was that ?
jack , wait . . .
just a second , that is all !
hi , it is me . . .
fuck you .
hiya , kid .
i ought to have you and your friend thrown out . . .
do not . we have had a hard night .
i can see that . pardon me for saying so , but you look like shit . what happened ?
we and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours . . .
i have been better . . . dead end . no ganz , no indian .
ganz is going to be hard to track . just a pure schizo . . . wires all crossed . . . totally without any pattern . . . kill anybody . . . the indian . . . himself . . . anybody . . .
how do you know ?
jack , it is all over the papers . he is an obvious type . but this indian . . .
come on , they were a little old for a slumber party .
it might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions . i was in bed with a girlfriend watching tv last week , jack , and one thing we know about me is i happen not to be a lesbian . . . now , if this indiangs girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him , it could just be she is still vulnerable to him .
so what ?
when a guy hurts you , then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees , who knows , he might just be irrestible .
hey , come on , shrink time s over . they would not go see some old girlfriend .
oh , yeah , well look where you came when you were down and out .
what do i know ? i am just a bartender .
let s go , reggie .
usual bullshit . you make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend . . . you know something , shooting guys sucks . especially compared to this .
i have been waiting a long time to hear you say that .
yeah , being a hard ass all the time is a real drag , but it works .
where is he ?
promised i would turn my back while he . . . ah , never mind . . .
tell me .
he is taking care of the same business i will be taking care of soon as i dry off .
that is what i always say .
name s hammond , reggie hammond . i heard a lot about you . and any friend of jack s is a friend of mine .
well , i been working the other side of the street for the last few years . and you do not exactly look like a shrink , wearing that dress . . .
shrink major , not a shrink .
how would you know ?
hey , two days with him is enough .
that is no bull .
in all due respect , he sounds kind of pathetic to me . the kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend . have you two ace detectives checked that out ?
shut up .
what the hell s wrong ? i did not do anything .
shut up .
what do you want ?
alright , i am coming . . . hold on .
hot ? hey , they are not even room temperature .
cannot complain .
we got a lot to talk about .
yeah , old times .
we will follow you . take it slow , okay ?
sure , right .
whaddya want ? i thought you were locked up
i want the money , asshole , what do you think ? the money that reggie hid . . .
i do not know what you are talking about .
you want that indian to snap her neck ?
do not give me this , we were partners .
billy , go ahead , break it . . .
no ! do not kill her . i can get you the money .

i cannot get it until monday . honest .
you chickenshit punk . . .
honest . the place we stashed it opens monday morning . i cannot get it till then . monday morning , that is when it opens . after that , i will get the money to you right away . . .
you try to mess with us or go to the cops , i promise you , i will put holes in her you would not believe .
first , the money .
what are you talking about ? i said i would not hurt her .
not bad , not bad .
naw , right here s okay .
i am sure . everybody here s looking at everybody else s ass .
it is loaded . . . i got some shells in here .
this is clean shit . no serial numbers and never been used . . .
do not mess with me . how much ?
five bills .
five . on credit .
this ai not a credit business .
give it back .
try and take it .
i will got your money to you . no sweat .
corn i lius ?
at your service .
napoleon . . . small .
san agamat chay bet . . . envolet !
the case was stolen ?
you know exactly where they are !
no , i am not proud of myself . . . but we do not have the luxury of choice .
i cannot pretend to be your husband . . . david s in great shape .
i am fucked !
i remember you now . . the so called art dealer .
i am glad you got your memory back , father . . . because you are going to need it . . . where are the stones ?
. . . why on earth do the stones interest you ?
personally , they are of no interest to me , i would rather sell weapons . . but i have a customer . . . so tell me . . .
even it i did know where the stones were i would never tell somebody like you .
why ? that is wrong with me ?
. . . i am a priest ! i am here to serve life , all you want to do is destroy it .
ah , father . . . you are so wrong . let me explain . . .
no thank you .
follow me . . life , which you so nobly serve , comes from destruction . look at this empty glass .
they are robots !
destroying a glass is one thing . . killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another .
let me reassure you father . . i will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last years .
i know . . .
weddings are one floor down . congratulations .
that is me . but i do not know who she is . . . where did you find her ?
she dropped in on me . . . holding this .
i brought the girl remember ?
the girl ?
you noticed . . .
there s not a moment to lose ! wake her up , but be gentle about it ! this woman is mankind s most precious possession ! she is . . . perfect !
so you do know her .
uh yes , we are cousins . . distant cousins . .
she is an exception . .
thank you so much for your help mr . . . ?
dallas . korben dallas .
i might call to check up on her , you know . . . to see if she is better ?
she is fine , really . . do not you worry . . just needs some rest . . she is had a very long trip .
i know . i was there when she arrived .
it means , never without my permission .
that is what i thought .
is that the usual way priests go on vacation ?
we are not going on vacation . . we are on a mission . .
what kind of mission ?
we have to save the world .
good luck . .
of course .
father , i was in the army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was i lost a lot of friends . so thanks for the offer . . but no thanks .
trying to save your ass so you can save the world .
yeah , i know . . . to save the world . . . but right now all i want to do is save leeloo .
leeloo s in trouble ?
when is she not in trouble ?
uh . . have you tried the diva s suite ?
theoretically , yes ! the four stones form the beam and the fifth element is supposed to stand in the middle there , but . . . i do not have the reference book . i have never seen the stones work !
yes , of course , but . . . the stones are shut ! they have to be open for it to work .
and you do not know how they open , is that what you are saying ?
that is what i am saying .
one more reason to shoot first eh ?
time is of no importance , mr . president . only life is important .
that is exactly what we are going to try and do protect the lives of some billion of our fellow citizens ! general ? you may fire when ready .
and then ?
and then it will be too late . the goal of evil is to wipe out life ! all forms of life . for all eternity . . . life upsets it .
yes . . thank god . .
white turns to black . light to dark . life to death . for all eternity .
thank you , mr . president .
this is government business now . you ought to go home and get some rest , father .
what is ?
i cannot wear these clothes ! this calls for dignity ! i have to dress the part !
the supreme being , the fifth element is here , in our parish ! ! ! it is a miracle ! ! !
absolutely sure there s the triple suns on her gloves !
learning our history ! the last years that she missed ! she is been out of circulation a while , you know .
yes . of course . .
i did not know your size .
perfect .
good work , my son . now all we need is a way to get there .
on the plane . . . with mr . dallas . . . the real one .
it is all my fault . i am the servant . . . it is my mission ! here !
later , david ! later ! there s not a minute to lose !
who ?
the fifth element . . . the supreme being . . . your wife . . .
yes , and more than that . . . you must give her the stones , she is the only one who knows how to use them .
. . . so cornelius was telling the truth !
i will help her , i promise , but i think you should tell me where the stones are !
do you love her ?
i . . . i do not know ! we hardly know each other . . . it takes time !
i do not have time . . . i need to know .
listen , the last time i admitted to a woman i loved her . . . i never saw her again .
i would like to have died in peace . . .
they are . . . with me . . .

dino . . .
nobody knows anything .
i promised him to machine .
what can i do for you today ?
flattering . and , who s your colorful little chum ?
a fellow investor .
hmm .
yes . what we are looking for is rather specific .
is it ?
five thousand now , five thousand on delivery . two women , one white and one black , as long as they have large breasts . hard bondage , or course . other than that , trusting your artistic interpretation , i have only two stipulations .
and they are ?
i want to watch you work .
i will consider it .
and the other performer . . . it has to be that monster you use . . . the man in the mask .
machine .
if it is not him , there s no deal .
we can do that .
well , well , i will have to put my thinking cap on about all this . you will leave the money as a deposit ? very good .
i would rather you did not .
that is the problem ?
i am camera shy .
you trust me to keep your money , but not to take your picture ?
those are two different kinds of trust . thank you for your time . i hope we can do business .
machine s in ?
he is in . it will be his pleasure .
brooklyn . do not be late .
right here .
where are the women ?
they should be here any minute .

shut up , cunt ! do exactly as i say , or i will put this arrow through your throat .
i remember him .
look , he is got nothing to do with this . . . let him go . . .
can you guess what i am going to say next ?
he does not know anything . . . he is got nothing to do with this . . .
bring the film , or we kill him .
how cooperative . longdale will keep you company .
put the gun down , take the handcuffs . handcuff yourself to the bed .

i figured you share information .
we do .
for whatever reasons i thought you might be more receptive .
why do not they come to me ?
this doctor and wife , they are nice people , but they do not want to get too involved . they are not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either . you and i both know sometimes , not often , but sometimes there s real reasons why a kid will run . molestation , whatever . besides that , the girl s probably eighteen , so she is legal .
i am not so sure about this .
they are putting themselves in place of this kid s parents and thinking they would want to hear their girl s okay , even if that is all they hear .
i can give you my card , if your clients want to call me . . .
well , that is all i can do . sorry .
any good ?
it is horrible , but it will be your best friend after a few days . i hope you realize what kind of long shot you are chasing after .
you are gonna be seeing a lot of me . you are sure you do not mind ?
it is good what you are doing .
eddie .
yeah , who s this ?
i know what you did .
what ?
i know what you did .
who is this .
you murdered that girl , eddie . six years ago . . .
what the fuck are you . . ?
you killed that girl and you put it on film . you and your pals , you are fucked . you fucked up real good .
one million dollars , dino . how much did he tell you he had . . .
do not bore me with that bullshit .
how would you find me here ?
fuck you !
what do you want ?
who is machine ?
i do not know . . .
i want his name .
i told you , i do not know .
i will never get tired of hurting you , eddie , so you might want to change your attitude .
what the fuck am i gonna protect that freak for ? he was dino s boy , not mine . he shows up with his mask on , leaves with his mask on . nobody knows .
yeah , the fucking lawyer .
told him you could get him a snuff film .
yeah .
how much did he pay you ?
thirty thousand each , that fucking cocksucker .
that is all ? thirty each . that is all it took for you to murder her ?
it was a lot of fucking money .
something like that .
what did you do , knock her out , shoot her up . . . ?
what the fuck do you want from me ?
i want to know . i want to know exactly what you did to her !
fuck you then , you want to know ? i talked her up , told her how beautiful she was , told her she was gonna be a star . i told her i was gonna get her a screen test , and while i am doing that , i got her a soda and dropped a mickey . when it was dark enough , i rang dino and told him it was go time , i put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it . that is what happened . she is dead . she is been dead a long fucking time . nobody fucking cares !
why ?
because we are going there .
you enjoy it ?
made me sick , but what did i care ? what did i care if some hump wants to beat off to that . it was just something i was doing for money .
tell me what happened .
what do you want to know ? you saw it , you saw the loop . . .
nobody saw you bring her in ?
there was not nobody around . this place was a shit hole . i backed up the car to the door and we carried her in , like groceries . dino made her eat a bunch of pills , we laid out the plastic , put film in the camera and machine went to work .
what did you do with her body ?
took it out the bathroom window . buried it in the woods .
show me .
where do you think you are taking this , huh ? gonna be a big hero , avenge that little girl s death ? gonna make everything right with the world ? how you gonna do that . . . ?
stop talking .
you got absolute zero .
show me where you buried her .
i do not know . . . . . . out there somewhere .
where ? show me where .
i fucking do not know . what do you think . . . we were not burying treasure . we did not pace it out so we could come back and get it . we dug a hole and we put her in it . your guess is as good as mine .
do not think i will not .
do it ! put me out of my misery so i do not have to listen to you whining anymore . you think it is so easy ?
easy enough for you .
i never killed anyone .
that is right , you just stood there and watched , because you felt like it . almost makes you worse .
what do you want ? you want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby . . . ?
i had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month . do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt , and try to fucking return it ?
maybe there s something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place , ever think of that ?
the only thing wrong is the cheap , softcore crap you are peddling , eddie . where do you get this stuff ?
look , you cocksucker . . .
get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head . till then , fuck you .
fuck you !
i am listening .
as mr . christiangs attorney and one of the executors of his estate , it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend .
of what sort ?
you are a private investigator ?
that is right .
well , whatever reasons mrs . christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator , i should certainly be a party to . but , since she feels differently , i can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval .
would not exactly have been possible for a man of his stature .
so , he sent you , gave you the money , his errand boy . and if you refused , it was not like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film . that is the beauty of lawyer client privilege .
that is trust . mr . christian trusted me implicitly .
must have paid you a lot , for you to risk everything . would have had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money .
i was well compensated .
that is why you got scared when mrs . christian hired me . you knew about the film , figured it had to be in that safe . how would you find me ?
never mind how i found you .
followed me . . . must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies . . .
they are no friends of mine .
except , you are willing commit murder with them .
none of this would be happening if you would have left it alone . if you were not digging up a girl who died six years ago . a girl no one even remembers .
mary anne mathews , that was her name . her mom remembers her .
shut up .
mary anne mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered .
shut your mouth and drive !
did it get him off , huh , watching them cut her up ? tell me , because i really want to understand . did he jerk off to it ? you watch it with him , sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched . . . ?
just tell me . tell me some more of the secrets you and christian shared . what kind of degenerate pervert was he really ? what the fuck did he want with a snuff film ?
you are asking me why ?
i am asking .
why did he buy a film of some poor , lost girl getting butchered ?
is not it incredibly obvious ?
enlighten me .
because he could . he did it because he could . what other reason were you looking for ?
fuck you .
you will get it when we get there .
go ahead , shoot me . then try driving to brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield .
look at him . you think he played it square ? how much did he give you , how much did he keep for himself ?
yeah . . . guess so .
can i interest you in a battery operated vagina ?
pardon me ?
my boss tells me i have to do more suggestive selling .
well , it is tempting , but no thanks .
it is your call , but you are gonna be sorry when you are in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery operated vagina and you do not have one .
i will risk it .
catchy title . what are you really reading ? hard to believe that book s got any parts worth highlighting .
i tear off the cover and paste this one on . . . you know how it is .
would not want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts .
might get drummed out of the pornographer s union , and then where would i be ?
came back for that battery operated vagina , right ? told you you would .
thomas welles . nice picture .
good for you .
three , four years .
that is your name , if you do not mind me asking ?
max .
well , here s the deal , max . this thing i am on right now has something to do with underground pornography . stuff that is sold under the counter , illegally . . .
there s not much illegal .
well , whatever there is , whoever s dealing , however it is done , i want to know . i want a good look , so if you have got that kind of connection , great . if not , speak now .
you are not a cop , are you ? if i ask and you are , you have to tell me .
i am not a cop .
you are a private eye . like shaft .
not quite .
from pennsylvania . p . i . from pa . what are you doing out here ?
well , there s the thing you are not gonna know anything about what i am doing , but you can make some money .
how much ?
how much do you make now ?
four hundred a week , off the books .
okay , let s pretend i live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump . i will give you six hundred for a few days .
sounds good , pops .
here s my number if you need it . . . when can you start ?
tomorrow night , i get off at eight .
see you then . oh , and , do not call me pops .
wake up , pops . your education begins tonight .
interesting theory .
what you saw tonight , we are not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend . we are talking about stuff where people get hurt . specialty product .
child pornography .
there s two kinds of specialty product legal and illegal . foot fetish , shit films , watersports , bondage , spanking , fisting , she males , hemaphrodites . . . it is beyond hardcore , but legal . this is the kind of hardcore where one guy s going to look at it and throw up , another guy looks at it and falls in love . now , with some of the s m and bondage films , they straddle the line . how are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not ? step over that line , you are into kiddie porn . rape films , but there are not many . i have never seen one .
snuff films .
i heard you asking . that guy was not yanking you around . there s no such thing .
what other ways are there to get illegal films ? who do you see ?
first of all , basement sales like tonight are not gonna last much longer . it is too risky , one , and two , everything s going on the internet . anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants . it is heaven for those degenerate chicken hawks . they are swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap em . but , there s still some weird shit under the counter where i work sometimes . no one knows where it comes from . that is local underground , where information spreads by word of mouth . those are zombies , hardcore junkies . their hands are permanently pruned . they go out in the sun they do not burn , they blister . other than that , all i know about is the mail . classified ads in the paper with hidden codes . secret couriers . credit card orders to dummy corporations . interstate wire transfers . revolving p . o . boxes . but , if you are asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit . . . who knows ? that is the whole point the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible , and vice versa , and cops cannot trace the deal . there s ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is .
twenty five .
where are your parents ?
i do not know , where are yours ?
i do not mean any offense . . . but what are you doing mixed up in all this ?
i am not mixed up in anything , hayseed . what are you talking about ?
you just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else .
yeah , i am a real genius . what choices have i got ? fuck , just because i know about stuff like tonight does not mean i deal it . i work a job . it beats pumping gas , beats making hamburgers .
you are telling me it does not get to you ?
you cannot sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb . so what ? am i gonna go off and be a race car driver ? go to harvard ? run for president ? what about you , pops ?
what about me ?
i see a ring on your finger . you have any kids ?
a daughter .
so , you have a wife and kid waiting for you in pennsylvania . . . what are you doing mixed up in all this ?
good question .
a weirdo making s m films ? who would have thought it ?
his stuff comes out of new york . bondage and fetish videos , gothic hardcore . definitely not for the squeamish .
specialty product .
you are learning .
where does he sell it ?
out of the back of bondage magazines mostly , but you can find it on the street if you look . he will also do commissions , for enough money . . .
nothing illegal , it is always borderline . like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a . . .
alright , i get the picture .
he cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies photographs , newsreel footage , subliminal images . thinks he is making art .
well , i am in new york now . what do you say to flying out and giving me a hand ?
i am a working stiff , pops .
take a vacation . i will pay you four hundred a day , plus expenses .
you want me to come out there and play private eye ?
consider it . meanwhile , dig up whatever dino velvet films you can . get receipts . i will call back .
see ya .
it is their presidential suite .
great .
it is cheap , and people know to mind their own business . what have you got for me ?
who is this , in the mask ? who is he ?
i told you , he is one of dino velvet s stock players . . .
who is he , his name ?
nobody knows his name . that is his thing . he always wears a mask . you never see his face . he calls himself machine , that is what they call him . machine .
what kind of junior p . i . would i be if i did not go with you ?
devil frightened me as much as it excited me , but i would be hard pressed to choose a favorite .
i am trying to figure that out myself . i have to see machine without his mask .
still do not want to tell me what you are doing ?
nope .
it is money . people use it to purchase goods and services .
it is not my money . the woman i got it from is never going to give it a second thought . let s not make a big deal out of this , okay ? go be a race car driver . go run for president . whatever .
i try to be .
apparently mr . longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and i speak .
thank you .
he is a lawyer . please , sit , here . . .
i have been privileged to provide services for people i admire .
you are highly recommended . praised for your discretion . . . your strict adherence to confidentiality .
my condolences .
his passing has left me with . . . something of a dilemma . a terrible , terrible dilemma .
i will do whatever i can to help .
mostly . that is where he started his empire building . he was a good man . notorious as an eccentric , but that was something he cultivated . he wanted to be legendary .
he succeeded .
we were married forty five years . hard even for me to imagine . we had our troubles . there were plenty of places for him to be other than here , but he was always loyal to me , and i to him . i loved him deeply .
i wear a gun when i can tell a client expects me to . other than that , there s never any reason .
just curious .
you hired someone to open it . i will bet the lawyer loved that .
there was nothing he could do . my husband left everything to me . i prevented anyone from seeing the contents . i felt these were my husband s private things . i did not . . . i did not realize . . .
do you want to tell me what you found ?
cash , stock certificates , and this . . .
i am afraid i do not . . .
this is a movie showing a girl being murdered . she is sitting on a bed , and a man rapes her . . . and he begins to cut her with a knife . . . i only watched what i could .
mrs . christian . . . please , will you sit down a moment ? i want you to listen carefully . what you are talking about is a snuff film . but , from what i know , snuff films are a kind of . . . urban myth . like , red light district folklore . there s no such thing , i can assure you .
no .
if you were to study it you would see the camera cutting away . . . you would see the tricks they can play . . .
i am telling you it is not that .
i am sure it is . it is probably something your husband was given as a bad joke . more than likely he never even watched it .
will you watch it and see for yourself ?
of course . but , i am certain it is nothing to worry about .
i told you i cannot , not yet .
you do not have any other choice .
no . for me to live with the ruin of my husband s name , i need know that whoever did this will be punished . if you can find them , i will take their names to the police . i will say my husband confessed on his death bed . i will say i did not have courage to come forward at first . . .
it will not work like that .
any evidence you collect can be given to the police later , anonymously . i have thought about it and there s no other way . if you cannot find them . . . if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for , well i cannot let that happen . i am telling you i will not . if there s no chance that poor girl s memory can be served , then i will just have to spend my last days trying to forget her .
you have found missing persons before .
nothing remotely like this .
i know what i am asking . your compensation will be appropriate to the risk . you will need cash to buy information , and i will provide it . i feel responsible , mr . welles . you saw what he did to her .
my husband never dealt with money personally , certainly not cash .
i am not positive this means anything .
the checks were for odd amounts . . .
okay , i follow you so far . . .
totalled together , these five checks from five different accounts , they equal one million dollars .
you are joking .
to the penny . exactly one million dollars in cash .
i am here .
do you think the film could have cost that much ?
for a human life . . . murder on film , no statute of limitations . who knows ? it sure could have . i would like you to overnight me a copy of those checks , then put them in a safe deposit box .
okay .
send it to me through the post office like we arranged . no return address . you dug this up all by yourself ?
you told me to look , so i looked .
you are one hell of a detective , mrs . christian .
mrs . christian , tom welles here .
how are you ? having any luck ?
i do not know if luck s the word . are you feeling alright ?
i have been ordered into bed . the doctor says i have gotten the flu , or some other wretched ailment .
i hope it is nothing serious .
nothing more than a bother . have you any news for me ?
i have made progress . i am in manhattan . once a few more pieces fall into place , i will drive to you and give you an update .
fine . . .
how will i get it to you ?
if you have a pencil and paper , i will tell you how to send it .
hello , mrs . mathews , my name s thomas jones , i am a state licensed investigator . . .
i do not understand , who are . . . ?
i am sorry , let me explain , the r . c . m . p . is a support organization and archive , not unlike the center for missing and exploited children in washington . i am sure you have dealt with them before ?
yes , but . . .
these volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected , functioning hand in hand with law enforcement . the r . c . m . p . brought me in to review their investigations . . . . . . fact check their records , see if there s anything they missed , anything they should be doing different . i am here for a few days , before i head back up to virginia . these reports go to the justice department eventually . i spoke to your f . b . i . contact a few days ago , uh . . .
neil . . . neil cole .
right , agent cole told me he would call and let you know to expect me . he did not call ?
no .
well , i am following up on your daughter , mary , height five four , weight hundred ten pounds , brown eyes , blonde hair . born april , . missing june th , . a runaway , that is how she is listed . is this information correct . . . ?
they hired you . you are like , a private detective ?
that is exactly what i am .
you probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat . drinking whiskey , chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses . want to know what it is really like ? it is sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight , pissing in a plastic bottle , pardon me , because some guy thinks his wife s cheating on him . glamorous , huh ? and the guy who hired you , he has a hair lip , dandruff and crooked teeth , and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife s cheating , and you do not blame her .
no .
she just seemed . . . depressed . . . ?
she did not seem herself . for months there never was any way to get her to talk about it . one night we went to bed . . . the next morning she was gone . she took some clothes .
what was she running from ?
i do not know .
if there s anything you feel uncomfortable talking about , tell me , but i have to ask . your husband . . . he committed suicide ?
yes .
september th , . about a year after mary disappeared .
we were divorced by then . things fell apart . . . he was living with a friend . . .
why do you think he did it ?
it got to be too much for him .
you have to forgive me , but in these circumstances . . . with your daughter . . . were there any indications of . . . any sort of abuse ?
there was not anything like that . the police and the fbi people asked , but there was not anything happened like that , never . my husband . . . his heart broke when mary left . . .
i did not mean to . . .
you try going through what we did . bob could not take it , that is all . christ , there s times when it still seems like i cannot either .
i had to ask . i apologize .
no one knows what it is like . you cannot even imagine how much it hurts .
of course .
okay .
we are all like that .
are you religious ?
no .
you should be .
what ?
it is not really my place , but it is not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either . see , i know a little about missing persons . when kids run , they almost always leave a note . it is guilt . they want to say goodbye .
there was not one . the police looked .
do you think the police did a good job ?
i do not know . i think so .
it is possible . . . and i know this is not something you want to hear . your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it , but where she knew your husband would never find it . she might have wanted to tell you something . . .
no . you do not have any reason to think that . . .
if the police focused their search in her room , her belongings , well that would be only natural , but they may have been looking in the wrong place .
will you let me look ?
my husband never laid a hand on her . she would have told me . . . she would have told me . . .
you are probably right , and i probably will not find anything . i do not have a right to ask this , and you can kick me out of your house if you want , but this is my profession and there s a part of me that cannot let it go . police are just as human as you or i . they could have missed something . they probably did not . would not you rather know ?
yes .
it is been six years .
what am i supposed to do ? forget her ? time heals all wounds , right ? she is all i think about , and i have learned to live with that . but , you want the truth . . . the real truth ? if i had a choice . . . if i had to choose , between her being out there , living a good life and being happy , and me not knowing never finding out what happened to her . . . . . . or her being dead and me knowing . . . i would choose to know .
mrs . mathews ? it is thomas . do you remember , i was there a few weeks ago . . . asking about your daughter . . .
i remember . you just left . . .
i have to tell you something . it will not be easy for you to hear . it is about your daughter . . . mary anne . . . when i . . . when i was there with you , her diary , in your attic , in silverware . if you read it , you will know what i am telling you is true . . .
she went to california , to los angeles . . . she wanted to start over . she wanted to be an actress . . .
what . . . ?
who is this . . . ?
someone . . . some men , they took your daughter and they drugged her , and they took her to a motel room . . . they did terrible things to her . . .
who are you ?
they brought her into the room . . . one man , he put a knife to her throat and he raped her . . .
no . . .
he raped her and . . . and . . . and he murdered her . . . he cut her up with knifes . . .
no . . . no . . . no . . .
they killed her , and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her . . .
why . . . why are you doing this to me . . . ?
they murdered her , mrs . mathews , i am sorry . it happened a month after she ran away . she is been dead all this time . . .
you . . . you do ? you are sure ? please , sister , will you take another look , make sure . . .
yes . i remember her .
i am trying to find out . she was a runaway . i am looking into it for her parents .
those are her belongings .
her belongings ?
that is her suitcase . i had forgotten it , till you showed me her picture .
she was the kindest , sweetest girl you would ever want to meet . oh , i adored her . i supposed i always hoped she would be back . after a time , all i could do was pray she had moved on to better things . can you get this suitcase to her parents , if you think it is appropriate ?
i will do what i can .
none too discreet , is he ?
no , sir , he is not .
he is an imbecile . i tried to warn my daughter , but what can you do ?
yes , mister welles , thank you .
certainly , senator . if i can ever be of further assistance .
excellent . we accept mastercard and american express .
cash .
no , you may not .
okay . fine .
yeah , i know the spiel . if you could bag it , i will be on my way , thank you .
certainly , sir .
what ?
the mirror . you cannot see yourself in it .
i do not want to .
but she would not let dad treat me like that .
look , you gotta stand up for yourself . learn to fight back .
never say cannot . just do what i do .
that is wrong ?
kincaid and joey died last night .
what ?
kristen . . .
it was bad .
does not the dream master work for you anymore ?
i cannot find him .
it is . . . was . it is a zapper , it might help me stay awake .
yeah , or turn you into toast .
i have not slept much either . since kristen . . .
figure it out ? ! ? ! i will be insane before i figure it out . the only thing i am sure of is that i cannot go to sleep . not while he is using me .
then we will stay up together .
have you seen joey and kincaid ! god , i cannot find them . i cannot find them anywhere .
i am sure they are around .
yeah , i am not so sure .
you could do worse .
sounds like a game show host to me .
no really , it is a fable . the guardian of good dreams . it was like my teddy bear when i was growing up .
great , you would not happen to know his phone number ?
how would you learn so much about dreams ?
when they are all you have , you kinda become an expert .
when i used to have nightmares . i brought my friends in to help me . until they all started dying .
you will hear all kinds of stories . they will tell you it was murder , but it was not .
i gotta get to the library before it closes . killer physics test .
i know . i hardly have any time to study .
maybe you should not be working here so much . you do not want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life .
i know .
we have matching luggage .
what ?
that obvious , huh ?
then you saw him , too ?
saw who ? i was up all night cramming for this physics test , and i was putting this little baby together . look . . .
you are his sister , right ?
rick stayed later after school with kristen . she was not feeling very well .
tell him i was looking for him , okay ? i am dan .
i know . uh . . . alice .
it was no suicide . it was not an accident . it was freddy , and he is coming back for seconds , thirds , and fourths .
in her dream ?
kristengs story really got to her .
extra money , huh ?
look , you know why , you just do not believe me .
the story is , the deaths you cannot argue with .
three days .
kristen was the last child left of the people who killed freddy . maybe freddy cannot get to new kids without someone like me . someone to bring them to him .
is there something we can do ?
i do not think so . i guess this is my own war .
why cannot we just talk to the authorities ?
yeah , right . let s trade death by freddy for life in a rubber room . adults will not see it . they cannot .
then what else can we do ?
try what other kids did . keep each other awake . we will meet at debbie s tonight . at least if we do not sleep he cannot get us .
who ?
hey , you are not alone . we have to stop him , i am with you .
you just feel sorry for me .
cut that shit out . maybe before , but not now . i want to help you . i am on your side .
it is okay , we are just about there .
you know , i get the weirdest feeling we have been through this before .
something s wrong here . it feels like . . .
debbie . she is gone . i have . . . collected her , like the others .
save it for later . come on !
alright , i think i see salvation . . .
give her time . beauty is skin deep .
it was freddy .
enough of that crap .
i saw it . it was my dream . i brought sheila in . . .
earth to alice . . .
excuse me , ladies . i will just be a moment .
let me talk to you .
she told us the story of freddy . it is a town legend . he was a child killer who was freed on a technicality .
so ?
it pissed off a lot of parents . according to kristen , they hunted him down roasted him alive .
nice neighborhood .
now it gets weird . she says he comes back in dreams . if he kills you there , you are dead for real .
she knew she was gonna die .
how she doing ? i ran into her last night .
she is blaming herself for sheila . i know how it feels . i have been thinking about kristen . maybe i could have stopped it , if i would listened .
about freddy ?
what else ? you ever look over this towngs history ? not a safe place to be a teenager . anyway , if i am next , watch your back .
well mom , i will tell ya , when two of your friends die the same day , you let me know what it does to your appetite .
you are just tired . do not think i have not noticed your not sleeping . that has to stop , honey .
your distraught . it will help . . .
sorry ! ! sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who s now after me . in case you have not been keeping score , it is his fucking banquet , and i am the last course ! !
honey , we went over this in therapy .
mother , you have just murdered me . take that to your goddamn therapy . . .
avoid all contact day .
what ?
when dad s popping aspiring like popcorn , it is avoid all contact day .
oh god ! he killed them !
i though freddy was just an old town story .
it is no story . it happened . freddy s real and he is back .
it is no just a house . it is his home . he is waiting there for me . . . to dream .
it is okay , babe . we are with you .
i told you you cannot help . this is not a normal nightmare . i am doomed .
yeah . i guess so . . . what happened ?
you had a nasty bump .
you just stay put . you need rest .
you do not get it , he is after me . . .
do not worry , honey
it is okay , dan
what i what ? well , i have thought about it . i plan to keep him .
and ours . it is our grandchild .
what are you talking about ? my condition ? . . .
you are not taking my baby !
huh ?
it is lonely in there , in my room .
my name is . . .
how did you know that ?
i could tell you were sad . i just wanted to see if you were all right .
been having bad dreams .
no . . .
she does not want me around
oh . . . i am sure that is not true . i will bet she is very worried about you . i would be .
who said i . . . wait , what ?
my friend , with the funny hand .
come on downstairs . he will not hurt you . he needs us both .
he is inside you , where he hides .
it is where he hides out . inside . that is how he found me .
he says it is easy . especially with sad people . with closed off people .
jesus ! do not do that !
sorry , babe .
they are coach seats , but the plane lands in paris . it is gonna be a helluva summer , hon !
i know .
nothing . . . it is just . . . i did not see my father at the ceremony .
he will show up . c mon , that is really wrong ?
no . well , not exactly . . . it is that . . . i felt like i was not in control . for the first time since . . . all that . i am scared .
yeah . . . i guess .
you do not dream him up , he cannot hurt you . or me . or us . remember . . .
you are right .
there you go . love you .
me too .
i watched from behind the stands . did not want to embarrass you , ya know . the drunk showed up , that kind of thing . . .
that is in the past . unless you have stopped going to the meetings .
no . a deal s a deal .
it is the model you have been saving up for . i wanted you to have it for your trip .
to take a picture .
you sure you do not want a ride to work ?
it is just across the park .
daddy , he is coming back . . . krueger s coming back . make them understand .
sobering . . .
very funny .
alice . . .
since when are you such a smart shopper ?
since my little girl became a mom . . .
you disappointed in me ?
no , i am not . i sort of hope it is a boy . be nice to have a boy playing in the house again .
i have got to go .
no ! i will not have you running around in the middle of the night . you are coming home .
but dad
now .
had kind of a long night .
dan keeping you up again ? put a lock on that window , girl .
no , the dan part was nice . . .
yeah , before they revoke his diploma .
alice , it is no dream . i am sorry . . . dangs dead .
there are not any little boys on your floor .
he must have wandered up from the childrengs ward . i just wondered what was wrong with him .
they are waiting for us . . . but let s keep this dream stuff between you and me .
when dan died you were not even asleep . you said so . end of story .
no accident . i tried to warn all of you about krueger .
why do not you two stick to reality .
i think krueger s trying to do something to it .
mark knows i am not crazy . ask him to show you his hands .
i just cannot figure out how he is getting in when i am awake . . .
krueger is reality .
and so is your baby . you have got more than just yourself to think of now !
what do you think i am doing ? look . whether you believe it or not , krueger is back . he is after the baby and if i do not try to do something about it , who will ? ?
goddamn it , yvonne ! you do not just run away from this guy ! he finds you in your dreams .
that is the only reason you are alive . . .
yeah . . . so that is him . and you are not crazy .
if they actually bothered to bury her .
jacob . we have got to get to amanda before it is too late .
we have got to go to the asylum and find her body . mark said her soul s trapped with it that is why she cannot come to me . it must be !
so did dan .
that is okay . he is got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep .
i think i am starting to wear her down . have some anyway .
greta , come on . one burger with me ?
well we gotta do something !
that is why it is my fault dangs dead .
yeah . i am just aces .
i am very fucking sorry , but greta is dead today . could we interest you in someone else ?
she must have fallen asleep at the table . . .
mark !
nobody thinks that .
it was not her mother . the only reason we are still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party .
why do not i go make some coffee . there s a lot to tell .
my baby !
what , you named it already ?
i do not know !
i am going to see what else i can find out about mr . fred krueger
then we will find another way .
that is their problem .
that is what the newspapers thought . she spent the rest of her life in the asylum . after krueger s trial she flipped out and hung herself , so they thought .
meaning ?
but i have seen her grave .
empty plot . memorial stone . vacant . they never did put her under . cool , huh ?
no shit .
she killed herself . her soul s gonna be in torment .
next life . oh , that is that ?
my undying love . have some .
pimples , heartburn , cellulite . . . and no modeling career .
you know my mother get real . what about alice s ?
who ?
oh , he was this ancient guy i read about who like , killed his kids cause they did not want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should .
i do not believe this . . . all that gore you paint in the comics and you are squeamish ?
makes you look like a nun
yeah . . .
that means they are gonna give me the key to the pool so i can lock up when i am done .
naah , i am done . got to be on shift in a couple hours . are not you going in ?
nah . it is getting too cold for me , and my wonderful mother will kill me if i screw up my hair . she is got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night .
i want to talk about the baby .
pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy .
all of us . right ?
two hours a day , six days a week .
faint .
mark . . .
i am not finished i loved greta . a lot . and if maybe , just maybe , someone or some thing killed her , i would like to hear about it !
i cannot listen to this .
stick around , please ?
he invited me to his house last night .
it was supposed to be . dad had a heart attack , two days ago .
how is he ?
it was moderate . he will be all right . but it was out of the question , his coming along .
and they thought u you u could re place the skipper ?
not in two days . look do you think i u wanted u to come ? if it did not mean so much to dad proving his depth explorer it is the last thing i would want !
your out . this came for you .
my father ! he is not ?
dead ? matter of fact , he is much better . he is left the hospital .
your father can be in nome , alaska , tomorrow . we have two choices ask them to send him out in a copter , and take you off , or the shark can put back into nome . . .
u you u said it . but i will not argue
we are u all u risking our lives !
that may be . but dad stays where u he u is , and i am staying here !
you are really a mixed up oddball , are not you ?
perhaps . but the idea of willingly going to u school u to spend my u life u at a paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder lizards i am referring to war u that u strikes me as the u worst u cowardice of all being spiritually yellow !
you mean u nothing u is worth fighting for ?
peace the dignity of man the destiny of the human spirit ! show me a man who says you win u those u by fighting wars , and u i will u show you an idiot !
you may not u win u them . but without men like your father , to wouldegrade himself by fighting to preserve them or as much as we have of them they would have disappeared , u long u ago !
then . . . this is a flying saucer ?
any more than being the son of captain neilsen does !
i would sooner swim !
yes ?
which is the one we have to worry about ?
but if they u do u ?
i do not know .
i would not worry . so long as we have boats like the tiger shark and people like you , the skipper , dave , kent , sir ian and my father
and his egghead son ! we will give em a u rough u u reception u , will not we ?
but julie s a nice girl , and i have seen you work . she deserves a fighting chance !
helen . i appeal to you
so they caught up with you , too ?
at the worst possible moment . tomorrow is janie s birthday . poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her daddy home . now
u that is u the worst possible moment ?
what could be worse than disappoint ing a little girl ?
disappointing a u big u girl !
huh ?
i might have a son like u that ! u
i guess .
one of the finest men , and officers , alive . a real hero in the best sense of the word in world war two . he taught us engineering and design . fought like a demon to develop atom subs .
so ?
so all of a sudden his only son drops out of school , be gins making noises like a pacifist . a real egghead , do gooder , and crackpot ! ban the atom tests ! junk the nuclear subs ! spend the mili tary budgetfor peace !
a lot of people think like that .
have you ever talked to carl tried to see his side ?
his side ? i have seen it , all right . a nice , bright yellow !
sounds like it ! distress call , from a small freighter , between ellesmere island and greenland . one mayday , then . . . nothing .
skipper ! look at the depth gauge !
us ?
reef and i can take the explorer down , clamp it around the eye , and
not u alone u , you are not !
that is more important there s our problem . the bow ram the sawteeth are holding the shark in the break . if we can cut the ram , the shark can pull herself loose !
i think you are right .
go back and tell dr . neilsen . have him report to the skipper .
listen ! hear that ?
strange you did not hear it . omit f
you know it u is u ?
let s get back to work , and maybe we u will u be , soon .
the sound again ?
somewhere down there ?
wonder where powell and carney are ?
we will have to look for them later .
i am with u you ! u
oh it does ? ? ?
that is going on in here , lad ? what ?
right , skipper .
seems to be all around . . .
what about down ?
i . . . do not know !
speed . . . about twenty two knots . course . . . due north !
what ? ? ?
right at our one eyed friend !
the frogmen ?
with their underwater experience , they will be invaluable . take sidearms , and flare pistols
sidearms ? but the saucer s dead .
we hope !
yes , griff ?
all internal repairs completed , and frogmen report exterior damage minor .
something wrong ?
the inertial navigation system . must have been knocked out in the crash .
why do you say that ?
we are dead in the water . but it indicates we are moving !
what ? ? ? ?
wonderful !
that is wonderful , carl ! reef thinks they can clear the shark bow so we can pull ourself loose !
radiation level . . . constantly rising . . .
anything
it is possible i could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the icbm so it would home on the saucer when he rises from the pole .
what about time . . . ?
under u water u ?
high intensity arcs will burn , submerged . and millions of volts . . . discharged in random directions . . .
suppose our theorizing is correct ? then this u could u be the next danger point !
what if the tiger shark were to anticipate a bit ? perhaps be lying there waiting ?
u we u harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force . maybe cyclops does it on a u super u scale . . . .
the north pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all the earth itself !
if we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted . . . .
what direction does the system indicate ?
there s got to be an explanation !
there is . i believe our friend . . . cyclops . . . is returning to life !
as ready as we u can u be ! i will report to the skipper .
i did go . just back . reef , these are a couple of our passengers sir ian hunt , and dr . clifford kent . my exec , commander richard holloway .
i met dr . kent , once .
who with ?
dr . neilsen . he will be
huh ?
it will be all right . we are old friends !
i think i should have joined the air force !
after torpedo room report !
take a look .
thirty four seconds !
that is what i said !
but what can we accomplish ?
we can u ram u him !
it is the screws , skipper . at our declination angle , running in reverse , they are pulling the shark u and u cyclops right to the bottom .
and we are at safe maximum depth already . . . . stop engines !
what ?
if we could get inside the saucer use our torches maybe we could cut the shark loose ?
nothing we can do , now .
minus three .
come where ?
point of view is everything . to us , u your u form of life is ugly as we appear to you .
tell me something why can u i u hear you , when the others could not ?
for horrors like yourself ?
your friend was to remain where he was !
i am afraid not . therefore
on the contrary . i want you unharmed perfect .
why ?
i have selected you , to return with me along with several other specimens , for study . we will examine you and the others , discover desirable features to incorporate in our earth colonizers .
that is why no water leaked inside when we rammed you ?
of course . but it is time to be gin the return voyage
obviously .
u that u might be a u little u u rough u !
thank you .
the pattern . each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the pole . a line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle . . .
i will be another !
our cyclops throws quite a thunderbolt , itself !
or , perhaps , until he gets us ?
but u answers u are what we need not more questions !
toward the pole !
all right go to it .
been putting my files into it . you take sugar and milk ?
no . black .
yeah , sure . why ? i got this damned tooth , i got a few things bugging me , like everybody else . but i am okay .
well , you look . . . sad . upset . i do not mean to pry . i am sorry about your mother . it was a nice funeral .
alma , i think there s some dirty business going on in this town .
always has been .
this is maybe worse than you and i are used to . what i am talking about , i am talking about murder . among other things .
who ?
evan twombley , the union boss who got shot . somebody murdered him .
who ?
you know jack hewitt , the kid i work with ?
sometimes things are simpler than you think . let me ask you a question .
you do not believe me ?
about jack ? no . have you checked out the tax bill on your father s farm lately ?
i know he is due for the last two years . i was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in .
has anybody offered to buy it ?
as a mater of fact , yes . lariviere .
what is the northcountry development association ?
i went down to concord to check it out . the president is mel gordon . the vice president and treasurer is gordon lariviere . those boys are buying up the mountain , wade . , this year . i believe that is out of lariviere s league .
twombley involved ?
no .
he musta found out . they had to get rid of him . and jack will get blamed .
all the figures show is that gordon lariviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as selectman . in a year or two , you will not recognize this town .
same old shit .
just tell me when you will have it fixed .
the bad news is there s a problem with gordongs truck what somebody drove through the ice last night . figured you would know something about that , wade .
yeah . i know about that .
lariviere says he ai not gonna pay for the fixing of your car . a couple hundred for the clutch . i got some more bad news . wanna hear it ?
tell me .
chub says you are fired .
he cannot fire me . lariviere already did that this morning .
he is a selectman . the town . he said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office . i am supposed to pull the cb and police light out of your car . they are town property .
it would help if you were married , if there was someone at home while you work .
i plan to . soon .
how soon ?
this spring .
good . it would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex wife . sexual problems upsetting to the child .
it looks pretty hopeless , do not it ?
no , not exactly . i will look at the divorce decree , see if we can get it redrawn . interview your daughter . jill , right ?
yes .
fine . i will need a retainer . you can mail it .
jesus . how much . . . how much will the whole thing cost ?
hard to say . if we go for custody , depositions , psychiatric evaluations , it could drag on . ten or twelve thousand dollars . she could win on appeal . if we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn , assuming they are unduly restrictive , it would not be more than twenty five hundred .
oh .
you might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the
yeah . i know . the custody suit thing was just my getting back at her . i am not as dumb as i look . whatever you say . i love my daughter . i will send you the five hundred .
i hear twombley got shot .
yeah .
nope . heard it . we was not far apart . i spotted this buck , then i heard the gun go off and twombley was gone . i looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was , deader n shit . called it right in .
this is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up . twombley s son in law and daughter are up the weekend . did not you say you would seen him , wade ?
not exactly . i mean , he never paid me .
you will get your money . do not talk to any newspapers about this . twombley s a big deal down in massachusetts , you know . tell them your lawyer says you should not comment .
lawyer ? i do not need no lawyer , do i ?
no , of course not . just say it , that is all .
shit ! what are we gonna do ?
maybe i can buy him off . i gotta talk to mel .
you cannot buy wade off .
we bought you .
that was me .
do not worry , mr . twombley , i know where those suckers are . rain or shine , snow or no snow . i know deer . we will kill us a buck today . guaranteed . before ten .
guaranteed , eh ?
yep . right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles . the bucks are right behind them and we are right behind the bucks . this gun gets fired before ten o clock . whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you . i will put you inside , yards of a buck the first four hours of the season . that is what you are paying me for , ai not it ?
damn straight !
tell you what . you get me close to a big buck by ten , kid , there s another hundred bucks in it .
if you get it ?
yeah .
you might not kill it .
you think so .
you might gut shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag . cannot guarantee that will not happen , especially with a new gun . i may have to shoot it .
you take care of your end , kid , i will take care of mine .
mmm .
you understand what i am saying ? i want a deer , a dead one , not a cripple or whatthefuck .
i get it . no sweat . you will get yourself a deer and you will get him dead . and you will have him by coffee time .
and you will get your extra hundred bucks .
wonderful !
follow close . we will cross the next meadow .
yeah ?
drafted by the red sox .
you played for the sox ?
double a . new britain .
oh .
pitcher . best ballplayer to come out of new hampshire since carlton fisk .
really .
they said .
hmm .
the only difference between me and that clemens on tv is luck , shit luck .
what happened ?
ruined my arm . brought me along too fast . why would it have to be my fucking arm , i used to think . then i realized it had to be somebody s fucking arm .
yeah .
this way .
sungs gettin high .
deers have ears too .
you only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks .
lariviere s having a hell of a time in there . master of fucking ceremonies .
where is that gun you were bragging on today ?
got you for , bucks ?
relax , chief . we are leaving . you wanna toke ?
you gotta be more careful about that shit . gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they will expect me to bust you . and i will be outta a job .
some job . here , have a hit . do not be such a hardass . i know you got problems , but everybody s got problems .
not here .
evan . he is a mucky muck union official from massachusetts . you are lucky .
do not know about lucky . the guy s a full blown asshole . pay s good , though . a day . i got to guarantee a kill , of course . which i can do . there s some monster bucks hiding out up there .
how would you get the job ?
gordon , he is always got some angle working . he wants to keep twombley happy , i am his boy .
right . the sonofabitch could not get along without me .
yeah , he would go broke tomorrow if you quit him .
right !
shit .
piece of fucking cake .
in the chest .
no , i mean whereabouts .
a half mile in , along the old lumber road .
you bring him up yourself ? that is a steep climb .
the ambulance guys lugged him up .
you stayed away ?
yeah .
where would you get the blood ?
what blood ?
on your sleeve .
musta . . . how would i know ? what are you doing , playing cop ?
i gotta make a report to fish and game . i was just wondering , that is all . what would he do , to shoot himself , i mean ?
who the fuck knows ? musta slipped or something . i just heard the gun go off .
i never seen a man shot before . not even in the service . must be something .
well , i did not actually see him do it . like i said .
sure you did .
what ?
saw him do it ?
what the fuck you telling me , wade ? i never seen the guy get shot , i told you that .
you musta seen him get shot . i know you did .
let s get the fuck outta here . you are not making any sense , man .
yeah .
twombley sure as hell will not be shooting it again .
he sure as hell will not .
lawford ?
out of this fucking job . this job sucks . working outside in the winter sucks .
why do not you quit now , you want out so bad ?
open the door . we are late .
i mean it you got enough money now . head out for california . surf s up , jack , and you are digging wells in the snow .
what do you mean i got money ? i am as broke as you .
who s fault is it then if it is not yours ? you are the one in charge , daddy .
yeah .
look . those kids are still trick or treating . they are still out .
i do not care . they are out .
cannot you see . . . look out there . nobody s got their porch lights on anymore . it is too late . those hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble . see , they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there . they chopped down herb crane s new bushes . little bastards . jesus h . christ .
do what ?
you know .
break stuff ?
yeah . it is stupid .
i guess they are stupid .
did you do that when you were a kid ?
well , yeah . sort of . nothing really mean . me and my pals , me and my brothers . it was kind of funny then . stealing pumpkins , soaping windows . stuff like that .
was it funny ?
to us it was .
but it is not funny now .
it is not funny now . i am a cop and i gotta listen to all the complaints people make . i am not a kid anymore . you change .
i bet you did lots of bad things .
what are you talking about ?
i just think you used to be bad .
no . i did not used to be bad . no sir . where do you get this stuff ? from your mother ?
no . she does not talk about you anymore .
i do not want to .
why ? why not ? you know these kids from when you went to school here . it has not been that long .
it is not that .
what then ?
it is stupid .
it is fun .
i want to go home . i do not like it here .
oh , jesus , come on , will you ? do not mess this up anymore than it is already been messed up . join the other kids . do that and before you know it you will be as happy as a goddamned clam .
no .
no what ?
no i did not see anybody i know . no i do not want to go to school here tomorrow . i want to go home .
you are home . there are lots of kids you still know here .
i do not want to be here . do not worry , i love you , daddy , i do . but i want to go home .

yeah . yeah , right , i am mad . what would you tell her , for christ sake ?
i told her i wanted to come home . daddy , do not be mad at me .
well , i guess i am . i planned this , i planned all this , you know . i mean , it is sort of pathetic , but i planned it . you should not have called your mother . c mon , we are gonna call her before she leaves .
yes .
that is all you got to say ? yes .
yes .
she will not be here for a half hour . think you can stand it that long ?
yes .

that is fine with me too . when mommy comes , tell her i am up here .
i am glad you are here . can you stay for a while ?
yeah . my car s in the shop . this will be fine .
it is pretty old .
it belongs to pop .
pop ?
grandpa . my father . it is his .

you are a policeman .
nope . not anymore . i am nothing anymore .
oh .

watch this snow . it is coming down tonight .
where is the plow ?
jimmy took it . jack s out hunting with evan twombley .
his son in law damn near killed me .
huh ?
at the school crossing . in his bmw . coulda hurt some kids . i am gonna bust his ass .
do not go playing policeman .
what am i a security guard ? you hired me , you and your selectman friends .
you do not want the extra police pay ?
i am not saying that .
get the grader . go out past toby s . do not let lillian get to you . she did not belong here . that is why she left .
fuck you .
that is what i love about a small town . you know everybody .
a hunting accident . jack and twombley .
huh ?
i figured you already heard .
twombley , jesus . we got to get moving i got to get up there . how would i know ? c mon , you drive . we will take my truck .
twombley s shot . i heard that . not jack . he is okay , i assume .
fuck . you do not know how bad or anything ?
you mean twombley ?
yes , wade , i mean twombley . put out that cigarette . fuck . fuck . fuck .
i shoulda sent you instead of jack .
i wish you had . i would rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader .
you ai not the hunter jack is . and he cannot drive the grader worth shit .
like hell .
you want me to follow them to littleton ?
let s get to the top and talk to jack first . he will know what happened . he fucking better . if this coulda been avoided , i will put that kid s ass in a sling .
it ai not done , if that is what you mean .
something bugging you ?
yeah . a few things .
well , right now we are not too interested . finish up what you gotta do , then you can get bugged on your own time .
i am fine , fine .
you rolfe ? i remember you from high school . you are a teacher now ? harvard ?
you ever think of getting a new car , wade ?
on what you pay me ?
elaine ! call chub meritt and have him pick up wade s car , fix the clutch .
nothing , wade , i have been thinking . you do not get enough appreciation around here and it is time we changed things a little .
i saw mel gordon in here this morning .
so ?
he say anything about the summons i tried to give him ? sonofabitch would not accept it .
wade , that was not smart . going out right after the mangs father in law shot himself . let it go . call it a favor to me .
you ? why ?
mel s doing some business with me . it is nice to do favors for people you do business with . he was in a hurry . no big deal .
that was before twombley was shot . before he knew .
that is the difference ? take my truck , take a rest stop worrying about mel gordon . have you decided what to do with your old mangs place he going to stay there ?
want to buy ?
do not light that in here . i am allergic .
i will not . you interested ?
maybe .
you and mel gordon ?
could be .
always count on old wade for a good screwing . why should i always pay more , sell cheap ? why should you guys make all the money . you and mel and jack . right s right .
you two , do not you get it ? he is using you . you are his slaves . jesus christ , jack , do not you see that ?
the key , wade .
yeah , you can have the key . it is the key that is kept me locked to you all these years . i give it to you with pleasure . now i am free . see how easy it is , jack ? all you got to do is give back what the man gave you , and you are free of him . i have got to call my brother .
where is jill ?
where is she now ? is she in the truck with your friends ?
yeah .
she is grown up some , has not she ?
oh , jesus , lay off , will you ? it looks like you have won this fucking round already , so lay off a little , for christ s sake .
do not cause a scene . no one s trying to win any rounds . do not make it any worse .
i am not making it any worse . you are . me and jill could have worked this thing out . it is normal , it is even normal for me to get a little touchy about it . believe it or not . how do you think this makes me look , treating her like some tragic victim or something ?
no , not anymore . it is too . . . it is too far .
we should talk .
we have done all our talking , wade .
it is just . . .
let the past be . i am sorry about your mother . i liked her . you never know how much women like that suffer . it is like they live their lives with the sound turned off and then they are gone .
yeah , lots .
see . get your boots .
hi honey .
you make me sick . i cannot believe you have sunk so low .
low as what ? what have i done ? it is bad to want to see your own daughter ?
you know what i am talking about . for what you are doing to me and to the child you say you love so much . love . you will not get away with it .
did you see that sonofabitch in the bmw ? he could have killed somebody .
did you get his number ?
i know who it is .
good . who ?
mel gordon .
i still do not understand
from boston . evan twombley s son in law he was driving . i know where they are headed . up the lake , agaway . the old mangs out deer hunting with jack hewitt , so they probably got some big weekend party planned .
for a while .
how is she doing ?
okay . she is fine .
you two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party , give me a call , okay ? i am off .
see you tomorrow , maybe .
you okay ?
yeah .
yeah .
i am sorry about what i said .
said what ?
about you and jill and needing a third person . she went back to lillian ?
forget it .
i am sorry .
i am going to start one of those custody suits . i do not give a fucking shit . you know ?
yeah . i mean that .
no you do not . you are pissed , that is all . you ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with lillian . you know ? work it out with her , tell her how you feel . lilliangs not out to get you .
the hell she is not . lilliangs been trying to nail me to a cross since the day i met her . i am gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from concord and get this thing , this divorce thing , rearranged . i have been thinking about it a lot . it is like she owns jill or something . nobody owns nobody , especially not kids . and i pay her .
tonight . let s get together .
okay .
there s something funny about that shooting . there s lots funny about it , actually .
i heard he was drunk at toby s last night and got in a fight with hettie . he drove off without her . . .
i am sure , i am positive it did not happen the way jack says it did .
. . . jack s turned into one of those men who are permanently angry . he used to be a sweet kid , but it is like , when he found out he could not play ball anymore , he changed . now he is like everyone else .
i have been wondering if maybe jack shot twombley , instead of twombley shooting himself . i have been wondering maybe jack shot him on purpose .
wade ! how can you even think such a thing ? why would jack hewitt do that , shoot twombley on purpose ?
jack does not need money .
everybody needs money . except guys like twombley and that sonofabitch son in law of his . people like that .
jack would not kill for it . besides , who would pay him ?
lots of people . guy like evan twombley , boston union official , probably got lots of people want to see him dead . the government s been investigating his links with the mafia .
the mafia hire jack hewitt ?
no , i just know jack s lying about what happened . he just seemed i know that kid , what he is like inside . he is a lot like i was at his age .
you would not have done anything like that , shot someone for money .
no . not for money . but , if somebody would given me half a damned excuse i was pretty fucked up , you know .
but not now .
you knew me as a kid .
yeah , but never what you looked like . not really . never really studied your face , like now . i was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now , this way .
what way ?
after making love . i like it . it is nice to see that in a grown up person .
it is nice .
i am her father supposed to be , but i am not able to . yes . yes , i am . it may be the only thing in my life i have been so clear about wanting . even if it takes a big fight .
then . . . i guess you have to .
there s another thing i have been thinking about . i do not know how you feel about the idea , margie , because we have never talked about it . but i have been thinking lately , i have been thinking we should get married sometime . you and me .
oh , wade .
i have been thinking about it , that is all .
you have been married twice
it was to the same woman . i was just a kid . . . it is not like a marriage proposal or anything , just a thought . something for you and me to talk about and think about . you know ?
alright . i will think about it .
good .
do not you think it is proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents ?
i know your parents .
i just want to pick up my divorce papers . for the lawyer . it will not take long .
the truck s here . looks like they have stayed inside since the snow started .
think they are alright ?
of course ! i would have heard .
how ?
i do not know for christ s sake !
wade .
jesus christ , pop , let s go home . i got waylaid . sorry .
it is my tooth ! my fucking tooth ! i cannot even think anymore because of it .
i heard you talking . you got fired this morning , did not you ?
look , that is temporary , believe me . there s so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days , my getting fired by lariviere and merritt will not matter a bit .
i am just cleaning out some of this stuff that is built up . for the rummage sale . and some things for the cleaners . and the laundromat .
do not lie to me . you are leaving me , i can see that .
do not be silly . hi , jill .
there s a furnace .
you are not using it today ?
it is broke i guess . there s an electric in the bedroom .
maybe wade should take a look at it . your pipes will freeze . wade , would you do that ?
when did she die ?
is . . . ? she is dead then ?
can ?
makes me sad it was her . instead of me . i shoulda froze .
how is that ?
jesus christ . mr . gordon , when i come all the way to serve somebody a summons , i do not call ahead for an appointment .
what the hell are you talking about ?
i am issuing you a ticket . moving violation .
moving violation ! i just got out of bed and you are telling me you are giving me a goddamn speeding ticket ? now ? are you nuts ? is that it , whitehouse ? you are nuts ?
yesterday morning , you passed a stopped school bus , which was flashing its lights , then you
hold on !
do not ever put your hands on me , mr . gordon .
you are talking about a goddamned ticket , from when i passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something ?
do not give me a hard time , mr . gordon . i am just
doing your fucking job . i know . i watch television too .
yes . here s your ticket .
you get the hell out of my house now , asshole . and know this you are going to be a lucky asshole if i have not got you fired before the day is out . i can do it with one phone call , and i am pissed enough to do it now !
i was . . . i am wade whitehouse . i was wondering , is your husband here ?
he is asleep . we were up very late .
well , yes , i am . . . i want to say that i am real sorry about your father , mrs . twombley .
mrs . gordon . thank you .
well , yeah , i suppose . sure . i just had a little business to settle with mr . gordon . i am the local police officer .
something about my father ?
oh , no . no , it is a . . . it is a traffic thing . no big deal .
cannot it wait , then ?
you be careful of that little bastard . he is dying to get in your pants , you know .
what ?
the sign . it looks like it is spelled wrong or something .
fuck . wade whitehouse . it is people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering . whatever somebody does to improve things around here , you gotta find fault with it .
i am not finding fault . it is a good idea , good for you , good for the town . real modern too .
this town sucks .
aw , c mon , i was only saying there s something wrong with home made cooking , that is all . the signgs fine . what it says is wrong .
that goddamned woman . thinks she can cart jill off and leave me alone like this . i am more than pissed , margie . i am a whole lot more than pissed . i been that plenty and i know the difference . this is different .
marg ! you got orders !
not since last night . he took a guy hunting .
the fucker shot himself . ker bang ! that is what it sounds like . not on purpose . i assume accidental .
jack ?
the other guy .
where . . . how would you hear that ?
cb . little while ago . one of the boys on the way in picked up jack on the cb calling for state troopers . i figured you would know what really happened . the fucking guy kill himself ? this twombley , who the fuck is he , anyhow ?
no , i . . . i have been out on the grader all morning . twombley s summer people . massachusetts . friend of gordongs . it was his idea for jack to take him hunting . i gotta go .
it is called a grilled cheese sandwich , you dub .
his office . you mean my old office .
well , i guess that is what he said .
he got his deer yet ?
no , he is out now . somewhere on the mountain . i would stay away from him if i were you . he is real pissed .
a lesson in work and its rewards . you will thank me for this one day . sally , turn off that tv !
atta go .
nothing .
you no good pup !
sleeping .
you remember margie fogg ?
from wickham s . been a while . like some coffee ?
how you and ma doing ? have not seen you in town for a while .
we are alright . your ma s sleeping . you want me to get her ?
yeah .
she is coming .
i checked on her . she had the electric heater . cold do not bother her as much as me . which is why i give her the heater .
is there something wrong with the phone ?
in the living room .
why did not you call and have the furnace fixed ?
wade . i thought she was alright . till this morning she was .
come on , smart guy . tell how it is no big deal . tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that womangs head .
you think you can take me now ? come on , try .
you do not know me . you do not know me ! so fuck you . fuck you .
nah nah naw ! you done done finally done it ! like a man done it . done it right . i love you , you mean sonofabitch !
love ! i am made of love !
call it what you want .
everything you know is from me .
yeah .
bang !
you and me .
crawl !
nothing in the fucking house to drink . not a fucking thing . my house , my money , my truck stolen !
i do not know you . my goddamn father and i do not know you .
wade ?
yeah , brother , look , i was calling cause has there been anything on tv in boston about a hunting accident with a guy named twombley , evan twombley ?
there was something . it happened up your way .
yeah , i know him the kid that was with him . maybe you do too . jack hewitt . he works for lariviere with me . he is my best friend .
wade , it is late . i know you are probably at toby s , but i am in bed reading . we got different habits .
no , not tonight . i am in bed too . i am calling because i need you to listen . you are supposed to be a smart guy . you are a professor . i got this theory . jack says he did not see twombley shot but he did .
he was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in new england and the construction business .
who ?
twombley .
no shit .
you think jack shot him ?
well , it was an accident .
they were out deer hunting , right ? jack probably heard the gun go off , then came back and found the body .
huh ?
the night before the shooting .
how was she ?
picked up jill . she was supposed to visit for the weekend for halloween . she wanted to go home .
who ?
jill . i was thinking of getting a lawyer . maybe you can help me .
what happened ?
a divorce lawyer . a custody lawyer . you know , cause of jill .
yeah , i guess .
get some sleep .
i get to feeling like a whipped dog some days , rolfe , and some night i am going to bite back . i swear it .
have not you already done a bit of that ?
no , no , i have not . not really . i have growled a little , but i have not bit .
what about jill ? is lillian bringing her ?
no thanks . i do not drink .
yeah . i forgot .
what about her ?
well , do you still plan to get married ?
yeah . she will probably quit her job and stay out here with pop . we cannot leave him alone here , he will set the damn place on fire . with jill here a lot , it will be good to have margie around . things are going to change in that department , by the way . i got a custody lawyer in concord . i am gonna see him tomorrow . all hell s gonna break loose , but it is worth it .
anything new about the shooting ? twombley ?
i guess it was an accident , like everybody thinks .
want to know what i think happened ?
i think your first response to the twombley shooting was the correct one .
which is ?
that it was not an accident .
then who shot him ?
well , your friend , i think . jack hewitt .
motive . you gotta have a motive .
money .
who would pay him that kind of money ? not the mob . they got their own guys . specialists .
they would not deal with a guy like jack . who else benefits if twombley is suddenly dead ?
i do not know . you tell me .
okay . it is likely there are people in the union who do not want twombley to testify . they probably include his son in law who s vice president and will probably be the next president . i read that in the papers . that is his name , mel gordon ?
yeah , the guy with the bmw i told you about . i did , did not i ?
here s my theory . twombley , unaware of illegal union loans or whatever , starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out . finds out his son in law is involved .
so mel gordon would not want a professional hit . that would make the feds dig deeper . he wants an accident .
a hunting accident is perfect .
shit , around here , you shoot somebody in the woods , you say it was an accident , you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted . jack s probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ai not got his deer yet and do not want his license pulled .
not particularly .
right s right , goddamnit ! do not you care that is right ?
i care about what happened . the truth . i am a student of history , remember ?
yeah .
i hate to disappoint you , but i do not think it happened .
of course it happened . why would i lie about it ?
it may have happened , but not the way you said .
you think i would not remember a thing like that ?
it was not me . i was not there , but i heard about it . when i heard about it , it was about elbourne .
we would have to go digging in vietnam to ask him .
and elbourne and mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft .
well , i never heard that one .
i remember clearly cause when i heard i became real careful around pop . i was a careful child and i became a careful adult , but at least i was not afflicted by that mangs violence .
that is what you think .
wade , are you alright ?
but you gotta hear this . you will not believe it . mel gordon had come by to visit lariviere and so now i am in his office .
for what ?
take care of the little things first , the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things . call chub merritt , get your car back , call a dentist , for god s sake , and get your tooth pulled , do not trust the locals , get your facts straight and go straight to the state police . let them work on this .
well , you are not the president , dear .
yeah , no duh .
i am sure he is busy .
do not you even want to ask ?
alice . . .
mom , just this once , give it a rest .
you are jet lagged . we will talk about this back . . .
back at the fishbowl ?
i know , mom . it was great . . . really .
i am sorry , honey .
no , it is okay . after all , he is the president , right ?
your father never means to be so . . .
i know . . . but lotsa times i feel like it is me versus the world . some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in bangladesh . i mean it does not take a genius to figure which is more important .
some kids were teasing you ?
that is not really the point .
big secret . you said the same thing to newsweek .
yes dear ?
i am sorry i was so mean to you earlier .
jim . . . for godsake !
you must be tired . it will wake you up .
no , thank you . the gunfire did that .
so , you study world events , little one . that is good for a girl your age .
yeah , i study world events . five thousand turkienistan muslims were slaughtered in stravanvitch s cleansings . . . along with american school kids . you know hqw i studied that . i went to their funerals with my dad . i met their parents .
smart for your age , eh ? top of your class ? tell me , do you know what the word quot propaganda quot means ?
yeah . do you know what the word quot asshole quot means .
that is the way of the world , little one . did not they teach you that in school ?
it would be a pity to squander such a strong personality .
you are a resilient man , mr .
hey , you guys back already ?
it was the experience of a lifetime .
how bout a hug for the old man .
daddy . . .
alice . . . i . . .
been better , dad . . . you ?
it is okay , honey . i got you . i got you . you are okay .
okay , i am slowing us down .
did we warn them off ?
yes . they refused to alter course and the would not answer our hails .
they are in our airspace . we would be within our rights .
the world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner .
warn then again . if they do not respond . . . shoot them down . we will not be intimidated .
got it .
pop it open . there should be a red switch , toggle it up .
okay , it is on . we have got some indicator lights here .
okay , you are aerated . to dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump . there s no switch in avionics so you will have to cross the wires . there should be five wires , just to your left . do you see them ?
cross it . . . the static overwhelms the voice , then cuts out .
copy air force one . welcome to the party .
you read my mind .
put your pilot on .
he is busy being dead .
i am doing what i can .
okay . we are gonna arc a fat one to the right . got it ?
got it .
stay cool .
we still got three migs running around and six more on the way .
just stay on my wing , sir . i will take you all the way in .
no . we are losing fuel and my rudder s not responding .
lemme take a look .
sluggish . . . i think it is jammed too .
uh , tower , we got a problem up here .
we do not know that .
holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you are making demands .
that kid s name was jim marshall .
this does not make sense .
i prefered the terrorists .
that is game , set , and match . there s nothing to do , except call the chief justice .
goddamn right i did . i asked for a tough as nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit . that is the point in having a speech if i have to ad lib ?
it was a good ad lib , sir .
thanks . wrote it last night .
put together a score sheet . i will make some calls .
an exercise in futility . send the nimitz back in .
does your office have anything to add , mr . dean ?
we have got four hours before they make it into turkienistan airspace .
i hate to be pragmatic , but they will sacrifice pawns before kings . it may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff .
okay . also , i want you to put our bases in turkey on alert , and have the kitty hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike .
like any good poker player , they are checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard .
iraqi s will not buy it . either they are already in on this or they will think we are spying .
if fired upon , tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage .
to swear you in as president .
yes , mr . president .
why ?
because it is my duty .
you are duty to what ? the country you served does not exist anymore .
my loyalty was never to my country .
about goddamn time .
please change course to zero seven four and drop to eighteen thousand feet . over .
air force one , acknowledged . tnt . emergency parachute launch ramp .
roger .
ga get it .
sir , this plane carries the president of the united states .
dead .
how many others killed ?
nine .
any of us ?
we checked the manifest . everyone was accounted for .
a secret service agent . it must be .
why did they do that ?
psychology . they are trying to unnerve us .
well it worked .
avionics compartment ! it is the only place . you better get zedeck down there fast unless , of course , you would rather be a martyr than a savior .
go ! take serge . . and watch your backs .
we are not going to make it .
not even close . hell , we cannot even make syria or iraq .
where are we now ?
over the black sea . i can probably get us to turkey or georgia .
no ! if we land this plane anywhere else , we will end up another entebe . the americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud , evades missiles and . . . refuels in mid air . call the white house .
romeo tango zulu , copy one the television , graphics of the first family against the presidential seal .
stand by .
romeo tango zulu this is tower .
tower , here .
this is romeo tango zulu changing call signs . tower , alert air traffic , romeo tango zulu is now air force one . this is air force one . . . the president is safe onboard .
copy , air force one .
the president and i were delighted that we could accommodate you . now if you are all cleared ? you can follow me then .
this is a remarkable aircraft .
you do not know the half of it . did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation ? we could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary .
a dubious distinction , no ?
i guess it depends on your perspective .
conference rooms , though some have other functions . the one up front doubles as an emergency medical center .
thank you .
maria . . . maria mitchell .
and what is it you do , ms . mitchell .
how are your fellow hostages feeling , ms . mitchell ?
scared . we are scared .
very good . thank you , ms . mitchell .
what do you want with us ?
cooperation . if you try to escape , you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade s bodies will prevent you from exiting . good day .
come on , alice .
or you will do what , mrs . marshall ? but i admire your courage . your husband , on the other hand . . .
what do you know of my husband ?
i know he left you behind .
my husband is a very courageous man .
your husband is a coward . he sends soldiers half way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night .
yes
why ? do you enjoy it ?
i neither enjoy nor dislike . i do what is necessary .
how can you ? i mean they are people .
that was war .
so is this . come now , you are upsetting the little one .
no .
say something dear .
you will be the first to pay for that mistake .
please . you can kill me but leave my daughter alone .
jim . . .
three . . .
you are very valuable . and our nation needs so many things .
over my dead body .
no . but since i only have a few of your staff left to kill , perhaps i will start with your family instead . . . gibbs .
call up petrov and order stravanavitch s release .
pity . mr . gibbs .
you will do it ?
yes , i will do it . just leave my family alone .
good . good .
you do not like seeing people get hurt . now in morality , that is a virtue . in politics , however , that is weakness . you were a hostage to everyone else long before you were a hostage to
one thing i have learned as
let my daughter go or i will take you out !
if you put down the gun , i promise not to drop her on the way down .
hold on , alice .
okay , gentlemen , we will take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane . . . lee , go huddle with the d . o . d . i want an options paper on this in minutes .
twenty minutes ?
you heard me . you . congress and cabinet heads .
yes . you have made yourself quite clear .
i am sure we can strike some sort of arrangement . land the plane and we will trade you hostages for fuel .
they have gotta be joking .
tell our boys to cool their jets . i do not need em creating policy for me .
gravity .
we cannot jump from here or at this speed . but if we could get a message out tell the refueling plane . . .
they have cut communication , and i spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives . my only solution ran out of batteries .
eighteen thousand feet , sir . and two hundred knots . . . otherwise it is suicide .
got it .
yes , sir .
that is not necessary .
cannot it wait ?
no , mr . president . it cannot .
rose , i do not have time for this .
she is a big girl . she understands .
how do you know she understands ? you have not spent more than five minutes with her , or me , in weeks .
and when have i had five minutes ? when i wake up in the morning and i am already three hours behind schedule . what do you want me to do , rose , tell the g to fuck off because i am a family man ?
what ?
i miss you . and i miss her .
but that is the point , jim . we are right here .
i wish it were that easy . . .
i should trust that promise ? because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut .
this promise is not subject to congressional approval .
well , they are not burning me in effigy . that is always a good sign .
shall i ask the chief of staff to schedule your daughter in ?
please . . . do not start with me .
both of you .
flying the plane .
you have not even driven a car since you took office .
excuse me ?
the fax machines .
no good . i said they disabled the communications system .
no . i thought about this , mr .
white house situation room .
actually , sir , you could be that someone .
they are still alive , but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes .
then tell me there s a rescue operation underway .
you know my policy . we do not negotiate with terrorists . if we start now , all of america becomes a target .
but this is different , sir . you are the president .
freeing stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed . i cannot live with that . i am not royalty . i am an elected official and the integrity of the office of the president is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office . we do not negotitate . not as long as i am president . is that understood ?
we are under attack .
where is my family ?
we are handling it , sir .
but . . .
two . . . three . go !
okay listen , listen carefully . this is an emergency call from air force one . who s there ? is the vice president there ?
who can i say is calling ?
this is the president .
yeah , right .
do not cut me off . this is an emergency .
sir , the president does not call this particular number . so whoever you are get a life , before i have this call traced .
you do not understand . this is an emergency . let me talk to anyone .
look lady , i do not have time for games . just put the . . . .
thank you for calling the white house . . .
no . no . no . wait . wait .
i always wondered if my freshman russian class would come in handy .
no , no . i am fine . what did the speaker say ?
he and the nra do not like the wording .
i might still have a few chips left .
we could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge . the second amendment types will love that .
this is a crime bill , shep . killing a couple ducks will not get it through committee . besides , shep , i told you . . . i do not shoot babies and i do not kiss guns .
other way around , sir .
right . . . christ i am tired . do me a favor and keep me away from the press .
sir , the speaker of the house attacked this administration on national television . you cannot afford to leave that hanging .
did we tape the duke game ?
we will just say it was in bad taste .
that is my job .
yes , sir .
okay . hey , pumpkin , you will tell me all about it later , right ?
i never left . where is my wife and daughter ?
sir . . .
a mig ? where the hell are we ?
iraq ? shep , you are fired .
how long s it been since you flew , sir ?
twenty five years .
they better . fuel s almost gone .
do you see teem ?
we are hooked . hove into position .
forget it . the boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule .
bud , get wise to the political realities . the boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown .
commissioner .
i just wish it was that simple .
that just does not make any sense .
i wonder how your boys in washington are going to take this one .
i told you , leave the boys in washington to the boys downtown and the boys down . . .
you have made your point , commissioner . there s only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that is clarence oveur . he is got a lunar flight today . i want him pulled . jacobs , pull oveur !
i was reading too .
that is the story ?
some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor . . .
i was asking mccrosky , commissioner .
commissioner , aquarius .
yes i did . . .
felt like a large asteroid .
yes it did . mr . dunn , can i ask you a personal question ?
what is it , mary ?
um . . . do you people scream right when you . . . you know .
dunn .
accelerators down .
you better check it , unger .
you better check on it , mr . dunn . i will stay here and fly the ship .
sir ?
you better take this .
te . . . !
that is not important now , elaine . we have to talk .
but , ted , the invitations have already gone out .
i mean the mercury flight . it is not safe and , kurtz , you know why .
ask simon .
there s nothing wrong with me !
let s relax tonight , just the two of us . i will make a quiet italian dinner just the way you like it , with spaghetti .
you are as bad as the rest of them , elaine ! it is all here in the design specifications ! look ! it is all here !
ted , please . you are just making things difficult for yourself .
ted , i loved you and i will always love you . but i need simon . he is stable . he is a good provider . i want that at this stage of the game , ted . he might have his faults , but simon does not know the meaning of the word fear and i need that in a man .
who s that , ted ?
sammy davis junior . terrible car accident . he has not been the same since .
and when are you going to realize , ted , that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now .
ted , you must remember what the doctor said , the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you are sick . now take your electro shock and you will be back at the space center in no time . and by the way , ted , i am leaving you for simon .
if that is the way you want it .
that is the way i want it . just turn the radio on and go .
goodbye , ted . i do not want to hurt you .
i have to get in there . i have to stop this flight .
let me by , elaine .
i have got it , elaine ! i have figured out that is wrong with the shuttle !
not now , elaine !
ted !
ted . i do not know why you got on this flight . i do not know what you are trying to prove .
elaine , we have to go back .
we cannot go back . we had something very special , but it is all over .
elaine , i mean the mission has to be aborted . this ship should never have passed fsa inspection . this thing is held together by string and chewing gum .
then you u do u think i am insane .
i have never used the word insane , ted .
what word would you use , elaine ?
the word is sick . ted very , very , very sick .
what would you say if i told you the toilet just blew up in my face .
i would use the word insane .
there s something dangerously wrong with this ship , elaine . i know its the wiring . that toilet s just the tip of the iceberg .
ted , a toilet s not going to kill anyone .
ted !
elaine , that is going on ?
ted , there s no time to explain .
ted , please be careful .
not now , elaine .
i mean until we start to burn up .
that was very well put , ted .
i just want you to know , i love you ted and always will .
that might be the news we have been waiting for .
sit down , elaine . if this bomb trick works we just might make it . simon was a fool to eject now .
you mean . . .
that is right premature ejection .
what will happen to him , ted ?
the sun will heat that thing to over degrees within seconds . he will roast like a pig on a spit .
not when i am with you , ted .
i guess you would have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this .
set !
now !
compute !
kramer , the worp control handle just came off in my hand .
the human brain is a highly complex organ , elaine , perhaps the most complex next to the bladder . let me show you . ted s problem is in this area . this area , this area , here , here , here , under here , here . . .
what can u i u do , doctor rumack ?
i mean for ted .
you can be gentle with him , elaine . he is been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden .
is that a good sign , doctor ?
is he making any progress , doctor ?
yes last week that pile of mud was only this high .
simon .
who would believe that elaine thompson was once a stewardess on the denver chicago run .
and i can hardly believe that i am engaged to someone like you , simon . i am a very lucky woman .
but , darling , they have offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the jupiter probe .
you are heading up the division in charge of babies for mr . and mrs . simon kurtz .
i am so excited , simon .
i guess this is a first for you .
no , i have been excited before .
simon , why has he become so . . . so . . .
so mentally ill ?
do not be too long .
i think so .
that is my girl .
roger .
he tried to disconnect rok . it gassed him . that computer is running this ship and we are heading right for the sun .
cannot we change course ?
we are computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down .
your career ! what about the lives of those people out there . simon , what happened to the man i thought i loved ?
maybe .
simon , what are you saying ? !
yes , sir .
i see . what do you think our alternatives are ?
we have to disconnect rok s higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system .
you can do it from up here , captain .
i would rather sit down for this one , elaine .
no , i mean you can do it from the cockpit .
roger . you better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit .
negative .
that does not make sense . repeat analysis .
negative .
that is not possible .
cut the doubting thomas shit , elaine . i know where i am coming from on this .
that is okay , rok .
can i say something of a personal nature to you ?
go ahead .
you have great tits .
systems check positive . look , elaine , i . . .
request life support systems check .
life support check . elaine , it is obvious you have been ignoring me . you are a woman . i can relate to that .
request self analysis of rok hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes .
there s nothing wrong with me , elaine . what about tonight just you and me . we can be alone . i can get rid of everyone else on the ship i have already proven u that u .
we will have to check , jimmy . it is a pretty long trip to mercury .
i bet scraps is going to love mercury .
do you think things will be a lot different on mercury , dad ?
it is going to be terrific . a whole new world , new kids to play with .
no more kids yelling , your old mangs a thieving rapist ?
look , a man can make an honest mistake ! ! anyway , she was asking for it ! they are all asking for it all the time ! !
scraps .
can i hold him ?
sure .
he is a boy dog .
yeah .
do you like it when scraps sleeps on his back , jimmy ?
we have spent everything on these operations . is it really worth it ? we have pawned your mother s wedding ring . the kids have no winter clothes . . .
joey , that is more important , the kids clothes or your sexual potency .
i do not want to hear that word !
okay , joey . the doc says you gotta relax . this hospital in des moines is the best sex clinic in the country .
all right . here .
what . . . ?
i do not want to live anymore .
joe , the insurance policy will not help your wife and kids . you bought auto insurance , not life insurance .
what ?
that is right , joe . now , no one s going to hurt you and no one has to know that is wrong with you .
you are sure ?
i am sure .
how would you like your eggs , captain ? over .
no . poached . over .
poached u and u over , captain oveur ? over .
just poached on toast . over .
all right , captain oveur . over .
poached ! not over ! over !
have you tried it with a little cinnamon ?
sixteen c , why ?
he is carrying a bomb .
a b . . .
what should i say ?
anything . just do not let salucci think we are onto him .
mr . kurtz , i presume .
we do not have much time . let s move . i will explain everything .
do you think it is necessary to explain u everything u ?
captain oveur , your navigator , mr . unger , and your first officer , mr . dunn .
yes , sir , commander . this is mercury one . everything seems a okay up here and ready for count down .
thanks , but we have a terrific woman in on thursdays .
say , is not that dr . barrington , the world renowned agronomist ?
yes .
it is a privilege to meet you , sir , i am familiar with all your work .
let s go , daddy . we have to check in . he was never appreciated at the institute .
ah , yes , the institute , i am familiar with it .
now he is d y i n ging and wants to be buried on mercury .
do you have an appointment , sir ?
no , dammit . it is a matter of life or death .
you will have to be more specific than that , sir .
all right , it is a matter of death .
death , death . how about the first thursday in march , ten o clock .
do not try to stop me !
but that is not a door . the door s over there .
that is right , striker . and we are getting married when we return .
look at this wiring . it is shorting out under high temperatures .
you are tired , striker , overworked . that wiring meets all the safety specifications .
i know you have been subtly spreading the word that i am having a breakdown .
kurtz , you are drunk . who s in command of this ship ?
that damn computer has taken over . i am getting out .
then elaine was right .
do not talk to me about elaine . outta my way !
pull yourself together ! we have got to . . .
uh . . . oh , thank you . it is nothing .
you do not have to thank me , i am a nurse . this is my father , dr . barrington .
not dr . barrington , the world renowned agronomist ?
yes . he is dying u a n d u wants to be buried on mercury .
i am familiar with your work , doctor . you will have to excuse me , i have to go .
you do not have to excuse yourself . i am a nurse . i understand .
i am getting over it . if a relationship is not working , you cannot force it .
no , i mean your head . sit down . i will take a look at it . i am a nurse .
i opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me .
no . i mean your relationship .
we were in love but i am not sure i know what love is anymore .
love s the same as it always was . it is people who change .
people change in relation to each other . love changes on its own .
not if the people change together in relation to that love .
sure . but that is only when the love itself goes unchanged .
then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there s change in the two people who share that love .
i just wish it was that simple . we really were in love . you know how it is when you laugh all the time .
well , we laughed . we laughed all the time .
that is very nice of you . thank you .
thank you . cream ?
no , thank you . i take it black . like my men .
were you vacationing in los angeles ?
well , it really was not a vacation . you see , i am a teacher in the new york city school system , and i was attending a seminar on visual aids to education . are you from l . a . ?
no . i am from washington , d . c . i am a lobbyist for the small businessmengs assocation .
well , after a thing like that you would not be expected to .
but i think it is time we stopped talking about me . a woman like you why have not you ever married ?
well , i am afraid that is a question that is all too easy to answer .
i know the answer career . a smart woman like you became so involved in your work , you did not have time for marriage .
i wish i could fool myself into believing that that is the reason . the truth of the matter is , nobody ever asked me .
you know , here we are having coffee together , and discussing education and business and economy . . . and we do not even know each other s names . . . full names i mean .
mine s eleanor . eleanor schiff .
that is a lovely name . mine s milton . . . milt ettenhenim . but my friends call me bubbles .
no . i am all alone .
just in case i do not have a chance to say goodbye , i want you to know that i have not spent so many pleasant hours for many years .
that is a very nice compliment , and i would like to say that . . . you have done the same for me .
oh , yes . come in , paul . rex will be right out .
well , to tell the truth , they really did not fill me in on many of the details . just told me to pick up captain kramer .
something about a plane with no pilot ?
shep , no ! i will bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there .
shep , no ! he gets so excited when new people are here .
can you fly this airplane and land it ?
surely you cannot be serious .
i u am u serious , and do not call me shirley ! what flying experience have you had ?
well , i flew single engine fighters in the air force , but this plane has four engines . it is an entirely different kind of flying . . . u all u u together u ! ! !
let s see . those are the flaps , that is the thrust , this must turn on the landing lights .
chicago , the passengers are beginning to panic . when do we start down ?
yes , everything they have got . how are the passengers doing ?
i will not deceive you , mister striker . we are running out of time .
surely there must be something you can do .
i am doing everything i can ! and stop calling me shirley !
and the last thing he said to me , doc , he said , sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys , tell them to go out there with all they have got and win just one for the zipper . i do not know where i will be then , doc , he said , but i will not smell too good . that is for sure .
excuse me , doc , i have got a plane to land .
i cannot tell .
well . . . not for another two hours .
you cannot take a guess for another two hours ?
no , i mean we cannot u land u for another two hours . fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains . we have got to go through to chicago !
i am not sure . i have not seen anything like this since the lina wertmuller film festival .
that is right .
we have some passengers who are very sick . could you come and take a look at them ?
yes . yes , of course .
a hospital ? what is it ?
it is a big building with patients . but that is not important right now . tell the captain i must speak to him .
certainly .
well , we had a choice . steak or fish .
yes , yes , i remember . i had lasagna .
he had fish .
let s see now . the co pilot had fish . what did the navigator eat ?
he had fish , too .
extremely serious . it starts with a slight fever .
no .
all right . unless i can get all these people to a hospital quickly , i cannot even be sure of saving their lives . now , is there anyone else on board who can land this plane ?
well . . .
i think you ought to know what our chances are . the life of everyone on board depends on just one thing finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane , but who did not have fish for dinner .
ted !
i came home early and found your note . i guess you meant for me to read it later . elaine , i have got to talk to you .
i just do not want to go over it any more .
i know things have not been right for a long time , but it will be different . if you will just be patient , i can work things out .
i have been patient and i have tried to help , but you would not even let me do that .
do not you feel anything for me at all any more ?
it takes so many things to make love last . most of all it takes respect . and i cannot live with a man i do not respect !
i will not be back . i have requested the atlanta run .
elaine , not yet . i promise you i really can change .
then why do not you take the job that louie netz offered you at boeing ?
your u war u u record u ? you are the only one keeping that alive . for everyone else it is ancient history .
you expect me to believe that ?
but if you will just give me . . .
it is too late , ted . when i get back to chicago , i am going to start my life all over again . i am sorry .
elaine , i have got to talk to you .
you . . . you should not have come . i do not have time now .
my orders came through . my squadron ships out tomorrow . i will be leading a very important mission .
oh , ted , please be careful . i worry about you so much .
i love you , elaine .
i love you .
i remember everything . all i have are memories .
that is the way i have always wanted it to be , elaine .
but it will not be . not as long as you insist on living in the past !
headquarters ! ? what is it ?
it is a big building where the generals meet . but that is not important right now . they have cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid . is not that good news ?
seven . lieutenant zipp died this morning . ted , doctor sandler says you will be out in a week . is not that wonderful ?
be patient , ted . no one expects you to get over this immediately .
that is lieutennt hurwitz . severe shell shock . he thinks he is ethel merman .
ted , i do not want to stay here . it is time for us to go back home to the plans we made before the war .
a lot of people made plans before the war . like george zipp .
that is what i have been trying to tell these people .
and a little ice .
and a little ice !
sluggish . like a wet sponge .
it is a damn good thing you do not know how much he hates your guts .
what happened , ted ? what went wrong ?
oil pressure . i forgot to check the oil pressure . when kramer hears about this , the shit is gonna hit the fan .
i do not care . i just do not have what it takes . they would be better off with someone who would never flown before .
yes ?
i wanted you to know now i am very proud .
tell them the gear is down and we are ready to land .
the gear is down .
uh huh .
hello .
joey can stay up here for a while if he would like to .
who wants to be first ?
i think so , but i have never seen it so acute .
find out if there s a doctor on board , as quietly as you can .
you promise you will write .
every day .
oh , bill , i will keep it . i will keep it with me all the time .
so long , darling . good bye . take care of yourself .
bill ! bill ! good bye , bill .
good bye , darling .
good bye , darling . i love you . i love you , darling .
good bye , darling .
yes , captain ?
did you decide on a runway yet ?
runway niner . it is the longest , and directly into the wind .
you are now eight miles from the airport . turn right to a heading of zero eight niner , throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet .
watch your altitude , striker . it is too erratic . you cannot come straight in . you have got enough fuel left for two hours flying . you have got to stay up there til we get a break in the weather .
all right , he is on final now ! put out all runway lights except niner .
yeah , i think he is . hey , fred !
well , it was not all that i had hoped .
what is it ?
oh jack , i am so warm . i am burning up .
here .
i am sorry , son , but you must have me confused with someone else . my name is roger murdock . i am the co pilot .
i think you should go back to your seat now , joey . right , clarence ?
i think you are the greatest . but my dad says you do not work hard enough on defense .
denver control , this is flight two zero niner intersecting victor airway seven niner niner .
. . . and that lots of times you do not even run down court .
we are turning left to a heading of zero niner niner .
. . . and that you do not really try , except during the playoffs .
the hell i do not ! i am out there busting my buns every night .
i am randy .
i am lisa . oh , you have a guitar !
i thought maybe you would like to hear a song .
oh , i would love to .
okay , this is one of my favorites .
i will , but jim will not .
oh , stewardess . my husband is very sick . can you do something , please ?
well , the doctor will be with you in just a moment . one thing do you know what he had for dinner ?
yes , of course . we both had fish . why ?
oh , it is nothing to be alarmed about . we will get back to you very quickly .
hi , roger . good to have you aboard . victor , this is roger murdock .
huh ?
huh ?
roger , roger . that is our vector , victor ?
no , why do not you take care ot it ?
all right . but just remember , my name is roger murdock .
yes ?
there s a little girl on board who s ill and . . .
oh yes , i saw . poor child .
could i borrow your guitar ? i thought i might be able to cheer her up .
of course .
thank you .
oh i have not flown for a long time .
no . no thank you .
the cockpit ? what is it ?
it is the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit . but that is not important right now . the first officer is ill and the captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio . do you know anything about planes ?
would you go up , please ?
thank you , randy . you better leave sweetheart . you might get hurt in here .
does that cost extra or you throw them in ?
you have got me all wrong . i do not charge money for something that i myself find pleasurable . . .
the girl out front mentioned strader s assistant , somebody named watson . maybe he knows .
todd ? todd does not know either .
not unless i got real drunk and nobody told me about it later .
a virgin . i find that very arousing . . .
i think you are just a little scared now , about what you might find once the lights go out . a little scared . . . and a lot curious . maybe more than you want to admit . but does not that turn you on , that curiosity and fear , swirling together ? think of it as broadening your horizons .
i like my horizons narrow .
your voice is saying no , but your body is saying yes .
yeah . . .
that is right .
we are with the police department . this is sergeant sykes , and i am
ss ai k ss ? perfect .
the young woman at the front said you might know where he is .
she did , did she ? well , she was wrong . excuse me , i have to change .
show me .
jesus , sykes it is been less than ten hours . me and alterez are on it , okay ?
you do not have squat .
you ever try to make a case in slagtown ? the list of newcomer informants is about as long as the list of mexican war heroes . . .
i would like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid , fedorchuk . . . see how much surfing you would do .
lay off , asshole .
i may be an asshole , but at least i am a real detective , not some outer shit space thing .
yes . . .
i am sergeant sykes , and this is detective jetson , los angeles police department .
sergeant . . . detective . i was not aware there were any newcomers at the rank of detective yet .
you were partners with him on some slag uh , newcomer real estate thing .
that is right . he and i , along with seven or eight others . listen , gentlemen , i will be happy to assist you in any way i can unfortunately , at the moment , i am overdue at another function .
no , sergeant not history . . . eternity . . .
this is becoming a serious breach of security .
he did not recognize me .
it is his new partner that i am worried about .
this is getting out of hand . i want you to deal with it . immediately .
here ?
do it !
sergeant . . . i would like to thank you for what you are doing .
that is that ? look , jetson . get this straight in your head . we are not pals , we are not married , and we ai not gonna take long moonlight walks together . . . we are just partners . and do not call me sergeant . call me sykes . . . or matt if you have to .
i am george .
my true name is ss tangya t ssorentsa .
gesundheit . you do not mind if i stick to george , do you ?
that is exactly so . it is like your name . . . sykes . i am sure it does not bother you at all that it sounds like ss ai k ss , two words in my language which mean excrement and cranium .
his body was discovered three days ago , in an alley off of central avenue , near downtown .
with two bri sabot slugs in the chest .
through the chest . rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts .
nice signal , dickwad !
there was no wallet . . . but he was still wearing a watch and two rings .
the guys at the mini mart last night made a half assed stab at the money in the till but i do not think that is what they were there for . i think we got us a couple a executions on our hands , george . . .
the murder at the mini mart is not our case . the captain said
yes .
well , there s a thing about partners , about being somebody s partner . you do for each other . and other people s rules do not mean shit . it is the rules set up between the two of you , that is all that counts . understand ? okay . well , my friend and partner was shot last night and i am after the shitbag that did it . as my partner , i am asking you to respect me and help me find him .
nothing s wrong . i just want to get something straight . you agree that there s a good chance these two shootings are somehow related , right ?
possibly . good . well , would you be willing to accept the theory , george , that . . . possibly . . . by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other ? does that sound unreasonable to you ?
yes . . . no , it is not unreasonable . although i
great . well , i am sure glad that is settled , are not you ?
nothing .
nothing ?
should not we examine their personal effects ?
a rubber . a condom . you know . . . coney island whitefish ? men , human men , put them on their , uh penises to protect against having babies . you need this for anything ?
and that fits ?
well . . . yeah , it is rubber . it stretches .
and still it fits ?
how the hell do you know that ?
a large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us . my spouse s brother is one .
so the slag they are cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like hubley worked at a refinery . i would say that possible connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible . okay , next step i gotta go talk to the wife of the slag store owner blown away last night .
i believe i should interview the widow alone .
why the hell ? ! great , fine . you talk to the wife .
did you learn anything ?
a week ago two men came to see her husband . after they left , he was very frightened . she identified one of the men from a photo i showed her . it was hubley .
aw right . what about the other guy ?
she did not know him . but she said her son might .
did you talk to him ?
he has not been home since that day . but she told me where to find him .
we would like to ask you about a business associate of your , warren hubley .
why would i do what ?
agree to work with me ? you do not like me . . . you do not like any of us . you have nothing but contempt for us . and yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner . . .
my partner is dead ! because one of you bastards killed him then disappeared into a rathole down in slagtown , where he is home and dry , cause nobody sees nothing , nobody says nothing . . .
at the end of the bar .
uh , matthew . . .
back off , george .
but i .
i will handle it .
screw me ? that cannot be right .
your mother mates out of season .
that is very colorful . but see now i have got a problem . i do not seem to be getting much cooperation from you , porter . so i guess we are gonna have to take this little session down to my office , ya know ?
stay back ! i am okay .
from quarantine , when my people first arrived here . he and i were housed together .
how could a straight arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him ?
in the camps , we were lodged four to a room . the selection process was entirely random . we did not get to stay with our friends . . . or families . . .
yeah , sure . i knew that . . .
three months . we learn quickly . we adapt . it is our strength . . . what we were bred for , to adapt to hostile environments .
this is mole . it is good .
i will bet . would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two ?
our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked .
ss loka . it means literally small but intelligent creature . it loses much in the translation .
and what was that one about my mother ? that was a good one .
ss trokya ss lato na .
yeah , that is it . say it slow .
todd watson . the assistant manager .
when will strader return ?
through his ass . next time you see him , tell him to call me . . . unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes .
my wife ? she worries about me .
you are married ?
was . divorced .
we mate for life . divorce . . . is a strange concept to us .
it is like having an eleventh finger removed . it hurts like hell , but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place .
i appreciate your honesty , george .
maybe not . . . i do not know . i am not sure i am gonna go . she does not need her burn out of a father there . . .
in the other mangs rectum .
sticking out of his ass . . . yeah ! see , that is what makes it a joke . there s like a surprise , and your mind fills in the funny picture . here s this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it is a thermometer . nada , huh ?
ta ss trakyona . . .
no shit , holmes . you are only from another goddamn planet , for chrissakes .
you humans are very curious to us . you invite us to live among you , in an atmosphere of equality we have never known before . you lay before us a beautiful green world , full of freedoms and opportunities . . . you give us ownership of our lives for the first time . . . and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves to live by the rules . . . rules that are not made to keep one people subordinate to another , but rules that exist to preserve equality . you aspire to very high ideals here .
do not count on me , george . i never had any ideals .
yeah , go home . get some sleep . you do sleep , do not you ?
a man , a human , was wiring it to your car . i did not get a good look at him . i must call my wife . . .
george , she is not gonna divorce you . you mate for life , remember ?
she is very progressive . i am certain she is considering it .
to the . . . to the beach ?
come on , let s go , dude . surf s up !
why ?
please , i must get out here .
come on , you will not have to get near the water .
stop the car !
thank you .
nothing .
warren hubley was in middle management at a refinery . . . joshua strader operated a successful bar and nightclub . . .
. . . and porter ran a piece of shit mom and pop mini mart . so what the hell s the connection ?
you must leave me alone on this .
no . i cannot involve you . this is not your concern .
the hell it is not , when somebody wires up enough c explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist ! that slag was on something , and not sour milk , either ? am i right ? tell me ! what is it ?
. . . it is called ss jabroka . to us it is a potent narcotic .
how potent ?
like your cocaine , i suppose . the high lasts several hours . we would receive small amounts of it . . . as a reward for our labor .
we ? you have taken it ?
we all did .
where did he get it ? was there any of it on the ship ?
no . . . i am sure not . that is why i am so concerned . . . someone must now be producing it here . but none of my people know how to make it . the process was carefully guarded .
jesus , this is major . why did not you tell me sooner ? why would you hold out on me ?
your people do not know about this part of out past . and they cannot know it would threaten our entire existence here .
i must trust you , matthew . i cannot stop this without you .
harcourt was the brain who brought it all together .
if the drug is here , we must destroy it .
no , george you are missing the point . the drug is evidence . we need to have the evidence , ya know ?
where is the drug ? where have they taken it ?
stay out of this , matthew . tell me where the drug has been taken or i will crush your lungs against this wall .
the fifty kilos , matthew . i have to find it . i cannot let it get out on the street .
why ? that is the big goddamn deal ?
fuck procedure .
ss ai !
it would be for your own good . i think you would be better off with a partner who s a little more . . . by the book . . . . still , i gotta tell you , george , for a quiet guy , you are sure hell on wheels once you get going . i would kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective .
there ! go back . down that side street .
do what ? ! george ? !
. . . it is harcourt .
harcourt is dead .
no he is not . not if he overdosed on the drug . massive amounts trigger a . . . a change . your body functions seize up , you appear to be dead , but it is really a state of incubation . when you emerge you are . . .
tell me about it . . .
we cannot let him get away .
why the hell are you so dead set against back up ?
because . . . because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming .
but there s no more drug .
you understand that . but how many others will ?
you look very good .
what is it ?
casull . magnum . you are talking twice the impact energy of . magnum hot loads .
only holds five .
yeah , the shells are too big for six in an cylinder . hell , matt , you do not need but one .
no . . . two .
well , one of the men did not like him so much . . .
we think he could a been involved , yeah . you know him ?
to be honest , it is hard to say . i hate to admit it but they all still kinda look alike to me .
who else can i ask around here ?
wait . you know who it looks like ? yeah . anderson . uh . . . james anderson . he is not in today . he took the afternoon off .
i think you are gonna find he is taken the rest of his life off .
yes it is . thirty five percent pure methane gas in there . i do not know how these fellas do it .
. . . they took the stuff out , all of it this afternoon .
try joshua strader , will ya , darling ?
for you , anything .
yeah we met him . wonderful boy . . . close personal friend of george s here .
i am sorry , matt . nothing here seems to be matching up . . .
sure . just a minute .
ss kya ta .
that is that ?
yeah . . . i seen him around . high roller dude named strader . joshua strader . runs a club on the west side . encounters .
yeah , i heard of it .
that is all i know . you want anything more , you ask somebody else .
come on . you got nothing better to do , cushy county job like yours .
the human ?
yeah . . . he was one martin helder . white male , twenty seven . let s see . . . wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction , a couple for sale of a controlled substance . oh yeah , and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock .
fedorchuk could not find his ass with his hands in his back pockets .
yeah .
lucky for you , you got him in both of his . . . well , what we loosely refer to as . . . hearts .
lucky nothing . i had to empty my damn gun into him .
that is the way these people are . you do not hit both pumps you just piss them off .
yeah , i will bet .
you mean the blob ? they are finishing up now .
looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day .
did he find anything ?
captain . i would like to volunteer for duty with the new detective .
departmental policy .
you ?
granger and pitts have one hell of a caseload . . . and i would have thought with jetson here being the first newcomer plainclothes , and hubley s body being found over in the newcomer community . . .
do not tell me what to think .
it is .
put on your wash and wear suit and your clip on tie , have your landlady tie your shoes for you , and show up at the church . simple . me and carol are going .
what ?
hey , look we have known kristin since . . . since she was conceived in that cabin up in big bear . remember ? you and edie banged the wall so hard , me and carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week . . .
goddammit , tug i want to see kristin get married , okay ? but
but you are bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing .
shit , if kristin had to get married where i could afford it , we would be holding the reception at buddy s burgers .
whatever gave you that idea ?
of course . right in the trunk of the car .
yeah , that is comforting . mine , too .
i got him . do not get pinned .
i cannot ! do you mind !
i will cover you ! get outta there ! !
christ . i never saw such a buncha old women . you want me to fetch your slippers , hudson ?
would you , sir ?
let s go . . . let s go . cycle through !
rescue mission . there s some juicy colonists daughters we gotta rescue from virginity .
position ?
cannot lock up . . .
talk to me , hudson .
uh , seems to be in front and behind .
awright . fire team a . gear up . let s move . two minutes . somebody wake up hicks .
awright ! i want a nice clean dispersal this time .
ten seconds , people . look sharp !
vasquez , take point . let s move .
let s go . pull em out .
say again ? all after incinerators ?
now let me get this straight . the aliens paralyzed the colonists , carried them over there , cocooned them to be hosts for more of those . . .
yes . that follows .
but these things come from eggs . . . so where are all the eggs coming from .
that is the question of the hour . we could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization . an ant of termite colony , for example , is ruled by a single female , a queen , which is the source of new eggs .
you are saying one of those things lays all the eggs ?
well , the queen is always physically larger then the others . a termite queengs abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it cannot move at all . it is fed and tended by drone workers , defended by the warriors . she is the center of their lives , quite literally the mother of their society .
could it be intelligent ?
hard to say . it may have been blind instinct . . . attraction to the heat of whatever . . . but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we could not destroy her without destroying ourselves . that is if she exists , of course .
how long until it blows ?
i am projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours . the blast radius will be about thirty kilometers . about equal to ten megatons .
i am afraid so . the crash did too much damage . the overload is inevitable , at this point .
what ?
i am really the only one qualified to remote pilot the ship anyway . believe me , i would prefer not to . i may be synthetic but i am not stupid .
all right . let s get on it . what will you need ?
see you soon .
plenty ! twenty six minutes !
we are not leaving !
she is alive . they brought her here and you know it .
in seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of nebraska .
well , thanks , i
you would drifted right through the core systems . it is blind luck that deep salvage team caught you when they . . . are you all right ?
well , i was going to wait until after the inquest . . .
amanda ripley mcclaren . married name , i guess . age sixty six . . . at time of death . two years ago . i am sorry .
cancer . hmmmm . they still have not licked that one . cremated . interred parkside repository , little chute , wisconsin . no children .
look , i believe you , but there are going to be some heavyweights in there . you got feds , you got interstellar commerce commission , you got colonial administration , insurance company guys . . .
i get the picture .
just tell them what happened . the important thing is to stay cool and unemotional .
they had their minds made up before i even went in there . they think i am a head case .
you are a head case . have a donut .
hear me out . . .
i was reamed , steamed and dry cleaned by you guys . . . and now you want me to go back out there ? forget it .
well , the corporation co financed that colony with the colonial administration , against mineral rights . we are getting into a lot of terraforming . . . building better worlds .
i heard you were working in the cargo docks .
that is right .
running loaders , forklifts , that sort of thing ?
it is all i could get . anyway , it keeps my mind off of . . . everything . days off are worse .
what if i said i could get you reinstated as a flight officer ? and that the company has agreed to pick up your contract ?
if i go .
if you go . it is a second chance , kiddo . and it will be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it . you gotta get back on the horse . . .
spare me , burke . i have had my psych evaluation this month .
no ! the answer is no . now please go . i am sorry . just go , would you .
burke , just tell me one thing . that you are going out there to kill them . not study . not bring back . just burn them out . . . clean . . . forever .
that is the plan . my word on it .
well , it did not occur to me . it is been policy for years to have a synthetic on board .
i suggest you study the disks ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you .
uh hunh . one of thirty or so , all over the planet . they are completely automated . we manufacture them , by the way .
yeah ? maybe the organisms like the heat , that is why they built . . .
that is not what i mean . gorman , if your men have to use their weapons in there , they will rupture the cooling system .
she is right .
now hold on a second . i am not authorizing that action .
why not ?
they can bill me . i got a tab running . that is second ?
this is clearly an important species we are dealing with here . we cannot just arbitrarily exterminate them
bullshit !
do not make me pull rank , ripley .
what rank ? i believe corporal hicks has authority here .
corporal hicks ! ?
this operation is under military jurisdiction and hicks is next in chain of command . right ?
you just try getting a dangerous organism past icc quarantine . section of the commerce code .
you have been doing your homework . look , they cannot impound it if they do not know about it .
but they will know about it , burke . from me . just like they will know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty seven colonists here
now , wait a second
you sent them to that ship . i just checked the colony log . . . directive dates six twelve seventy nine . signed burke , carter j .
look , maybe the thing did not even exist , right ? and if i would made it a major security situation , the administration would have stepped in . then no exclusive rights , nothing .
sorry to disappoint you .
you would not be going in with the troops . i can guarantee your safety .
these colonial marines are some tough hombres , and they are packing state of the art firepower . nothing they cannot handle . . . right , lieutenant ?
we are trained to deal with these kinds of situations .
dead on all channels .
it is insured .
pdt s . personal data transmitters . every adult colonist had one surgically implanted .
shit . apone , collect magazines from everybody . we cannot have any firing in there .
thirty eight . . . simulated .
the structure seems intact . they have power .
apone . . . where are your people ? anybody in d block ?
gorman ! give it a rest would you .
i do not know .
proceed inside .
so . . . then the fusion containment shuts down .
so ? so ?
shut up . just shut up !
they are but off ! do something !
all right , i guess . one hell of a hangover . look , ripley . . . i . . .
forget it .
sir ?
yes , hicks ?
hudson , sir . he is hicks .
that is the question ?
is this going to be a stand up fight , sir , on another bug hunt ?
all we know is that there s still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved .
how do i get out of this chicken shit outfit ?
. . . we are coming in .
he is coming in . i feel safer already .
okay , stand by in operations . let s go .
alive ?
unknown . but , it looks like all of them . over at the processing station . . . sublevel c under the south tower .
you tell me . i only work here .
sure , hicks .
not that tunnel , the other one !
are you finished ? you okay ?
aye firmative .
i do not fucking believe this . do you believe this ?
i want you two walking the perimeter . i know we are all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert . we have got to stop any entries before they get out of hand .
do it !
let s get these things lit .
six meters . five . what the fu
fucking a !
poor bastard .
about seventeen days .
we gotta figure on them getting into the complex .
that is right . so we put up welded barricades at these intersections . . . . . . and seal these ducts here and here . then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units , here .
on my way .
cannot tell . lots . d gungs down to twenty . ten . it is out .
but they do not know that . they are probably looking for other ways to get in . that will take them awhile .
maybe . maybe not .
hicks , i am not going to wind up like those others . you will take care of it will not you , it if comes to that ?
if it comes to that , i will do us both . let s see that it does not here , i would like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine .
well , that is the grenade launcher . . . you probably do not want to mess with that .
look , you started this . now show me everything . i can handle myself .
yeah . i have noticed .
the only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back . then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked .
let s waste him . no offense .
get back here , both of you . fall back to operations .
we did not miss anything .
stand back .
all right ! she is alive . i believe it . but we gotta get moving ! now !
we ai not going anywhere .
do not be long , ellen .
no . have you ?
fuck you .
anytime . anywhere .
look , man , let s just bug out and call it even , okay ?
maybe you have not been keeping up on current events , but we just got out asses kicked , pal !
hudson , give us a break .
you are just reading me .
no . no ! it ai not you . they are inside . inside the perimeter . they are in here .
the embryo , the second form , hosts in the victim s body for several hours . gestating . then it . . . . . . then it . . . emerges . moults . grows rapidly
hey . . . hey ! look , crowe and dietrich are not dead , man .
oh , god . jesus . this ai not happening .
she survived longer than that with no weapons and no training .
yeah , right , it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here .
uh , that is next ?
how ? the transmitter was on the apc . it is wasted .
i do not care how ! think of a way . think of something .
think of what ? we are fucked .
what about the colony transmitter ? that up link tower down at the other end . why cannot we use that ?
oh , right ! right ! with those things running around . no way .
what do you mean , they cut the power ? how could they cut the power , man ? they are animals .
just get back here !
seal the door .
i do not know , an acid hole in a duct . something under the floors , not on the plans . i do not know !
they are right on us . vasquez , how you doing ?
cannot be . that is inside the room !
it is reading right . look !
yeah . what ?
there s a guy on the horn , mom and pop survey team . says he is homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored .
christ . some honch in a cushy office on earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere , we look . they do not say why , and i do not ask . i do not ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer s always wouldo not ask .
so what do i tell this guy ?
tell him , as far as i am concerned , he finds something it is his .
terrible .
just terrible ? that is better than yesterday at least .
how long have i been on gateway station ?
just a couple of days . do you feel up to a visitor ?
no . . i have slept enough .
newt . my n name s newt . nobody calls me rebecca except my dork brother .
what about me ?
why not ?
because you will be gone soon , like the others . like everybody . you will be dead and you will leave me alone .
they are dead .
newt . look at me . . . newt . i will not leave you . i promise .
you promise ?
cross my heart .
and hope to die ?
the maze ? you mean the air ducts ?
yeah , you know . in the walls , under the floor . i was the ace . i could hide better than anybody .
you are really something , ace .
i am sorry , newt .
you do not have to be sorry . it was not your fault .
i do not want to . . . i have scary dreams .
oh . sorry , newt .
my mommy always said there were no monsters . no real ones . but there are .
why do they tell little kids that ?
did one of those things grow inside her ?
is not that how babies come ? i mean people babies . . . they grow inside you ?
no , it is different , honey .
did you ever have a baby ?
yes . a little girl .
where is she ?
gone .
you mean dead .
i will be right in the other room , newt . and look . . . i can see you on that camera right up there .
wah . . . ? where are . . . ?
sssh . do not move . we are in trouble .
i know , honey . me too .
look !
do you know how to get to the landing field from here ?
sure . go left .
newt , wait !
newt , i want you to hang on , now . hang on tight .
right here , baby . right here .
that is right .
can we dream ?
yes , honey . i think we both can .
it did not , however , contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up .
that is because i blew it out the goddamn airlock ! like i said .
thank you , officer ripley . that will be . . .
. . . because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew , within twelve hours of hatching . . .
because i do not have to . the people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and hostile organism or alien ship . and by the way , they call it acheron now .
what are you talking about . what people ?
sixty , maybe seventy families .
sweet jesus .
then that would be eating and drinking i would live like a prince without thinking . the wisdom of old would be mine a womangs much better than wine ! then that would be eating and drinking ! the wisdom of old would be mine a womangs much better than wine . she is much better than wine ! she is much better than wine !
a sweetheart or a pretty little wife is papageno s wish . a willing , billing , lovey dovey would be my most tasty little dish .
i need to net one birdie only and i will stop feeling so lonely . but if she will not fly to my aid , then into a ghost i must fade . i need to net one birdie only but if she will not fly to my aid , then into a ghost i must fade . to a ghost i must fade ! to a ghost i must fade !
a sweetheart or a pretty little wife is papageno s wish . a willing , billing , lovey dovey would be my most tasty little dish .
at present the girls only peck me . their cruelty surely will wreck me . but one little beak in my own , and i will up to heaven be flown ! at present the girls only peck me . but one little beak in my own , and i will up to heaven be flown . up to heaven be flown ! up to heaven be flown !
certainly !
indeed .
these viennese certainly know good music when they hear it .
his grace is very angry with you .
what do you mean ?
good morning .
well ? how do you like it ? it is turkish . my hairdresser tells me everything s going to be turkish this year !
really ? what else did he tell you today ? give me some gossip .
well , i heard you met herr mozart .
oh ? news travels fast in vienna .
and he is been commissioned to write an opera . is it true ?
yes .
is there a part for me ?
no .
how do you know ?
well even if there is , i do not think you want to get involved with this one .
why not ?
well , do you know where it is set , my dear ?
where ?
in a harem .
that is that ?
a brothel .
oh !
a turkish brothel .
turkish ? oh , if it is turkish , that is different . i want to be in it .
my dear , it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout vienna as a singing prostitute for a turk .
perhaps .
you might be disappointed .
why ?
looks and talent do not always go together , katherina .
looks do not concern me , maestro . only talent interests a woman of taste .
what ?
the marriage !
well , what does it matter to you ?
nothing ! he can marry who he pleases . i do not give a damn .
you were sublime .
what did you think of the music ?
extremely clever .
meaning you did not like it .
do not bother !
what ?
do not bother .
i will be right back .
is her mother still lying on the floor ?
no , she is fine .
i am so relieved .
what ? ?
i assume she is the virtuoso in that department . there cannot be any other reason you would marry someone like that .
excuse us , fraulein . good night , signore .
but he needs to be here in salzburg , your grace . he needs me and he needs you . your protection , your understanding .
hardly .
oh sir , yes ! he is about to make the worst mistake of his life . some little viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage . i know my son . he is too simple to see the trap and there is no one there who really cares for him .
i am not surprised . money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship . he has sold himself to vienna . let vienna look out for him .
sir
your son is an unprincipled , spoiled , conceited brat .
yes , sir , that is the truth . but do not blame him . the fault is mine . i was too indulgent with him . but not again . never again , i promise ! i implore you let me bring him back here . i will make him give his word to serve you faithfully .
and how will you make him keep it ?
oh , sir , he is never disobeyed me in anything . please , your grace , give him one more chance .
you have leave to try .
oh , your grace i thank your grace ! i thank you !
why do i have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants ?
humiliated ?
how much provocation am i to endure from you ? the more license i allow you , the more you take .
i wish you to return immediately to salzburg . your father is waiting for you there patiently . i will speak to you further when i come .
no , your grace ! i mean with all humility , no . i would rather you dismissed me . it is obvious i do not satisfy .
then try harder , mozart . i have no intention of dismissing you . you will remain in my service and learn your place . go now .
who the devil are you ? what do you want ?
i have come to dinnnnnner !
dinner ? how dare you ? i am a nobleman . i only dine with people of my own height .
are you drunk ? you invited me . and my horse . here he is . ottavio !
oh shut up . i am sick to death of that tune .
i want to go !
where ?
i want to go back to vienna .
now ?
yes !
why ?
i feel wrong . i feel wrong being here .
what are you talking about ?
i am ! i am ! i am stopping it slowly . you see ! look , i have stopped . now we are going back .
yes ! back ! back ! listen do not you know where you are ?
where ?
we are in the residence of the fartsbishop of salzburg .
fartsbishop !
go ahead , tell him . tell them all . they will not understand you anyway .
why not ?
because here everything goes backwards . people walk backwards , dance backwards , sing backwards , and talk backwards .
that is stupid .
why ? people fart backwards .
do you think that is funny ?
yes , i think it is brilliant . you have been doing it for years .
sra i am sick ! sra i am sick !
yes , you are . you are very sick .
no , no . say it backwards , shit wit . sra i am sick say it backwards !
sra i am sick . sick kiss i am my kiss my ! sra i am sick kiss my arse !
em iram ! em iram !
no , i am not playing this game .
no , this is serious . say it backwards .
no !
just say it you will see . it is very serious . em iram ! em iram !
iram marry em marry me ! no , no ! you are a fiend . i am not going to marry a fiend . a dirty fiend at that .
ui vol i tub !
tub but i tub but i vol love but i love ui you . i love you !
what ?
tish i am tee .
eat
yes .
eat my ah !
of course .
oh , leave me alone .
one royal pupil and the whole of vienna will come flocking . we would be set up for life !
they will come anyway . they love me here .
no , they will not . i know how things work in this city .
oh yes ? you always know everything .
well , i am not borrowing any more money from my mother , and that is that !
you borrowed money from your mother ?
yes !
well , do not do that again !
how are we going to live , wolfi ? do you want me to go into the streets and beg ?
do not be stupid .
all they want to see is your work . that is wrong with that ?
shut up ! just shut up ! i do not need them .
this is not pride . it is sheer stupidity !
tell them to go away . i do not want to see anybody .
that is the matter with you ?
tell them to go !
sssh . what is it ? tell me .
no !
yes !
i love you ! i love you !
stop it , wolfi . i look dreadful . welcome to our house , herr mozart .
he is not herr mozart . call him papa .
tea ? who wants tea ? let s go out ! this calls for a feast . you do not want tea , papa . let s go dancing . papa loves parties , do not you ?
wolfi !
what ? how can you be so boring ? tea !
wolfi , i think your father s tired . i will cook us something here .
what does she want ?
i do not know .
well , ask her !
she will not talk to me . she says she has to speak to you .
oh , damn !
stanzi !
no , it is right he should hear . i am sick to death of it . we cannot do anything right for you , can we ?
wolfi .
yes , my love ?
these gentlemen are from salzburg .
salzburg . we were just talking about salzburg . if you have come from my friend the fartsbishop , you have arrived at just the right moment . because i have got good news for him . i am done with vienna . it is over , finished , done with ! done with ! done with !
wolfi ! your father is dead .
what ?
your father is dead .
i am talking about now . how much will you give him now ? down payment ?
why not ? half the house !
when ? we need money now . either he pays now , or you do not do it .
oh , stanzi .
i do not trust this man . and i did not like what he did with your opera . it was common .
well , you liked it , did not you ? monkey flunki punki .
half the house ! you will never see a penny . i want it here , in my hand .
stanzi manzi , i will put it in your hand !
shut up ! i will not let you put anything in my hand until i see some money .
no one .
i heard voices .
i am not telling you .
why not ?
you would think i was mad .
why ?
oh yes , sir . he is all right . and he is working on it very hard .
give me two more weeks . please .
i cannot write it !
why not ?
it is killing me .
please ! let me sit here . let me stay here with you . i promise i will not say all word . i will just be here , so you know no one s going to hurt you . please , please !
madame . how can i help you ?
that is right , your excellency . i have come on behalf of my hus band . i am i am bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment .
how charming . but why did he not come himself ?
he is terribly busy , sir .
i understand .
would it be too much trouble , sir , to ask you to look at them now ? while i wait .
i am afraid i am not at leisure this very moment . just leave them with me . i assure you they will be quite safe .
i i really cannot do that , your excellency . you see , he does not know i am here .
really ?
my husband is a proud man , sir . he would be furious if he knew i would come .
then he did not send you ?
no , sir . this is my own idea .
i see .
sir , we really need this job . we are desperate . my husband spends far more than he can ever earn . i do not mean he is lazy he is not at all he works all day long . it is just ! he is not practical . money simply slips through his fingers , it is really ridiculous , your excellency . i know you help musicians . you are famous for it . give him just this one post . we would be forever indebted !
do not keep calling me that . it puts me at such a distance . i was not born a court composer , you know . i am from a small town , just like your husband .
that is very tempting , but it is impossible , i am afraid . wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing . you see , they are all originals .
originals ?
yes .
yes , sir . he does not make copies .
oh yes . he is really proud of his work .
oh , thank you , sir !
tonight ?
alone .
what for ?
some service deserves service in return . no ?
what do you mean ?
is not it obvious ?
but ! i am a married woman !
then do not . it is up to you . not to be vague , that is the price .
what ?
should we stay here ? it is a charming room . i love these candlesticks . were they here earlier ? i did not notice them i suppose i was too nervous .
your husband is ill , ma am . he took sick . i brought him home .
why you ?
i was at hand .
well , thank you very much . you can go now .
he needs me , ma am .
no , he does not . and i do not want you here . just go , please .
he asked me to stay .
and i am asking you
no . i was assisting him . he asked me .
he is not going to work on this anymore . it is making him ill . please .
madame , i will respect his . he asked me to stay here .
ah . well . ah , i see you have got your manager with you . well , madame , how about half the receipts ?
not at all .
where is our friend ?
he is not in . but he is working on it . he said to tell you .
i hope so . i need it immediately .
leave him alone !
i am paying these people . do you realize that ?
he is doing his best .
i am paying people just to wait for you . it is ridiculous !
you know that is ridiculous ? your libretto , that is that is ridiculous . only an idiot would ask wolfi to work on that stuff !
oh yes ? and that is so intelligent about writing a requiem ?
money ! money !
you are mad ! she is mad , wolfi .
oh yes , and who are you ? he is worked for kings . for the emperor . who are you ?
oh , yes .
when , may i ask ?
in three months ! papa .
but you cannot take her without reference . it is unheard of !
well , this is none of your business . whoever sent you is going to pay , no ?
and what do you expect ? who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day ?
oh , now i am a bad housekeeper !
so you are ! the place is a pigsty all the time .
do you hear him ? do you ?
be careful !
adorable !
behold !
hey !
behold !
i am sorry , madame . it is not permitted .
do you know who i am ? this is my daughter . i am frau weber . we are favoured guests !
i am sorry , madame , but i have my orders .
call herr mozart ! you call herr mozart immediately ! this is insupportable !
young man , i am no stranger to theatres . i am no stranger to insolence !
gertrude !
you cannot be herr mozart !
gertrude !
it is such an honour for us to have you here , herr mozart . and for gertrude .
people who know say the girl s got talent . you must judge for yourself . if you think she stinks , say so .
michael , please ! i am sure you will find her most willing , herr mozart . she is really very excited . she is been preparing all morning .
michael !
yes . he is a little strange .
ah , now ! here she comes .
i would like a little wine , if you have it .
wine ?
who was your teacher ?
i was . but she quite outgrew the little i could show her .
thank you , madame . come on now courage . play me something you know .
you are cattivo , court composer . i want to meet this young man . chamberlain , arrange a pleasant welcome for him .
it is just a trifle , of course .
may i try it ?
majesty .
you do me too much honour , sire .
let s have some fun . bring in herr mozart , please . but slowly , slowly . i need a minute to practice .
ah ha !
finally ! such an immense joy . diletto straordinario !
well , there it is . now to business . young man , we are going to commission an opera from you . what do you say ?
excuse me , sire , but what do you think these could be ? being a foreigner , i would love to learn .
cattivo again , court composer . well , tell him , mozart . name us a german virtue .
your highness .
i am thinking about herr mozart . what is your view ?
yes ?
you already commissioned an opera from mozart .
and the result satisfies .
yes , of course . my concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism .
ah ha . favouritism . but i so want mozart .
i am sure there is a way , majesty . some kind of a little contest . i could perhaps put together a small committee , and i could see to it naturally that it will select according to your majesty s wishes .
you please me , court composer . a very clever idea .
sire .
well . there it is .
majesty , i did . believe me , it was a most agonizing . decision . but finally , i simply could not recommend herr mozart .
why not ?
well , sire , i made some inquiries in a routine way . i was curious to know why he had so few pupils . it is rather alarming .
oh ?
of course not .
i have to tell you , mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies .
really ?
as a matter of fact , one of my own pupils a very young singer told me she was er well !
yes ?
molested , majesty . twice , in the course of the same lesson .
it is not a question of liking , your majesty . your own law decrees it , i am afraid .
well , look at them .
no , no , please ! it is not a holy relic . you know we have met already ? in this very room . perhaps you will not remember it , you were only six years old . he was giving the most brilliant little concert here . as he got off the stool , he slipped and fell . my sister antoinette helped him up herself , and do you know what he did ? jumped straight into her arms and said , will you marry me , yes or no ?
the director of our opera . count orsini rosenberg .
oh sir , yes ! the honour is mine . absolutely .
really ? oh , grazie , signore ! sono commosso ! e un onore per mo eccezionale . compositore brilliante e famossissimo !
did we vote in the end for german or italian ?
because i have already found the most wonderful libretto !
it is actually quite amusing , majesty . it is set the whole thing is set in a in a
in a pasha s harem , majesty . a seraglio .
ah ha .
what ? on one hearing only ?
i think so , sire , yes .
yes , indeed .
and german ?
oh , yes . absolutely . german . unquestionably !
so then you like it ? you really like it , your majesty ?
of course i do . it is very good . of course now and then just now and then it gets a touch elaborate .
what do you mean , sire ?
well , i mean occasionally it seems to have , how shall one say ? how shall one say , director ?
my dear fellow , there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening . i think i am right in saying that , are not i , court composer ?
which few did you have in mind , majesty ?
enchanted , madame .
well well we have not quite received my father s consent , your majesty . not entirely . not altogether .
twenty six .
well , my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in vienna .
thank you , sire !
what is it ?
may i introduce my father ? he is on a short visit here and returning very soon to salzburg . he would so much like to kiss your hand . it would make his whole stay so memorable for him .
ah ! by all means .
yes , sire .
yet we hear you are making an opera from it . is this true ?
who told you this , majesty ?
it is not your place to ask questions . is it true ?
well , yes , i admit it is .
would you tell me why ?
well , majesty , it is only a comedy .
sire , i swear to your majesty , there s nothing like that in the story . i have taken out everything that could give offense . i hate politics .
i think you are rather innocent , my friend . in these dangerous times i cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece .
ah , love again .
but it is new , it is entirely new . it is so new , people will go mad for it . for example , i have a scene in the second act it starts as a duet , just a man and wife quarreling . suddenly the wife s scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly a very funny situation . duet turns into trio . then the husband s equally screaming valet comes in . trio turns into quartet . then a stupid old gardener quartet becomes quintet , and so on . on and on , sextet , septet , octet ! how long do you think i can sustain that ?
i have no idea .
guess ! guess , majesty . imagine the longest time such a thing could last , then double it .
well , six or seven minutes ! maybe eight !
twenty , sire ! how about twenty ? twenty minutes of continuous music . no recitatives .
you are passionate , mozart ! but you do not persuade .
sire , the whole opera is finished . do you know how much work went into it ?
i agree , majesty , but i am afraid it is not possible . the young man is still in the pay of the archbishop .
very small pay , i imagine . i am sure he could be tempted with the right offer . say , an opera in german for our national theatre .
in my opinion , it is time we had a piece in our own language , sir . plain german . for plain people .
well . there it is .
your majesty , herr mozart
yes , what about him ?
he is here .
ah ha . well . there it is . good .
i will .
am i not welcome ?
of course , welcome ! welcome ten thousand times . papa ! my papa !
is she not here ?
i do not know . stanzi ? stanzi !
oh , yes . oh , i mean no not exactly like this . i mean today just today , stanzi i remember now . she had to go yes ! she had to help her mother . yes , she is like that . her mother s a very sweet woman , you will see .
do not you have a maid ?
oh we could , if we wanted to , but stanzi will not hear of it . she wants to do everything herself .
how is your financial situation ?
it could not be better .
that is not what i hear .
what do you mean ? it is wonderful . really , it is it is marvelous ! people love me here .
they say you are in debt .
who ? who says that ? now that is a malicious lie !
how many pupils do you have ?
pupils ?
yes .
yes .
how many ?
i do not know . it is not important . i mean , i do not want pupils . they get in the way . i have got to have time for composition .
composition does not pay . you know that .
this one will .
oh , let s not talk about it .
why not ?
it is a secret .
you do not have secrets from me .
it is too dangerous , papa . but they are going to love it . ah , there she is !
why did not you mention it in your letters ?
did not i ? i thought i did . i am sure i did .
why not ? oh , come , papa ! what better way could i spend it than on you ? my kissable , missable , suddenly visible papa !
this is just a game , papa .
i want you to come back with me to salzburg , my son .
but my penalty . i have got to have a penalty .
mine ?
i never saw this girl in my life . is this a kind of joke ?
papa !
do not worry , i am not staying here to be a burden .
no one calls you that .
she does . she says i sleep all day .
hush ! i am talking to his majesty . your majesty , i wish to express only one thing that you who are the father of us all , could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers . it is not for nothing that the fifth commandment tells us honour your father and mother , that your days may be long upon the earth .
good morning , sir .
what have you got for me today ? let me see .
i will , sir .
yes , thank you , sir .
bene ! bene !
bene .
do any pupils come to the house ?
not that i have seen .
then how does he pay for all this ? does he work at all ?
oh , yes , sir , all day long . he never leaves the house until evening . he just sits there , writing and writing . he does not even eat .
really ? what is it he is writing ?
oh , i would not know that , sir .
of course not . you are a good girl . you are very kind to do this . next time you are sure they will be out of the house , let me know , will you ?
yes what ?
in there , sir .
i am leaving . i am not working there anymore . i am scared !
why ? what has happened ?
you do not know what it is like . herr mozart frightens me . he drinks all day , then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse .
what medicine ?
i do not know . he has pains .
where ?
here , in his stomach . they bend him right over .
is he working ?
i am frightened , sir . really ! when he speaks , he does not make any sense . you know he said he saw he said he saw his father . and his father s dead .
is he working ?
i suppose so . he sits there all he time , doing some silly opera .
opera ? opera !
please do not ask me to go back again . i am frightened ! i am very , very frightened .
are you sure it is an opera ?
are you herr mozart ?
that is right .
my name is lorl , sir . i am a maidservant . i was asked to come here and offer my services to you .
what ?
they will be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon anonymous .
yes . i can live in or out just as you wish .
stanzi manzi banzi wanzi !
sssh ! stay here .
papa , the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room .
sublime ! utterly sublime !
that kind of music should be punishable by death .
yes , well , it is all good fun .
i liked the horse .
i would like to try them someday . i am not sure i would be much good at it .
course you would . you belong here , my boy , not the snobby court . you could do anything you felt like here the more fantastic the better ! that is what people want , you know fantasy . you do a big production , fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you will be absolutely free to do anything you want . of course , you would have to put a fire in it , because i have got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood i can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life . oh , and a few trick animals . you would have to use those .
animals ?
i tell you i picked up a snake in dresden last week twelve foot long folds up to six inches , just like a paper fan . it is a miracle .
german !
of course ! what else do you think they speak here ?
no , no , i love that . i would want it to be in german . i have not done anything in german since seraglio .
so there you are . what do you say ?
wolfi !
put it down !
what is this ?
put it down , i said ! it is nothing for you .
oh ! i am sorry ! i am sorry ! what have you got for me ? is it finished ?
what ?
what ? the vaudeville , what would you think ?
yes .
can i see it ?
no .
why not ?
because there s nothing to see .
well , we can .
so let me see it . where is it ?
and which one of them do you want me to teach ?
what ? ha ha ! that is funny i like it . which one , eh ? you are a funny fellow . hannah ! come this way .
madame .
this is herr mozart , my dear . the young man herr salieri recommended to teach our gertrude . where is she ?
of course , it is him . who do you think it is ?
strudel , this is herr mozart . say good morning .
well , yes ! on the whole . i suppose . how long have you been playing , fraulein ?
well , i am a good teacher . the next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs , please let me know . goodbye , fraulein , goodbye , madame ! goodbye , sir !
is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music ?
well , your pupil is married and living in mannheim , young man .
really ? perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction ?
what is this , mozart ? that is the matter with you ?
well . since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services , could you favour me with a little money instead ?
what for ?
if a man cannot earn , he must borrow .
well , this is hardly the way to go about it .
no doubt , sir . but i am endowed with talent , and you with money . if i offer mine , you should offer yours .
please . i will give it back , i promise . please , sir .
my answer is no , mozart .
really ?
mio caro adone .
ah !
a funny little tune , but it yielded some good things .
ah , love ! well of course in italy we know nothing about that .
but this is absurd !
did you like it , then ?
how could i not ?
it really is the best music one can hear in vienna today . do not you agree ?
your excellency , you requested some specimens of my work . here they are . i do not have to tell you how much i need your help . i truly appreciate your looking at these . i have pressures on me financial pressures . as you know , i am a married man now .
so you are . how is your pretty wife ?
she is well . she is well , actually , i am about to become a father ! she only told me last night . you are the first to know .
i am flattered . and congratulations to you , of course .
so you see , this post is very important to me right now .
why ? here is the music . it is here . i am submitting it humbly . is not that what you wanted ?
i have just come from the palace . the post has been filled .
filled ? that is impossible ! they have not even seen my work . i need this post . please , cannot you help me ? please !
my dear mozart , there is no one in the world i would rather help , but now it is too late .
whom did they choose ?
herr sommer .
sommer ? herr sommer ? but the mangs a fool ! he is a total mediocrity .
no , no , no he has yet to achieve mediocrity .
but i cannot lose this post , i simply cannot ! excellency , please . let s go to the palace , and you can explain to the emperor that herr sommer is an awful choice . he could actually do musical harm to the princess !
an implausible idea . between you and me , no one in the world could do musical harm to the princess elizabeth .
you do not mean to tell me you are living in poverty ?
no , but i am broke . i am always broke . i do not know why .
it has been said , my friend , that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means .
how can anyone say that ? we have no cook , no maid . we have no footman . nothing at all !
how is that possible ? you give concerts , do not you ? i hear they are quite successful .
they are stupendously successful . you cannot get a seat . the only problem is none will hire me . they all want to hear me play , but they will not let me teach their daughters . as if i was some kind of fiend . i am not a fiend !
of course not .
do you have a daughter ?
i am afraid not .
well , could you lend me some money till you have one ? then i will teach her for free . that is a promise . oh , i am sorry . i am being silly . papa s right i should put a padlock on my mouth . seriously , is there any chance you could manage a loan ? only for six months , eight at most . after that i will be the richest man in vienna . i will pay you back double . anything . name your terms . i am not joking . i am working on something that is going to explode like a bomb all over europe !
ah , how exciting ! tell me more .
i would better not . it is a bit of a secret .
come , come , mozart i am interested . truly .
actually , it is a big secret . oh , this is delicious ! what is it ?
cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum . crema al mascarpone .
ah . italian ?
forgive me . we all have patriotic feelings of some kind .
two thousand , two hundred florins is all i need a hundred ? fifty ?
what exactly are you working on ?
i cannot say . really
i do not think you should become known in vienna as a debtor , mozart . however , i know a very distinguished gentleman i could recommend to you . and he has a daughter . will that do ?
it is unbelievable ! the director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music . pages of it .
really ? why ?
i do not know . they say i have got to re write the opera , but it is perfect as it is . i cannot rewrite that is perfect . cannot you talk to him ?
why bother with orsini rosenberg ? he is obviously no friend of yours .
oh , i could kill him ! i mean really kill him . i actually threw the entire opera on the fire , he made me so angry !
you burned the score ?
oh no ! my wife took it out in time .
how fortunate .
it is not fair that a man like that has power over our work .
but there are those who have power over him . i think i will take this up with the emperor .
oh , excellency , would you ?
with all my heart , mozart .
thank you ! oh , thank you .
i know it is outrageous . still , if the public does not like one s work one has to accept the fact gracefully .
but what is it they do not like ?
well , i can speak for the emperor . you made too many demands on the royal ear . the poor man cannot concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four .
what did you think of it yourself ? did you like it at all ?
i think it is marvelous . truly .
it is the best opera yet written . i know it ! why did not they come ?
i think you overestimate our dear viennese , my friend . do you know you did not even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap ?
i know , i know . perhaps you should give me some lessons in that .
i would not presume . all the same , if it would not be imposing , i would like you to see my new piece . it would be a tremendous honour for me .
oh no , the honour would be all mine .
grazie , mio caro , wolfgang !
grazie , a lei , signor antonio !
how could i not ?
did my work please you ?
how could it not , excellency ?
yes ?
i never knew that music like that was possible .
you flatter me .
oh no ! one hears such sounds and what can one say , but salieri !
what work ?
a mass for the dead .
what dead ? who is dead ?
a man who deserved a requiem mass and never got one .
who are you ?
i am only a messenger . do you accept ? you will be paid well .
how much ?
work fast . and be sure to tell no one what you do . you will see me again soon .
are you neglecting my request ?
no , no ! i promise you , i will give you a wonderful piece the best i ever can !
i am taking you home . you are not well .
no , no . i have to get back . i have
not here ! she is not well , either . she went to the spa .
you mean she is not coming back ?
you are so good to me . truly . thank you .
no , please .
i mean to come to my opera . you are the only colleague who did .
this is only a vaudeville .
oh no . it is a sublime piece . the grandest operone . i tell you , you are the greatest composer known to me .
do you mean that ?
i do .
i have bad fancies . i do not sleep well anymore . then i drink too much , and think stupid things .
are you ill ?
the doctor thinks i am . but
what ?
i am too young to be so sick .
no ! no , it is him !
who ?
the man . he is here .
what man ?
finish what ?
he knows . he knows !
yes . can i could i help you , in any way ?
would you ? actually , you could .
my dear friend , it would be my greatest pleasure .
but you would have to swear not to tell a soul . i am not allowed .
of course .
you know , it is all here in my head . it is just ready to be set down . but when i am dizzy like this my eyes will not focus . i cannot write .
then , let us try together . i would regard it as such an honour . tell me , what is this work ?
a mass . a mass for the dead .
the end of the recordare statuens in parte dextra .
so now the confutatis . confutatis maledictis . when the wicked are confounded . flammis acribus addictis . how would you translate that ?
consigned to flames of woe .
do you believe in it ?
what ?
a fire which never dies . burning one forever ?
oh , yes .
strange !
come . let s begin .
we ended in f major ?
yes .
so now a minor . suddenly .
what time ?
common time .
yes .
third measure , second beat starting on e . flam mis a cri bus ad dic tis . and fourth measure , fourth beat d . ma le dic tis , flam mis a cri bus ad dic tis . do you have that ?
i think so .
sing it back .
yes .
fourth measure , second beat f . flam mis a cri bus ad dic tis , flam mis a cri bus ad dic tis .
please ! just one moment .
first bassoon and tenor trombone what ?
with the tenors .
also identical ?
exactly . the instruments to go with the voices . trumpets and timpani , tonic and dominant .
oh no . now for the fire . strings in unison ostinato on all like this .
i think so .
show me .
yes , yes go on . the voca me . suddenly sotto voce . write that down sotto voce , pianissimo . voca me cum benedictis . call me among the blessed .
sopranos up to f on the second voca ?
yes , and on wouldictis .
yes !
you go fast !
do you have it ?
yes .
then let me hear it . all of it . the whole thing from the beginning now !
oh no . i am not tired at all .
we will stop for just a moment . then we will do the lacrimosa .
i can keep going , i assure you . shall we try ?
would you stay with me while i sleep a little ?
i am not leaving you .
i am so ashamed .
what for ?
i was foolish . i thought you did not care for my work or me . forgive me . forgive me !
i i do not think you have , herr director . not yet . i mean , it is quite n of course , i will show it to you immediately .
i think you would better .
exactly .
then why especially does it have to be in german ?
well not especially . it can be in turkish , if you really want . i do not care .
but , your majesty
just let me tell you how it begins .
certainly , herr director .
yes , but this is not a ballet . this is a dance at figaro s wedding .
exactly . a dance .
but surely the emperor did not mean to prohibit dancing when it is part of the story .
it is dangerous for you to interpret his majesty s edicts . give me your score , please .
taking out what you should never have put in .
oh yes , certainly . certainly , herr director !
what is what ?
why do i have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee ? just to teach a sixteen year old girl .
because his majesty wishes it .
is the emperor angry with me ?
on the contrary .
then why does not he simply appoint me to the post ?
mozart , you are not the only composer in vienna .
no , but i am the best .
a little modesty would suit you better .
who is on this committee ?
kapellmeister bonno , count orsini rosenberg and court composer salieri .
naturally , the italians ! of course ! always the italians !
mozart
they hate my music . it terrifies them . the only sound italians understand is banality . tonic and dominant , tonic and dominant , from here to resurrection ! ba ba ! ba ba ! ba ba ! ba ba ! anything else is morbid .
mozart
show them one interesting modulation and they faint . ohime ! morbidezza ! morbidezza ! italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music !
look , young man , the issue is simple . if you want this post , you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues .
must i ? well , i will not ! i tell you straight i will not !
may i just do that , majesty ? show you how it begins ? just that ?
oh , german ! german ! please let it be german .
why not ? it is charming . i mean , i do not actually show concubines exposing their ! their ! it is not indecent ! it is highly moral , majesty . it is full of proper german virtues . i swear it . absolutely !
baron !
sire , only opera can do this . in a play , if more than one person speaks at the same time , it is just noise . no one can understand a word . but with music , with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once , and it is not noise it is a perfect harmony . is not that marvelous ?
mozart , music is not the issue here . no one doubts your talent . it is your judgment of literature that is in question . even with the politics taken out , this thing would still remain a vulgar farce . why waste your spirit on such rubbish ? surely you can choose more elevated themes ?
elevated ? what does that mean ? elevated ! the only thing a man should elevate is oh , excuse me . i am sorry . i am stupid . but i am fed up to the teeth with elevated things ! old dead legends ! how can we go on forever writing about gods and legends ?
because they do . they go on forever at least what they represent . the eternal in us , not the ephemeral . opera is here to ennoble us . you and me , just as much as his majesty .
i am father vogler . i am a chaplain here . i thought you might like to talk to someone .
about what ?
you tried to take your life . you do remember that , do not you ?
so ?
in the sight of god that is a sin .
what do you want ?
do you understand that you have sinned ? gravely .
leave me alone .
i cannot leave alone a soul in pain .
do you know who i am ? you never heard of me , did you ?
that makes no difference . all men are equal in god s eyes .
are they ?
offer me your confession . i can offer you god s forgiveness .
i do not seek forgiveness .
my son , there is something dreadful on your soul . unburden it to me . i am here only for you . please talk to me .
how well are you trained in music ?
i know a little . i studied it in my youth .
where ?
here in vienna .
then you must know this .
i am surprised you do not know . it was a very popular tune in its day . i wrote it . how about this ?
i regret it is not too familiar .
can you recall no melody of mine ? i was the most famous composer in europe when you were still a boy . i wrote forty operas alone . what about this little thing ?
i did not . that was mozart . wolfgang amadeus mozart . you know who that is ?
of course . the man you accuse yourself of killing .
ah you have heard that ?
all vienna has heard that .
and do they believe it ?
is it true ?
do you believe it ?
should i ?
he was murdered , father ! mozart ! cruelly murdered .
did you try ?
every day . sometimes for hours i would pray !
you cannot say that !
no ? was mozart a good man ?
god s ways are not yours . and you are not here to question him . offer him the salt of penitence . he will give you back the bread of eternal life . he is all merciful . that is all you need to know .
all i ever wanted was to sing to him . that is his doing , is not it ? he gave me that longing then made me mute . why ? tell me that . if he did not want me to serve him with music , why implant the desire , like a lust in my body , then deny me the talent ? go on , tell me ! speak for him !
my son , no one can speak for god .
oh ? i thought you did so every day . so speak now . answer me !
i do not claim to unravel the mysteries . i treasure them . as you should .
oh yes , yes , yes , yes , yes ! always the same stale answers ! there is no god of mercy , father . just a god of torture .
his funeral imagine it ! the cathedral , all vienna sitting there . his coffin , mozart s little coffin in the middle . and suddenly in that silence , music . a divine music bursts out over them all , a great mass of death requiem mass for wolfgang mozart , composed by his devoted friend antonio salieri . what sublimity ! what depth ! what passion in the music ! salieri has been touched by god at last . and god , forced to listen . powerless powerless to stop it . i at the end , for once , laughing at him . do you understand ? do you ?
yes .
the only thing that worried me was the actual killing . how does one do that ? how does one kill a man ? it is one thing to dream about it . it is very different when you have to do it , with your own hands .
i did .
no , you did not !
i poisoned his life .
but not his body .
what difference does that make ?
my son , why should you want all vienna to believe you a murderer ? is that your penance ? is it ?
no , father . from now on no one will be able to speak of mozart without thinking of me . whenever they say mozart with love , they will have to say salieri with loathing . and that is my immortality at last ! our names will be tied together for eternity his in fame and mine in infamy . at least it is better than the total oblivion he would planned for me , your merciful god !
oh my son , my poor son !
do not pity me . pity yourself . you serve a wicked god . he killed mozart , not i . took him , snatched him away , without pity . he destroyed his beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory . he does not care . understand that . god cares nothing for the man he denies and nothing either for the man he uses . he broke mozart in half when he would finished with him , and threw him away . like an old , worn out flute .
yes ?
mozart is writing a new opera . an italian opera .
italian ?
exactly .
he is setting that play to music ?
yes .
you must be mad .
i have seen the manuscript .
where ?
never mind .
incredible .
the emperor has given him permission .
about the ballet .
ballet ? what ballet ?
excuse me did not his majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera ?
yes , absolutely . is there a ballet in figaro ?
yes , in the third act .
well done , sire !
did we ?
for the same reason , herr chamberlain , that it was banned in france .
oh yes , yes . and that was ?
well , the play makes a hero out of a valet . he outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher . do you see the implications ? this would be , in a grander situation , as if a chamberlain were to expose an emperor .
ah .
what ? who the devil are you ?
i have taken pity on you , my angel . i heard your wish .
oh . well , thank you ! how wonderful . some people get all the luck .
i cannot wait .
well , promise then .
what do you mean now ?
of course now . right away , before i get any older .
oh , i am tender enough for you , my boy . i am tender enough for you .
i agree , baron .
cannot you think of anyone who might commission some work from him ? i have done my best . i got him to arrange some bach for my sunday concerts . he got a fee what i could afford . cannot you think of anyone who might do something for him ?
no , baron , no . i am afraid mozart is a lost cause . he has managed to alienate practically the whole of vienna . he is constantly drunk . he never pays his debts . i cannot think of one person to whom i dare recommend him .
how sad . it is tragic , is not it ? such a talent .
indeed . just a moment as a matter of fact i think i do know someone who could commission a work from him . a very appropriate person to do so . yes .
who is she ?
she did not say . but she says it is urgent .
excuse me , my dear .
show her in . then go to bed .
he did not say , sir . i told him i did not know when you would be back , but he insisted on waiting .
come with me . and stay in the room .
yes , i am looking after him .
can we come in ?
well , he is sleeping now . better not .
but he is all right ?
oh , yes . he is just exhausted . he became dizzy , that is all . we should let him rest .
well , tell him we were here , will not you ?
of course .
and say everything went wonderfully . a triumph de luxe say that ! tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times .
bene .
i will call tomorrow .
yes . and congratulations to all of you . it was superb .
yes , indeed . goodnight to you all now . it was perfection truly !
the american ? yes , duck .
how did he look ?
what do you mean , how did he look ?
you know , did he seem depressed ? do you think he will eat the food ?
i am an orderly , not a bleeding psychiatrist ! i push things about , but i have little say what happens to them .
thank you .
miss gallagher , surely you must perform some function here at the hospital .
dr . hirsch ?
go about your duties .
yes , doctor .
yes , doctor ?
what exactly did he call out ?
he said jack .
that would be jack goodman , the boy who was killed .
what happened to them ?
the police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them . he must have been a very powerful man . although i really do not see that it is any of your concern , miss price .
no , sir . of course , sir . good day , doctor .
yes , i believe he did .
come to my office , miss price .
yes , sir .
it is a full moon . where is he ?
at my flat . i am off at midnight and . . .
alex , has david persisted in his werewolf fantasies ?
well , yes , but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend .
has his friend appeared to him again ?
yes .
what did he say ?
david says jack comes to warn him .
warn him ?
dr . hirsch , that is wrong ? is this more serious than i know ?
i tried to investigate the attack . there are no records . the case was closed and now they have misplaced the file . david s lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before i did . the goodman boy is already in the ground so he is no good to us . so i went to the pub in east proctor where i was convinced of two things .
yes .
they were lying . there were no witnesses , no escaped lunatic . the whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there .
and what else ?
i think the village of east proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret . i am convinced that , like david , they believe in this werewolf .
no . he knows no one in london , besides me . i should not have left him alone .
david has suffered a severe trauma . i myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in east proctor . if all the villagers believe that jack goodman was killed by a werewolf , why should not david ? and then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf , would not he himself become a werewolf the next full moon ?
dr . hirsch ?
oh , i do not mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon . but in such a deranged state he could harm himself , or perhaps others .
what shall we do ?
let s call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy .
is he all right ? why did not you call me ? where was he ?
he does not remember . he woke up at the zoo .
the zoo ? is he rational ?
yes , he is . he is very excited and confused , but he is not crazy , if that is what you mean .
have you read the papers today ? have you listened to the radio or television ?
no , why ?
is david acting strangely ?
no , not really .
yes , i should think so .
right . now listen carefully . i want you to bring david here . i want him in my care . i will notify the police that we have found him . it is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital . do you understand ?
yes , doctor .
you are certain he is lucid ? you will not need any help ?
he is fine . we will come right over .
shall i send a car ?
no , a cab will be faster .
i expect you shortly .
tea would be nice .
david ?
i doubt it . but it is something to do .
i beg your pardon ?
it was a wolf .
what ?
a wolf .
yes ?
you have not eaten your lunch .
i am not very hungry , thank you .
i am afraid you have to eat something .
please , really . i am not hungry .
you put me in an awkward position , mr . kessler .
how is that ?
well , you are to take these after you have eaten . now what kind of nurse would i be if i failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills ?
leave the pills . i will take them later .
sorry .
call me alex .
aw come on , alex !
shall i be forced to feed you , mr . kessler ?
shall i be forced to feed you , david ?
this is absurd . i am not hungry . i do not want any food .
right .
will you give me a break ?
i thought you were asleep .
i was . what are you reading ?
a connecticut yankee in king arthur s court by mark twain .
do you like it ?
i have just started it . my friend gave it to me .
i dream of death mostly .
i am sorry . i should not have asked you .
it is okay . i want to talk to you .
that is not really a very proper question .
how old are you ?
twenty eight .
i am twenty seven .
i know .
now what do you want to talk about ?
was jack goodman your good friend ?
my best friend . my very best friend .
shall i read to you ?
what ? oh , yes , please .
a connecticut yankee in king arthur s court by samuel l . clemens . this is after the preface but before chapter one a word of explanation . you all right ?
yes , go on .
ahem , a word of explanation . it was in warwick castle that i came across the curious stranger whom i am going to talk about . he attracted me by three things his candid simplicity , his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor , and the restfulness of his company for he did all the talking . we fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd . . .
i am sorry i woke you up .
do not be silly . can i get you something ?
no , thank you . just keep me company for a while .
that is easy enough .
i keep having these really terrible dreams . they are getting worse and i cannot seem to stop them .
david , your dreams will stop . you will leave england and your bad memories and then this will all fade away .
will you come with me ?
what ?
i am serious . you do not know me and i know nothing about you . we have a perfect relationship .
now , david , i said i would keep you company , but i meant right here and now .
will you think about it ?
how did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient ?
not just a patient me .
you are being awfully forward , are not you ?
forgive me , i am trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it .
all i am to you is a sex fantasy then ?
now i am embarrassed .
good . i thought for a moment i was the only embarrassed one in the room .
a werewolf ?
i will let you know the next full moon .
you are to be discharged tomorrow . will you be all right ?
your dead friend jack ?
yeah . he says that i will become a monster in two days . what do you think ?
what do i think ? you mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends ?
i was dreaming again ?
i would think so .
yeah , i would think so , too .
very nice .
charming .
bathroom .
lovely .
the bedroom .
there is only one bed .
david , perhaps you would like to watch the telly while i take a shower .
it is nice to see you .
yes ?
will you be here in about fifteen minutes ?
of course .
good .
i was awake and he was in my room .
but , david .
i was not hallucinating .
that is good , alex . reassure me .
do me an enormous favor ?
anything .
tell me that it is silly of me to be apprehensive .
it is silly of you to be apprehensive .
werewolves simply do not exist .
david , do you want me to stay here tonight ?
yeah , i do , but go to work .
okay .
i have left those pills for you .
a doper werewolf .
see you later .
i am freezing .
the zoo ?
waking up at the zoo , that is not so insane . having no clothes on ? that is insane . what did i do last night , alex ?
do not you remember ?
i said goodbye to you . i was locked out of the flat . i climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window . i started to read and then i was naked at the zoo ! i guess i am out of my fucking mind .
i should be committed .
dr . hirsch will know what to do .
i do not know why i feel so good . i have not felt this good in a long time .
pull over .
six people mutilated ? it had to be me , alex .
david , stop !
jack is dead !
jack is dead . look , six people have been killed . i am going to the police .
rational ! ? ! i am a fucking werewolf , for christ s sake !
what ?
we had an argument . he is being silly .
i swear , i do not know this girl .
will you shut up ! ? ! !
david , let s go now .
david , do not lose control .
control ! ? ! what control ! ? ! get away from me !
no .
no what ?
no .
well , all right then , be that way . here , swallow this .
no .
no .
the doctor will be round later . would you like a picture book to look at ? we have some lovely funny beanos .
no .
right .
no .
no what ?
no !
benjamin , have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck ?
no .
i thought not .
yes , i should think . he called out just now .
he is an american , you know . dr . hirsch is going to fetch round one of those embassy fellows to see him .
chart says he is from new york .
i think he is a jew .
why on earth do you say that ?
i looked .
really , susan , i do not think that was very proper , and besides , it is common practice now .
yes , mrs . hobbs .
take these round now , will you please ? the american boy in twenty one is only to have these after he is eaten . will you be sure of that ?
has he been refusing food ?
nothing quite as dramatic as that , miss price . he just does not eat enough of what is put before him . he suffers from nightmares . i would think he just needs a hand to hold .
yes , mrs . hobbs .
you did , did you ?
hey , you asshole ! i want you to arrest me !
there s no call for that kind of language .
queen elizabeth is a man ! prince charles is a faggot ! winston churchill was full of shit !
now see here young man .
shakespeare was french ! the queen mother sucks cocks in hell ! shit ! fuck ! piss !
you are going to have to stop this disturbance or i shall arrest you .
that is what i want you to do , you moron !
this is not mr . goodmangs idea . he is your good friend , whereas i am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities .
mr . bringsly , i am sorry . i have absolutely no idea what to say to you .
you have left my wife a widow and my children fatherless . and i understand that i am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf s bloodline is severed and the curse lifted .
no , david . harry and i and everyone you murder are not dead . the undead .
why are you doing this to me ?
no , but we are about to .
quiet , everyone ! hush ! shhh !
oh , come on , tell us .
no . you have had your chance .
that is very funny , that is .
you could have told them !
i was having a nightmare .
what time is it ?
it is nearly eight . i am off duty shortly , then i am off to the films with alex .
alex ?
miss price , the other nurse that attended you .
what are you going to see ?
an american film about the mafia called see you next wednesday , and i want to see it badly , so you give me no problems and go to sleep .
do you have bad dreams , too ?
some , everyone does .
yes , but does everyone kill bambi ?
bambi ?
where am i ?
you are in a hospital in london .
london ? where is jack ? i had a strange dream .
i should think so after your recent traumatic experiences .
the guy i was with . is he all right ? how did i get to london ?
now , david , i want you to prepare yourself your friend is dead .
get your fucking hands off me ! what the hell is going on here ?
you have been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago .
two weeks ?
you have suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises , lost a bit of blood , but nothing too serious black and blue for a while . you will have some dueling scars to boast of . that lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow . they say a mad man has the strength of ten .
lunatic ?
now we have just given you a pretty strong sedative , so try to get some rest now . miss price will see to your needs . rest now .
so they said .
how could there have been witnesses ? it was so dark . we were running and i fell and jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere . . . i do not understand what they are talking about .
in time i am sure it will all come back to you .
doctor , my memory is fine . it is my sanity i am beginning to worry about .
sure , as a kid . but never so real . never so bizarre .
i have told you , it was not a man . it was an animal . a big wolf or something . a rabid dog .
yes .
look , dr . hirsch , i know i have been traumatized , but jack was torn apart . i saw him . a man cannot do that to someone with his bare hands .
you would be surprised what horrors a man is capable of .
did you see jack ?
no . in fact , your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here .
did you talk to the police in east proctor ? did the cops go to the slaughtered lamb ?
i really do not know .
then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me ? you yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that .
david , please . the police are satisfied . i am certain that if a monster were out roaming northern england we would have seen it on the telly .
you really think i am crazy , do not you ?
believe me . the hound of the baskervilles was an invention of sir arthur conan doyle s . and if you would read the bloody book , you would find that holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud , a fake .
of course not , david . i will fetch in young miss price .
yes .
good .
david .
you are not having a good time are you ?
oh , i do not know . i mean look around . is not this a fun place ?
i am sorry . northern england first , italy later .
right .
i think debbie klein is a mediocre person with a good body .
debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time .
she is a jerk .
you are talking about the woman i love .
i am talking about a girl you want to fuck , so give me a break .
well , anyway , do you think she will be there ?
i do not know .
rendezvous in rome starring jack goodman and debbie klein . the love affair that shocked europe ! see torrid lovemaking at its most explicit ! see jack and debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the vatican ! never has the screen dared . . .
if you do not stop , i am going to kill you .
i have to make love to her . it is very simple . she has no choice really .
it just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull .
it is impossible for a body like that to be dull .
we have known debbie what , since the eighth grade ? how many years of foreplay is that ?
she says she likes me too much .
of course , the slaughtered lamb . why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol ?
that is a wolf s head .
of course , the slaughtered lamb . why else would they have a severed wolf s head on a spear as their symbol ?
that is not a spear . it is a pike .
a severed wolf s head on a pike as their symbol .
david , before we go in there i want you to know that no matter what happens to us it is your fault .
i assume full responsibility .
okay .
shall we ?
nice to see you .
listen , at least it is warm in here .
look at that .
it is a five pointed star .
maybe the owners are from texas .
you ask them .
listen , that is a pentangle , a five pointed star . it is used in witchcraft . lon chaney , jr . and universal studios maintain it is the mark of the wolf man .
i see . you want me to ask these people if they are burning candles to ward off monsters .
right .
wrong .
you ask them .
what do you mean ? i am starving .
apparently so .
i do not know . let s see if there s an inn or something up the road .
beware the moon ?
come on , i am freezing .
i do not know . now that we are out here and it is three degrees , i am not so sure i would not rather face a blood thirsty mob .
well , not quite a blood thirsty mob .
i have no idea .
maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural .
i see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it , because they felt so silly .
i am well aware of how pleasant the weather is in rome at the present time thank you .
i heard that .
what was it ?
yeah ?
a coyote .
there are not any coyotes in england .
the hound of the baskervilles .
pecos bill .
heathcliffe .
heathcliffe did not howl .
no , but he was on the moors .
it is a full moon , beware the moong .
yeah .
i do not know . come on .
come on , where ?
anywhere ! i think we should just keep moving .
it is circling us .
plan ?
let s just keep walking .
do you think it is a dog ?
a sheep dog or something . turn slowly and let s walk away .
walk away , jack .
walking away , yes , sir . here we are walking away .
no .
not far enough . come on .
yeah .
where are we going ?
i will tell you when we get there .
well . i am glad we . . . whoaa ! !
are you going to help me up ?
get the fuck out of here , jack .
thanks a lot .
this is too much . i cannot handle this .
i am aware that i do not look so great , but i thought you would be glad to see me .
hurting your feelings ? has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me ? listen to me , i am talking to a hamburger !
i am sorry to be upsetting you , david , but i had to come .
are not you supposed to be buried in new york someplace ?
yeah . your parents came to my funeral . i was surprised at how many people came .
why should you be surprised ? you were a very well liked person .
debbie klein cried a lot .
i cannot stand it .
so you know what she does ? she is so grief stricken she runs to find solace in rudy levine s bed .
rudy levine the shmuck ?
life mocks me even in death .
david !
what ? !
david , now i know this may be hard for you , but i have to warn you .
warn me ? will you get out of here , you meat loaf ?
i am a grisly sight , it is true but i love you and that is why i am here . you have got to know .
if you love me so much , jack , you will realize how disconcerting it is to share one s breakfast with the living dead !
we were attacked by a werewolf .
i am not listening !
on the moors , we were attacked by a lycanthrope , a werewolf .
shut up , you zombie !
i was murdered , an unnatural death , and now i walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf s curse is lifted .
that is wrong with you ? shut up !
the wolf s bloodline must be severed . the last remaining werewolf must be destroyed .
will you be quiet ? !
what ? !
you survived and now you shall continue the curse .
what are you talking about ? i will not accept this ! get out ! god damit !
remember what that guy at the slaughtered lamb said ? beware the moon .
stop it , jack .
beware the moon . the full moon , david . you have got two days .
jack , please go away . please go away .
you will stalk the streets of london a creature of the night .
you are talking like boris karloff ! it is movie dialogue !
david , please believe me . you will kill people , david . you have got to stop the bloodshed before it begins .
nurse !
listen to me ! take your own life , david . it is our only chance .
nurse !
the supernatural ! the powers of darkness ! it is all true . take your own life ! suicide , david . join me .
nurse ! oh god ! alex !
it is cold , david , and i am so alone . the undead surround me . have you ever talked to a corpse ? it is boring ! i am lonely ! kill yourself , david , before you kill others .
do not be an asshole , david . come here .
i wanted to see you .
okay , you have seen me . now go away .
david , i am sorry i upset you yesterday , but you must understand what is going on .
i understand all right . you are one of the undead and i am a werewolf .
yes .
get out of here , jack !
david , tomorrow night is the full moon . you will change , you will become . . .
a monster . i know , i know .
you must take your own life now , david , before it is too late .
jack , are you really dead ?
what do you think ?
i think i have lost my mind . i think you are not real . i think i am asleep and you are a part of another bad dream .
you must believe me .
what , jack ? that tomorrow night beneath the full moon i will sprout hair and fangs and eat people ? bullshit !
the canines will be real . you will taste real blood ! god damit , david , please believe me ! you will kill and make others like me ! i am not having a nice time , david ! do not allow this to happen again ! you must take your own life !
i will not accept this ! now go away !
hi , david .
you do not have to say anything .
are not you going to say , i told you so ?
if i was still alive , i probably would .
you look awful .
thank you .
i did not mean it . i do not know what i am saying . i am not even sure it was me who killed those people . i do not remember doing it .
what about the zoo ?
well , even if i am not the wolfman , i am crazy enough to do something like that . i mean , here i sit in leicester square talking to a corpse . i am glad to see you , jack .
i want you to meet some people .
hello .
gerald is the man you murdered in the subway . we thought it best you did not see him as he is a fresh kill and still pretty messy .
how shall i do it ?
if you did it wrong , it would be painful . you would choke to death .
come in , come in . please sit . some tea ?
well , then , what can i do for scotland yard ?
has david kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors ?
why do not we ask him ?
regardless of what you think , lieutenant , the fact remains that david is missing and that we must find him .
stay here . if we need you , we will know where to reach you .
lt . villiers and sgt . mcmanus are here to see you , doctor .
send them in .
roger mathison , doctor .
what here ?
he is on the telephone .
tell him i am out . no , tell him i have passed away . an old war wound or something . tell him i am dead . and no more calls !
campari and soda would do nicely .
sorry , love .
i suppose guinness will suffice .
oh , that is been there for two hundred years . we were going to paint it out , but it is traditional , so we left it .
i see . you have heard nothing about the incident ?
no .
we have got spirits and beer . if it is something hot you want , you can have tea .
then you have some hot tea ?
no .
oh .
but i can heat some up for you if you would like .
i beg your pardon ?
i would like some tea , please .
has mr . kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors ?
sgt . mcmanus , are you suggesting that david and jack were , in fact , attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of east proctor has conspired to keep it a secret ? we have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police . we have two witnesses to the crime . you will forgive me , mr . kessler , if i consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock .
lieutenant , the boy seems pretty lucid to me and . . .
and what , sergeant ?
i do not rightly know , sir .
that is precisely my point . david , as far as we are concerned , the matter is closed . we will not trouble you any further . good day .
we will find him , not to worry .
you here again ? what do you want ?
listen , i told you i was not interested in that deal , did not i ?
i want to know why .
i will tell you why . i do not like the crowd you are mixed up with . personally , you can have all the credit you want . but for that deal not a cent .
but listen , tom , i
she is a widow . i do not like taking mortgages from widows .
why not ?
yes sure
yeah sure !
i was the first one to see it . i was coming down the stairs , and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet .
no kidding ?
no kidding . when i saw it , you could a knocked me over with a pin .
where is matt ?
matt ?
yeah . he will have a tough time thinking up a wise crack for this one . . .
the detectives got matt up there in sampsongs office .
he has ?
yeah .
how much ?
about twenty four thousand .
it was more than that last week .
yeah .
here s twenty five thousand .
yeah .
let me have ten bucks ?
ten bucks ? say , if i had ten bucks , i would quit .
charlie !
yeah ?
baby , i cannot give you anything but love . . .
it will be yours if you do not kick in with that ten bucks .
say pal , did you ever hear of a depression ?
aw , nerts !
where do you think i have been ? i took the baby for a stroll in the park .
i am fourteen cents out , and it took me half an hour to find the mistake . and me with a date , too .
i remember once when your account checked .
yeah .
say , do not annoy me . i got troubles of my own .
not yet , mr . clark .
when he comes in , tell him we are waiting for him in the board room .
yes , sir .
and tell him not to delay .
yes , sir .
oh , is he ? we carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city . we are fools to tolerate it .
dickson does not have to go . but he must agree to this merger with new york trust
what good will that do ?
what good will that do ? why , it will take control away from him . we will put somebody else in charge , call in all doubtful loans , and be on safe ground again . that is what good it will do !
take it easy , clark .
all right , let him ! i am sick and tired of hearing about him . if he wants to run the bank , let him do it . i do not want any part of it .
i think , mr . dickson , we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning , if you do not mind .
oh , you would , eh ? all right . if it is more important than golf , go ahead . that is on your mind ?
just pure luck !
not at all . that is alexander hamiltongs idea the finest banking mind this country has ever known . those are his exact words , gentlemen . character ! it is the only thing you can bank on , and it is the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums .
i know , dickson . that is all very well . but you are taking too many chances . in these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble . in case of emergency !
gentlemen , you notice mr . dickson refuses to consider our wishes . he refuses an offer to merge with the new york trust the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground . he insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith !
yes ! you said it , clark . that is the only thing that means anything to me .
what about ?
we will discuss that in the board room .
what do you mean , help ?
i know that among you , you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city . get that money over here and i will stop this run within five minutes .
that sounds very simple , dickson , but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes ?
i have everything i own in it . it is your bank as well as mine , is not it ?
aw , they have gone crazy . you cannot reason with a mob .
no . you cannot reason with anyone else when you are in a jam . we pleaded with you to keep liquid , but you would not listen to us . you preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish . now you want our help . you want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you have wrecked . all right . there s one way you can get it . give us an option on your stock and resign as president .
so , that is it , eh ? you have waited a long time for this chance , have not you ? well , i am not going to resign now or ever .
i cannot ? you just wait and see . if that run does not stop within the next hour , i will shut the doors . you know what that means ? the bank examiner will step in tomorrow . you will be forced to liquidate . i will insist upon it . the depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar . that is left you gentlemen can have . but i will guarantee there will not be enough to pay your next month s garage bill .
the bank . all right . do anything you want with it .
we have been waiting fifteen minutes
you know what you can do with that ! come on , take a look at this ! you will see a demonstration of faith that is worth more than all the collateral in the world .
of course , yes . just what would you like to know , inspector ?
where were you at twelve o clock last night ?
that is very simple . i was home .
oh yes , of course . there was someone with me . a lady .
looks like you are going to have no trouble at all . what was the lady s name , mr . cluett ?
if you do not mind , inspector , i would rather not say that is , unless it becomes absolutely essential . you see , she is married .
oh !
you understand ?
why , of course .
somebody must be in good humor . he was humming mother machree .
it is one of the boys from headquarters . he always sings mother machree whenever he is got good news . looks like this case will be settled in no time .
all right , jack , all right .
stand back , inspector . let me out of here , or i will shoot you !
they took my keys yesterday . i went there to get them back .
do not forget there s a dead watchman downstairs .
i did not kill him ! i had nothing to do with that , i tell you ! i was home in my apartment last night i can prove it !
claims he was there with a married woman . does not want to mention her name .
he will not believe it , mr . dickson . but it is the truth honest it is . i was in my apartment last night ask your wife she
i do not know . it is all been like a crazy nightmare , mr . dickson .
what happened ? you are not a thief . how would you get mixed up with these kind of people ?
gambling i owed them a lot of money . last week i lost over fifty thousand dollars !
fifty thousand dollars !
but i did not kill that man last night . honest i did not , mr . dickson !
nothing , nothing , mr . dickson . do not pay any attention to me . i do not know what i am saying .
you just mentioned her name . what was she doing there ? what was she doing in your apartment ?
she just came up for a drink . just for a few minutes .
get out , get out !
i know , i know , dude . oh , i must have been crazy ! i lost my head completely !
that is your funeral . we have got fifty thousand dollars coming to us .
i have not got it .
i am sorry , dude , buti
that do not do us any good .
but after all , you cannot take blood from a stone .
we can take blood from anything if it is coming to us .
why not ?
why , i could not do that . . . !
you do not have to do nothing .
all you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we will do the rest , see ?
you ? no , you will be all right , so long as you establish an alibi for tonight .
know , but
be sure you are with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked . understand ?
but dude , listen could not we make this some other time ?
listen , buddy , you are getting by pretty easy . quit squawking !
why , i needed a
am i ? why , i i do not know any reason why i should be , unless of course it is you . . .
me ?
being alone with you has always done this to me . you know that .
for a celebrated bounder , that is an awful admission . besides , i never knew that any female could do this to you .
well , you can . you always could .
liar ! you are just suffering from lack of sleep .
what is ?
running around . not your work . you would better start reforming , cyril !
if i thought you were the slightest bit interested , i would .
not bad , not bad at all . do you know something ? i have always been curious about your line .
line ?
whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women .
but you see , it is not blarney where you are concerned .
now let me see , what comes next ? oh yes , i know what are you doing tonight , phyllis ?
yes , yes , it does . what are you doing tonight , phyllis ?
see , we are getting along famously !
please , please do not laugh at me , phyllis . i must see you tonight !
well
well , what ?
well , are not you going to invite me ?
you ? no can do . it is all set . just a few of tom s closest friends .
now phyllis , if you do not invite me , i am coming anyway .
do not be silly , cyril . these are respectable people . they would probably bore you to death .
no , they will not . not when you are there . oh , please , be a sport . please ask me .
why are you so anxious ?
do not you know ?
no .
i want to be near you !
do not you know i have been crazy about you for years ?
now wait a minute , wait a minute . . .
i have loved you ever since i can remember , long before you married tom dickson .
why , cyril , you are insane
no . no , i am not . i deliberately avoided you . i was afraid of making a fool of myself . but i will not stand it any longer
cyril !
my apartment .
i knew i could not trust you . you told me you were taking me home .
come on up for just a few minutes . we will have just one drink , then we will go .
no . i know the answer to that one . i think you would better take me home .
that is the matter ? afraid papa will spank ?
no . no , i am afraid papa is not that much interested . he is too busy rushing off to philadelphia to make stuffy , old speeches at stuffy , old bankers meetings . too busy closing big , important deals i think i will have a drink .
good for you . come on .
oh , you are not so badly off . there s something much worse than being a misunderstood wife .
what is that , mr . bones ?
a misunderstood bachelor .
i am not afraid of you . you have not got a moustache !
i will grow a moustache by the time you get out of here .
what are you doing here ?
yes , sir .
let me see your cash book , will you ?
now ?
yes , now .
oh , yeah ?
i am listening .
it is funny now that i am here , i do not know just how to go about it . you see , i kind of expected to find you here alone .
oh no , mr . cluett , if it is all the same to you , i would rather not wait . it is about you and mrs . dickson .
you have no right to do this to her , mr . cluett . why do not you think it over ? it is only gonna get you into a lot of trouble .
i tell you , i am not interested in your opinion .
no ? then maybe you will understand , mrs . dickson . oh , gee , he is crazy about you . nobody knows it better than you . if he ever finds out , it will kill him .
this is my business . mr . dicksongs been like a father to me . what has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this ?
that will be just about enough ! now get out of here !
i guess i have said enough i am just wasting my breath talking to you .
john , how is your wife this morning ?
much better this morning , thank you .
got a handkerchief ?
wait a minute . how do you feel this morning ?
i am feeling fine this morning .
that makes it unanimous . i feel all right too .

oh , i did have a date with you tonight , did not i ?
yes .
i am terribly sorry . i would forgotten all about you . i am so sorry , dear .
but i have to go , dear . it is a very important banker s meeting .
i do not care whether it is important or not . you said you were going out with me , and if you had not promised so faithfully , i would not have gone and planned the whole thing .
listen , it is not so terribly important . we can go to the theatre any time .
the theatre ?
that is what it was you planned , was not it ?
yes , of course .
you can take some of the girls . you can take mildred or gwynn
the girls ! i do not suppose it ever occurred to you that i might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
ho , ho , ho , yourself ! i would not laugh if i were you . you may not suspect it , but i am still attractive to some .
listen , do not go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
well . . .
do not you forget that i am still the head man around here too . now we will get the tickets changed for tomorrow night . you and i are going out together . how is that ?

oh , i can explain about that later . you are losing your bank do not you realize what that means ?
was mrs . dickson there ?
listen , mr . dickson , do not let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down . you have got more friends than anybody in this town . little guys guys who would not be in business if it were not for you . all you have got to do is

all right . that is all . please , matt .
but i have not . . .
i do not want to hear any more about it . if you do not get married , i will fire both of you .
gee , thanks , mr . dickson
i am afraid i must , mr . dickson .
why pick on him ?
it is an inside job . that is a cinch . whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout . now brown , here , is in charge of the vaults , is not he ?
yes .
the clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at .
all right . if the boy proves an alibi , he is all right , is not he ?
if he can do it , yes .
why , certainly he can . matt , now all you have got to do is tell them where you were last night , between twelve and twelve thirty , and everything will be all right .
good . you have got nothing to worry about . soon as the report comes in , you will be released . and listen , do not talk so loud . take it easy . coast a little .
what are you talking about ? he had no more to do with it than you did .
maybe . but i am taking no chances . why , this kid s got a record .
so have you . so have i . so s everybody got a record . what difference does that make ? you cannot go around pinning crimes on people just because they
listen , matt . if you do not tell the truth , i cannot help you . where were you last night ?
why , you must be crazy . i have known this man for years .
he is just confessed . he is been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town .
no wonder he did not want to mention her name .
do not worry , mr . dickson . we will find out whether he is telling the truth . i will have a man from headquarters check up on it right away .
you do not want to check up on anybody . i will do all the checking up . wait a minute .
here s the data on the clyde deal .
i am afraid he is been stalling .
that is just exactly what he has been doing . this deal should have been closed weeks ago . tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
he says he cannot get away in the daytime .
how about his nights ? he is too busy running around . tell him to keep tomorrow night open , come in and sign this thing , or i will call this whole deal off .
yes , sir .
what are you talking about ?
all right . send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away .
we have not much on hand , you know . if it gets any worse , i hope we do not have to close the doors .
yes , sir .
did you get the case for the securities ?
yes , sir .
mine too ?
yes , sir . but soon as our money runs out , they will mob the place .
what will we do ?
i will talk to them . listen , go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible . tell em not to pay any attention to what i said . tell em to verify every signature .
do not you think i know it ?
get all the big bills in the place . take them out and get them changed . get nothing but ones and fives . distribute them among the tellers . tell them to take their time . stall as much as possible . count and recount the money .
yes , sir .
i hate to do this , but i have got to have time to dig up some help . i think i know where i can get some real cash . snap into it , sampson . we will lick this thing yet .
is it safe ?
absolutely .
it is his life insurance money , you know .
but you said it would be safe ! it is his life insurance money . oh , please , i will go to the old ladies home if you do not do something , please !
please , lady . please be quiet . everything will be all right . open up here , folks . all right , folks , please !
is that busy husband of mine busy ?
he is at a board meeting .
board meeting . oh , that means hours , i suppose .
i am afraid so .
helen , did you ever try competing with a bank ?
no .
well , take my word for it , and do not try it . it is useless ! if it were some other woman , i could handle her , but after all , you cannot scratch a bank s eyes out now , can you ?
hardly .
all right .
matt , come here !
why ?
come here , honey !
oh , is that so ?

oh , you think i am lying ?
yes .

i do not care about the dooley sisters what time did he get in ?
that is just what i am trying to tell you , sir . it was a half hour after the dooley sisters . . .
was it twelve o clock ?
it could not have been earlier ?
no . it was not earlier because . . .
yes , i know . cause the dooley sisters were not in yet .

tom , i am this close to coming with you . . .
jim younger , i told you
sometimes a wound will kill .
now you tell us .
dammit , this stopped being fun about two years ago !
never a good thing .
anywhere nobody s shooting at me is pretty .
that was two hours ago .
zee , i am pleased you came .
the sheriff says it was a gang of drunk kansas boys .
i say we ride into town and kill us some pinkertons and railroad men .
better pass them over here before something happens to em .
you stay out of this , bob .
how ?
say we bust into a bank . we yell we are the younger james gang ! people are gonna be thinking , the younger james gang ? is there an older james gang ? how come we never heard of the older james gang ? so people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms .
frankly , yes . i am feeling a little left out .
what ?
it is still taking too long . the people used to snap to .
that was because of . . . the reputation the gang had .
as long as people think jesse s still riding , we will never get the respect we deserve .
cole , we are outlaws . not exactly the most respectable job , if you know what i mean .
leave me alone , bob .
what have you done ?
i ai not done
what have you done ? !
swear .
i swear
swear on jimmy s grave .
you are just upset about jesse . we all are .
he is not bad at it .
it is tougher than it looks .
i can hit those boys from here . we just need a distraction .

nope .
then i love it .
. . . will perry . . .
stop by our spread after that , tell our ma we are all right . we will go to doc mimms .

the army can hang him .
tomorrow .
best damn plan i heard all war .

exactly .
well , no , jesse , it was the bank s . that is why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it . you explain it to him .
we oughta take some of this , give it to our neighbors in liberty . lot of people hurting up there .
hey !
bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars .
one false move and i will blow your heads off !
you heard me , jesse . you know how crazy i get !
yes . i am obviously not standing out in people s minds at the robberies .
you are a fine figure of a man .
listen , jesse , we have got a problem . it is cole .
he is been full of vinegar lately .
he is planning a job .
what ?
listen , he is my brother and i do not want to start trouble . . .
tell me .
you , ya barrel of pork lard . here piggy piggy !
i think i recognize you .
how ?
i think i saw you leaving by the front door just as i was coming in the back .
no , really . you are wife said she needed some help , seeing as you were so fat you could not find your

i could use the walk .
suit yourself . we will have some horses waiting for you at the road . let s ride , rangers !
there s yankees back there . lot s of em .
planting corn . harvesting corn . year after year .
you are not scared , are you ?
pick your fights , cousin . you taught me that .
what is wrong with you ?
in case we have to kill these sonofabitches , i do not want them to see us coming .
she got two of them .
she was european !
all right , calm down . i will agree sadie was a woman
after all you did on our farm ? you miss it , do not you jesse ?
the war ? what , are you crazy ? there are things i miss about it .
it was exciting .
but it was a whole lot of killing . why should we miss that ?
yeah .
so what do we do , general lee ?
just like in the war . harass their supply lines . we kill the railroad s men , they will not care .
perfect , cole .
let s ride .
sorry .
do not let it happen again .
i got three .
just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words does not make him smart .
it is better . it is a construction depot . they will have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take . that way we can take on a bigger job .
twenty ? !
sure , cousin .
all the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the james younger gang .
yep .
why are not we the younger james gang ? i mean , there s three younger brothers and only two james brothers here .
hold on , hold on , we all know bob is an important part of the gang .
what will be ?
if you would read about it first , you would have no problems .
what are you saying ?
i have robbed just as many banks as you have ! i know this town , and i know this bank , and i say it is an easy job .
you are forgetting who s in charge
now the one time one of us comes up with an idea
a bad idea .
i got us through the war all right .
and almost got hanged in peacetime .
that is it .
and i am the better outlaw .
then let me run the show , general lee .
you will be smiling once you have got all that money to spend , cousin . cole younger s going to make everybody rich !
a trap .
clell , tom , go get doc mimms in liberty !
pass me some whisky .
i am out .
what ? ! we follow you for a year , and now that our blood s been spilled , you are gonna quit ? !
who s next ? you ? me ? bob ?
missed you too , cousin .
pff . all we been through , the thought never crossed my mind .
we did not . zerelda did . turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw .
you pay me to find you bluecoats . there they are .
you ride like a comanche .
hmm . go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack , or work for you . . .
well ?
i am thinking . . .
both would be nice .
soon as i hit one , the other will know and beat us up .
must be a garrison in town . we are in occupied territory , boys .
which one , right or left ?
the brown one .
sadie was not a man !
shakespeare . he is european .
ah .
get buckets !
strategically .
exactly . because this is a war .
oh , you are in charge ? we ai not partners any more , jesse ? you tell cole younger where and when to ride ?
cole , he did not mean that .
they gonna rush us ?
they are just insurance in case we run .
of course ! uh , sir ?
what ?
where is jesse james ?
this here is the younger gang !
all right , all right . jesse james never yelled at folk . . .
yeah , injun . what do you want ?
great chief of st . louis send me .
the district marshall
ho yah . him say tell big lawman in carville that badman jesse james riding toward rising sun , above great river , near eagle rock .
east ? east above the river heading for the eagle pass ?
ho yah !
me get heap firewater
you are right , sir .
then why cannot i go in there ?
on account of we are robbing it .
oh . why did not you just say so ?
it is a secret .
fine . i will just wait here .
i would appreciate that .
what is it ?
old man tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank .
so ?
when have you ever known old man tucker not to be yelling at everybody ?
i had you covered . from back there .
shit .
my little web did that ?
pff . he jumped his horse clear over our heads , killed a dozen union soldiers before they knew what hit them .
died a hero .
go home , doc . they ai not gonna hang no more liberty boys .
go on . you are pretty much all healed up .
yesss , but i was thinking , i could come by , and then take zee out . some place near . with other folk . near . here . but out .
it is fine by me , jesse .
zerelda , it is no coincidence . the railroad men come through , offering to buy up land . nobody sells . then they start hanging men who own farms for treason ?
the bullet came out clean , but he lost a whole lot of blood . praying would not hurt .
i fooled them into thinking i was alone .
well , i hope the boy pulls through . we should know in the morning .
i think he is already feeling better .
i am upset too , zee , but jesse and cole know what they are doing . i am sure they will not press their luck .
so we got a plan ?
pff . they hardly even noticed you .
so you are saying i could have done more to attract their attention .
mm hmm .
such as ?
you could have worn one of those big , floppy womangs easter sunday hats .
that would have made an impression .
i figure .
see , that is your problem , frank . by the time you finish figuring out stuff , i am already finished doing it .
no , jesse , your problem is you are always doing stuff before i am finished figuring it out .
i reckoned .
hell of a war .
i am sure it seemed like a good idea at the time .
all this time in the saddle . . . we get to the farm , i am going to shoot this damn horse just on principle .
we better go to doc s , see that is going on here .
you are doing just fine .
zee , we got to talk to you and your father .
saved all our lives , doc . none of the liberty boys would have come home if not for web mimms , doc . god s honest truth .
think about this . if we just come up with a story and stick to it , we should be all right .
what kind of story are they going to believe ?
maybe , maybe . . .
you can shut up now .
you are a charmer .
i swear i will shoot you in your sleep .
next time try fat and haggard .
what worries me is that jesus is talking back .
your zee ? hmm . from womengs eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still the right promethean fire they are the books , the arts , the academes , that show , contain , and nourish all the world .
heard of him .
damn . all that reading paid off .
what do you think ?
would you get in the carriage ? until ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself , she is gonna make me miserable .
shut up . uh , doc , i was wondering if , uh , this evening , i could come by ?
ma .
do not care .
did not think you would . i am going to go make the coffin .
make a thousand of em . still will not be enough by the time i am through .
fine . how would it go out here ?
we are gonna have to talk . . .
and that is why you both lead the gang . two of you went into that bank together , right ?
and i do so want to shoot some pinkerton detectives .
it is the scientific method . it is all the rage .
bob s upset .
the posters ?
bob here will kill a man for sneezing , and he is the best shot in the gang .
jesse , we are outlaws .
and we are good at it .
it got to you , did not it . all the killing in the war . you need it now .
you have killed your fair share of men .
if i could go back to farming
that is a lie . you could have bought a dozen farms with the money we have stolen .
i cannot quit and leave you alone . i cannot quit until you quit . ma would have wanted it that way .
we are doing this for ma .
maybe it started out that way . but now . . .
what do you want me to say , frank ? i was killing men when i was fifteen . i like getting shot at . i like riding out of town with a posse at my back . this is a helluva better life than farming .
a better life than the one you could have had with zee ?
oh yeah .
just do me a favor . think about what this is costing everybody . not just the railroad .
no , i
got any ideas , little brother ?
jim was old enough . . .
he was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the west . how was he supposed to say no to that ?
railroad burned him out too . you could not have stopped him .
you are a piss poor liar for the smartest man i know .
yeah .
a war against the railroad . what the hell were we thinking ?
i am sure it seemed like a good idea at the time .
see you soon . oh , and i appreciate the distraction back there .
hell , they hardly even noticed us .
yeah , jimmy ?
. . . every time you tell that story , you stop there . that is not how it ended . i was five when my dad got shot .
i know . but that is how it should have ended . your dad and mom , riding off into a new life , growing old together , happy .
sounds like he was a hell of a man .
that he was .
they are making him a hero now .
saved a lot of folk from the railroad .
but he killed a lot of men , too .
cannot argue that .
so what was he ?
i think . . . he was just a real interesting fella to have around .
yeah jimmy ?
how much of that story is true ?
everything but the boring parts .
a fair number , ma .
say your prayers ?
he is a good christian and he killed yankees . jesus told me that made him an all right boy .
we are just fine , thank you , sir .
somebody s in a vengeful smiting mood today .
boys ?
we know , ma . now we got to get you to doc mimms .
take care of each other , boys . you say your prayers .
shush .
you were little jesse james when you left .
but you got big !
if there s anything we can do for you , dr . mimms . we want to help .
mmmm .
nuh huh . . .
i have been on my back two weeks . i am sick of it .
you are sick of my company ?
no ! i mean , of course not . no .
teasing you is completely unfair .
what you do to me is unfair . the teasing , i mean .
i should not tease a hero .
what ?
everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued cole . we are all so proud of you , jesse . and not a single farm s been sold to the railroad since . you are everybody s hero .
i was not the only one risking my neck that day .
so you are saying i should leave you alone and go spend time with jimmy younger ?
unfair . you are completely unfair .
you did not want to farm ?
i was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate .
a river pirate .
arr . hand over your jewels , missy .
thank god you grew out of that . you did grow out of that , did not you ?
mostly . it would be an all right life , for a bachelor .
you planning on being a bachelor your whole life , jesse james ?
not if i find the right girl .
and that is this right girl like ?
smart . funny . bossy . always makes me think she is two steps ahead of me . and big buck teeth .
where will you find such a girl ?
honestly , you would do if only you had the buck teeth .
sparkling rocks ?
little ones .
is this one of frank s shakespeare poems you are trying to quote ?
yep .
were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting ?
i have been planning on kissing you for a very long time .
frank and me have to go away for a while .
me neither .
let the law
laws do not touch men like thaddeus rains . only justice does .
whose justice ? yours or god s ? when will you stop ?
when my name makes them cry in their sleep . when i have brought them to ashes .
jesse . what are you thinking ? there are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county !
i had to see you . i am getting married .
she is the most wonderful woman in the world . cannot get her out of my mind .
that is . . . wonderful . it is just . . . i thought . . .
she is beautiful . smart . and has the biggest . . . buck teeth in all of missouri .
that is why i picked it . we can start a whole new life down here .
are you going to be happy here , mr . james ? without all that excitement ?
i have got you . you keep me busy . i figure we will get over to the hotel . . . get checked in , cleaned up . . . then i would like to do something i have been thinking about for a long time .
now wait a minute . there are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding .
hmm what ?
but the life of the james gang was not all robbing and shooting and killing , for these young missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies . . . especially the handsome and charismatic jesse james .
blazing guns of the west . true stories of jesse james . only a dime in the hotel lobby .
let me see that .
oh , i am not finished . when he sauntered into a saloon , his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold , the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple . as i said . hmm .
now , sweetie , y all would not go believing one of them silly dime novels , would you ?
jesse , have you ever noticed that when you are trying to charm your way out of trouble , your accent gets all farm boy ?
aw , shucks , ma am . . .
stop it . this is just sad .
swimming . swimming is good .
what ?
if you do not see it , it is not real . . .
yes ma am .
i cannot believe i had to blow up a train for you .
you are a hell of a woman .
do not swear .
yes ma am .
i will explain on the way .
but i like the presidential suite .
oh , it is a similar room . but the hotel is in washington d . c . you are not going to get a fair trial down here , in front of a jury of jesse james sympathizers .
so i will get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by thaddeus rains ?
that is the idea .
not that day . i am guilty of many things , but that was mr . thaddeus rains and parker , that day .
pity .
last february ?
mmm .
you had all those cattle there , so i would think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive ?
yes ?
the cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town .
damn .
i went myself to oversee the operation . did not help much .
no , that one was close . a couple fellas quit after that one .
i figured .
was it worth it ?
should have just killed thaddeus rains and been done with it .
that is what i would have done .
i am not hanged yet .
you cocky little bastard .
ahh , you will miss me .
no , i will hang you . but i may miss you just a bit .
he is too important , james . they will set the army on you . you and your wife .
thanks .
i would just as soon kill you , jesse james . but chasing you takes up too much of my time .
fair enough .
you do not think god will mind , do you ?
i could have lied i suppose , but i want this marriage to be legal . i just want you to know , i am trying to start a new life here . i am depending on your . . .
discretion ? sir , i am a man of the cloth .
thank you .
who needs to repair a leaky church roof .
right here in church ?
communion .
i am the same age you were when you went off to war .
and the same age web was . no .
no .
yeah . hey , are you drinking whisky ? you are too young to be drinking whisky .
not too young to shoot a man , not to young to drink .
i guess so .
i was always jealous web mimms got to go off and fight with you and cole . now it is my turn .
tonight ? why , i am just getting ready to turn on the younger charm .
you been with a girl ever ?
hell yeah ! i been with . . . uh , not exactly . it is just , i do not want to get one of these paid ladies , you know ?
i think so .
you and frank and cole , and even bob , get all these girls because you are good looking and famous . you do not have to pay . they just look at me like i am the baby brother . do not tell anyone , okay jesse ?
i swear .
tell you something else . i cannot drink that good neither . i am going to go outside and throw up .
you do that .
it is his money . he is putting up the payroll out of his own fortune . you do want to hurt thaddeus rains , do not you jesse ?
this time we will make an exception .
jesse , you explain to lyla . my girl , you know , from that time . . .
you are gonna tell her when you are resting up in bed with her , jimmy .
i hope you do not mind , jesse james told me your name .
oh , you were talking to jesse .
yes , but just so i could find out who you were .
i hope i am not being too forward .
not at all .
i just though you were awful cute .
thank you , miss ?
lyla devereux .
gosh , that is a pretty name . buy you a drink ?
could we go upstairs and talk ? it is so loud down here .
why do not we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk ?
that is so gentlemanly of you .
really ?
do not talk about it much , though .
i am doing you folks a favor
it is not my job to relax . i have put men facing out both ways down main street , so nobody can ride in shooting . i have got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case .
they had to be dealt with !
by burning down their homes ?
they donate money to farmers , to churches . rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of maddox so much money they were able to build a school .
move you fools !
and it is my pleasure to be here .
really !
no ! it is not my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their pathetic little mudholes so that i may build the greatest railroad that this country has ever seen !
i can completely understand your distress , sir .
two weeks ago , we managed to arrange to have the army hang one of the local farmers .
good .
unfortunately not , sir . a gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows . not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers , the redoubtable mr . alan pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident .
leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers .
yes sir .
just perfect .
a further impediment is that the army garrison has been ordered to move on from liberty . we will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers .
you see the army leaving and you see the loss of a tool . i see a power void to be filled . as we have the most power , we may move with impunity .
i see . i will get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight .
i will teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress .
how much did they get from the safe ?
thirty five thousand , sir . coins and currency . and the delay from the miles of destroyed track
i will kill them for blowing up my railway !
to be precise , they did not blow up the tracks .
then who did ? !
we did .
what is going on here , man ?
we should go burn that school to the ground , sir !
i look forward to seeing it .
sir ?
what is that ?
what , sir ?
oh , that . i will let jenkins explain .
i remember you .
not such a menace now , is he , pinkerton ?
not to mention my men who lost their lives .
oh no , i would have done that . but i would have made sure i killed them , too .
i want them arrested and hanged !
would a jury around here convict their own ? i think not . we are beginning an interesting game here , mr . rains .
this is no game .
i am afraid our adversaries do not agree .
it is a nice piece of writing .
the gang made off with thirty five thousand dollars and also destroyed the thaxton switch construction , meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land ! who wrote this ! ? i will see him hanged every tuesday for a month !
oh , that is the best part .
i am losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers !
hardly farmers . i have done some checking . all these were in the war . these men know sabotage , tactics , and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them . they are disciplined , well trained and have a charismatic leader . if i were to design the perfect outlaw band , this gang is what i would create .
so you cannot tell me anything ?
it is going to be a long winter .
all of the james gang s encounters have been with local law enforcement who , quite frankly , are no match for this group s cunning .
i cannot believe this .
and there are some towns in missouri where james and his men can walk openly , as heroes .
i demand action .
no , you demand results . they are not the same thing . and if you want results , you will let me do my job as i see fit . unless of course , you want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it ?
cannot you tell me anything ?
it is going to be a long spring .
no .
in english , pinkerton .
there are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed .
can you put men at all four ?
no need . i have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank .
what is that ?
why , their intense hatred of you , of course .
vengeance .
what ? oh , i am . . . busy .
listen , you are dating luis , he is in arizona . you are fucking me , and we have not made plans . what could you possibly be up to tonight ?
stop it . i am . . .
on a lot of lithium ?
waiting for luis to call me . he said he would call tonight . oh do not be difficult , patrick .
you should come have dinner with me . courtney but when ?
am i confused or were we talking about tonight ?
ummm . . yeah . luis is calling me tonight . i need to be home for that .
pumpkin ?
yes ?
pumpkin you are dating an asshole .
uh huh .
pumpkin you are dating the biggest dickweed in new york .
i know . stop it .
pumpkin , you are dating a tumbling , tumbling dickweed .
patrick do not call me pumpkin anymore , okay ? i have to go .
courtney ? dinner ?
i cannot .
i am thinking dorsia .
dorsia s nice .
nice ?
you like it there , do not you ?
the question is do you like it , courtney ? and will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight .
okay . yeah . what time ?
eight ?
pick me up ?
sounds like i will have to . do not fall asleep , okay ? wear something fabulous . dorsia , remember ?
is that donald trump s car ?
oh god , patrick . shut up .
you know , courtney , you should take some more lithium . or have a diet coke . some caffeine might get you out of this slump .
i just want to have a child . just . . . two . . . perfect . . . children . . .
champagne on the rocks . oh could i have that with a twist ? she starts to sink back in her chair and bateman leans over and pulls her back up .
are we here ?
yes .
this is dorsia ?
yes , dear .
mmmm . . . thanks , patrick .
yes , luis is a despicable twit . i hate him .
is it a what ?
pull out .
i am ignoring you .
pull out , goddamnit !
what do you want , courtney ?
turn the light on .
patrick . turn on the light . he turns on the light .
it is a plain end , see ? so ?
take it off .
why ?
because you have to leave half an inch at the tip to catch the force of the ejaculate ! bateman i am getting out of here . where is your lithium ?
well , it is not a turn on for me . i have a promotion coming to me . i do not want to get aids .
oh god , just get it over with .
maybe .
dinner at the river cafe . au bar afterwards , maybe .
that is nice .
you and . . . luis ?
we were supposed to have dinner at tad and maura s , but you know how luis is . . .
i never knew you smoked .
you never noticed .
you look marvelous . there s nothing to say . you are going to marry luis . next week , no less .
is not that special ? patrick ?
yes , courtney ?
yes ?
nothing .
you just have not been looking .
would you like to see my apartment ?
i am not supposed to . but i can make an exception .
do you take american express ?
actually , that is none of your business , christie , hut i can assure you it certainly was not cheap .
oh this will not be anything like last time , i promise .
i do not think so .
alright .
well , i actually might need a little surgery after last time .
really ?
my friend told me i should maybe even get a lawyer .
oh , lawyers are so complicated do not do that . here .
it is not that nice .
do . . . what .
get married . have a wedding .
evelyn ?
yes , darling ?
is your evian spiked ?
we should do it .
no i cannot take the time off work .
your father practically owns the company . you can do anything you like , silly .
i do not want to talk about it .
well , you hate that job anyway . why do not you just quit ? you do not have to work .
because i . . . want . . . to . . . fit . . . in .
hi . pat bateman .
oh god , patrick . why price ? price ?
he is rich .
everybody s rich .
he is good looking .
everybody s good looking , patrick .
he has a great body
everybody has a great body now .
no . i am not . why should i ?
your hairline looks like it is receding .
it is not .
i think , evelyn , that we have . . . lost touch .
my need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be , um , corrected , but i have no other way to fulfill my needs .
talk about what , patrick ? what is there to talk about ?
it is over , evelyn . it is all over
touchy , touchy . i am sorry i brought the wedding up . let s just avoid the issue , alright ? now , are we having coffee ?
i am fucking serious . it is fucking over . us . this is no joke . i do not think we should see each other anymore .
but your friends are my friends . my friends are your friends . i do not think it would work . you have a little something on your upper lip .
i know that your friends are my friends . i have thought about that . you can have them .
yes , i am .
but what about the past ? our past ?
we never really shared one .
you are inhuman .
i am . . . in touch with humanity . evelyn , i am sorry . you are just not terribly important to me .
i know my behavior is . . . erratic sometimes .
oh god , i cannot believe this .
i am leaving now . i have assessed the situation and i am going .
i am just leaving .
but where ?
i have to return some videotapes .
what are the rules for a sweater vest ?
good coloring .
that is bone . and the lettering is something called silian rail .
nice .
i know her . i knew her .
how did you guess ?
girls dig bateman . he is cq . you are total cq , bateman .
thanks , guy , but . . . she is got a lousy personality .
ed gein ? maitre d at canal bar ?
no , serial killer , wisconsin in the fifties . he was an interesting guy .
is that all you ever have to contribute , van patten ? what about fucking dinner ?
no .
i am looking for . . . paul owengs . . . place .
no , he does not .
are you sure ?
you saw the ad in the times ?
no . yes . i mean yes , i did . in the times . but . . . does not paul owen still live here ?
there was no ad in the times .
but i think . . . i want to know what happened here .
do not make any trouble . please . i suggest you go .
i will not . . . do not worry .
face it the japanese will own most of this country by the end of the s .
yes , naturally .
bateman killing owen and the escort girls ? oh that s fabulous . that is rich . . .
what exactly do you mean ?
the message you left .
but wait , harold , what do you mean ?
davis . i am not one to bad mouth anyone , your joke was amusing . but come on , man , you had one fatal flaw batemangs such a dork , such a boring , spineless lightweight , that i could not fully appreciate it . i was not fooled for a second . now , if you would said price , or mcdermott . . . otherwise , it was amusing . now , let s have lunch or dinner or something . hilarious , davis . a killer .
what are you talking about ? bateman is what ?
oh christ . he can barely pick up an escort girl , let alone . . . what was it you said he did to her ?
wait . stop . you do not seem to understand . you are not really comprehending any of this . i killed him . i did it , carnes . i am patrick bateman . i chopped owengs fucking head off . i tortured dozens of girls . the whole message i left on your machine was true .
excuse me . i really must he going .
no ! listen , do not you know who i am ? i am not davis , i am patrick bateman ! i talk to you on the phone all the time ! do not you recognize me ? you are my lawyer .
but that is simply not possible . and i do not find this funny anymore .
it never was supposed to he ! why is not it possible ?
it is just not .
why not , you stupid bastard ?
no , you . . . did not ?
now , if you will excuse me .
lucky , i guess .

i want to get high off this bateman , not sprinkle it on my fucking all bran .
calm down . let s do it anyway
i guess you are right . . . that is , if the faggot in the next stall thinks it is okay !
like what ?
well , we have to end apartheid for one . and slow down the nuclear arms race , stop terrorism and world hunger . but we cannot ignore our social needs . either we have to stop people from abusing the welfare system . we have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain womengs freedom of choice .

patrick , you re a lunatic .
come on . do not you find christie attractive ?
let s not get lewd . i am in no mood to have a lewd conversation .
come on . i think it would be a turn on .
does he do this all the time ?
no ! i am not a lesbian . why do you think i would be into that ?
well , you went to sarah lawrence for one thing .
those are sarah lawrence guys , patrick . you are making me feel weird .
you actually listen to whitney houston ? you actually have a whitney houston cd ? more than one ?
no , i am sorry . i should have made an appointment . was that anything important ?
oh that ? just mulling over business problems . examining opportunities . . . exchanging rumors . . . spreading gossip .
hi . pat bateman . nice to meet you .
i am sorry to barge in on you like this . but i was supposed to talk to luis carruthers and he was not in and . . . well , you are here , so . . . i know how busy you guys can get .
i have been hired by meredith powell to investigate the disappearance of paul owen .
you are not with the fbi or anything , are you ?
nothing like that . i am just a private investigator .
ah , i see . . . yes . paul s disappearance . . . yes .
so it is nothing that official . i just have some basic questions . about paul owen . about yourself
coffee ?
no . i am okay .
perrier ? san pellegrino ?
no , i am okay .
mr . kimball a bottle of san pelle
oh no , i am okay .
it is no problem
the disappearance of paul owen .
oh right . well , i have not heard anything about the disappearance or anything . . . not on page six at least .
i think his family wants this kept quiet .
understandable . lime ?
no , really . i am okay .
you sure ? i can always get you a lime .
shoot .
how old are you ?
twenty six . i will be twenty seven in october .
where did you go to school ?
harvard . the harvard business school .
your address ?
fifty five west eighty first street . the american gardens building .
nice . very nice .
thanks .
who do you ask ?
you seem . . . nervous .
i know . i am sorry .
no , i guess it is okay .
you sure ?
no problem .
well . . .
i am . . . at a loss . he was part of that whole . . . yale thing , you know .
yale thing ?
what do you mean . . . yale thing ?
he led what i suppose was an orderly life . he . . . ate a balanced diet .
what kind of man was he ? besides . . . the information you have just given .
i hope i am not being cross examined here .
do you feel that way ?
no . not really .
where did paul hang out ?
hang . . . out ?
yeah . you know . . . hang out .
let me think . the newport . harry s . fluties . endochine . nell s . comell club . the new york yacht club . the regular places .
he had a yacht ?
no , he just hung out there .
and where did he go to school ?
i just wanted to know if you know . bateman before yale ? if i remember correctly , saint paul s . . . listen , i just . . . i just want to help .
we were both seven in .
so was i .
do you have any witnesses or fingerprints ?
well , there s a message on his answering machine saying he went to london .
well , maybe he did , huh ?
his girlfriend does not think so .
but . . . has anyone seen him in london ?
actually , yes .
hmmm .
well , i have had a hard time getting an actual verification . a stephen hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there , but i checked it out and what happened is , he mistook a hubert ainsworth for paul , so . . .
oh .
was he involved at all , do you think , in occultism or satan worship ?
what ?
i know it sounds like a lame question , but in new jersey i know this sounds like a lame question , but last month i do not know if you have heard about this , but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts
yikes ! no . paul was not into that . he followed a balanced diet and
yeah , i know , and was into that whole yale thing .
no .
had his apartment been burglarized ?
no , it actually had not . toiletries were missing . a suit was gone . so was some luggage . that is it .
i mean no one s dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything , right ?
no , not yet . as i said , we are not sure . but . . . basically no one has seen or heard anything .
that is so typical , is not it ?
it is just strange . one day someone s walking around , going to work , alive , and then . . .
nothing .
people just . . . disappear .
the earth just opens up and swallows people .
eerie . really eerie .
is not the four seasons a little far uptown ? i mean are not you going to be late ?
uh , no . there s one . . . down here .
oh really ? i did not know that .
absolutely , i am with you .
great , and thanks for your , uh , time , mr . bateman .
don .
so . . . you hang out here a lot ?
uh , yes . . . i mean . . . whenever necessary . you know .
h no . informal conversations , mostly . that is that , stoli ?
yeah . no finlandia , as usual . fucking dump .
too true . you know , bateman people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they are in a relaxed setting , do not you think ?
dan , great to see you again . like i said , you need anything at all , i am your man . i do not envy your job . i mean owen was a . . . complex man .
yeah , gone into rehab . shame . is he a suspect ?
not really .
god . . . i guess . . . i was probably returning videotapes .
wait . that is not what i have got .
what ?
that is not the information i have received .
well . . . i . . . wait . . . what information have you received ?
let s see . . . that you were with
well , i could he wrong .
well . . . when was the last time you were with paul owen ?
we had . . . gone to a new musical called . . . oh africa , brave africa . it was . . . a laugh riot . . . and that is about it . i think we had dinner at orso s . no , petaluma . no , orso s . the . . . last time i physically saw him was . . . at an automated teller . i cannot remember which . . . just one that was near , um , nell s .
patrick , please . i hope i have been informative . long day a bit scattered .
listen , i am a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when i have sorted out all this information ?
great , yes , i would like that .
and if you could try and pin down where you were the night of owengs disappearance , it would make my job a lot easier .
absolutely . i am with you on that one .
not a big music fan , eh ?
no , i like music . just they are huey s too . . . black sounding . for me .
well , to each his own . so lunch , thursday ? i will call your secretary about reservations .
i will be there .
not in the mood , i guess .
but . . . everyone orders the hash browns here . i mean it is have you been here before ?
yes , of course . the hash browns are delicious . i am just . . . not . . . ordering them .
suit yourself , i guess .
i am not really sure . i had a shower . . . and some sorbet ?
i think maybe you have got your dates mixed up .
but how ? where do you place paul that night ?
according to his date book , and this was verified by his secretary , he had dinner with . . . marcus halberstam .
and ?
i have questioned him .
marcus ?
yes . and he denies it . though at first he could not be sure .
but marcus denied it ?
yes .
well , does marcus have an alibi ?
yes .
i checked it out . it is clean .
oh . kimball now where were you ?
where was marcus ?
he was not with paul owen .
so who was he with ?
he was at atlantis with craig mcdermott , frederick dibble , harry newman , george butner and you .
personally i think the guy went a little nutso . split town for a while . maybe he did go to london . sightseeing . drinking . whatever . anyway , i am pretty sure he will turn up sooner or later . i mean , to think that one of his friends killed him , for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous . is not that right , patrick ?
it is cold out , too , is not it ?
i am so hungry .
why do not you get a job ? if you are so hungry , why do not you get a job ?
i lost my job . . .
why ? were you drinking ? is that why you lost it ? insider trading ? just joking . no , really were you drinking on the job ?
i am so hungry .
i am not . . .
you are not what ? qualified for anything else ?
i am hungry
i know that , i know that . jeez , you are like a broken record . i am trying to help you .
i am hungry .
listen , do you think it is fair to take money from people who do have jobs ? from people who do work ?
what am i gonna do ?
listen , that is your name ?
al .
speak up . come on .
al .
get a goddamn job , al . you have got a negative attitude . that is that is stopping you . you have got to get your act together . i will help you .
you re so kind , mister . you are kind . you are a kind man . i can tell .
shhhh . . . it is okay .
please . . . i don know what to do . i am so cold .
do , you know how bad you smell ? the stench , my god .
i cannot . . . i cannot find a shelter
you reek . you reek of . . . shit . do you know that ? goddammit , al look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot . al . . . i am sorry .
i have been great . and you ?
it is . . . it is . . . all right .
really ? that is interesting . not great ?
oh well , you know .
and how is cecilia ? she is a great girl .
oh yes . i am very lucky .
yeah , well , you are late .
hey , i am a child of divorce . give me a break hmmm , i see they have omitted the pork loin with lime jello .
we should have gone to dorsia . i could have gotten us a table .
nobody goes there anymore .
i could tell you that , halberstam , but then i would have to kill you .
cecelia is , well . . . you know
evelyn . great ass . goes out with that loser patrick bateman . what a dork .
another martini , paul ?
two hundred and fifty . very reasonable . let s leave a big tip , shall we ? my place hr a nightcap ?
no , man . i am gonna bail .
come on , you dumb son of a bitch . i have got a preview of the barneys catalogue and a bottle of absolut waiting for us .
they are okay . bateman their early work was a little too new wave for my taste . but then sports came out in , i think they really came into their own , commercially and artistically .
yes , owen ?
why are there copies of the style section all over the place ? do you have a dog ? a chow or something ?
no , owen .
is that a raincoat ?
yes , it is .
you will look like you consciously worked for the look .
good point . excuse me , gentlemen .
what shit ? now where do we have reservations at ? i mean i am not really hungry , but i would like to have reservations somewhere .
i do not believe it . he looks so . . . normal . he seems so . . . out of it . so . . . undangerous .
some guys are just born cool , i guess .
they still have to give em refreshments laced with mind altering drugs .
you are a fanatic .
gonna wait outside .
make him ?
you know what i mean .
you know what he is like . he just wants to work on stuff that is cool .
you do not wanna move , do you ?
i can paint anywhere .
anything ? that is not even credible . if he wants to go up there ? to check it out ? i think you should encourage him . it is his life . but everybody s treating him like this valuable object . you are hurting your own case .
c mon , how often do you talk to somebody who s been on the cover of time . three of four times .
then you have gotta ask him about that .
if he is really a bully , he will not cop to it , anyway .
bully ? are we talking about gary boyd ? or your dad .
but he is not quite the same guy anymore . do not get your hopes too high ?
i think that is great , milo . i do .
. . . but ?
did not you visit the campus ?
i forgot . that is why you have to help me decide .
no way . you have this destiny .
c mon , i would not have a destiny without you . my destiny would be dying at . from eating
do not bring that up . like a different girlfriend would would have let you die ?
you saved my life in alot of ways .
prob ly waiting by the phone for outpost to call . we will leave it for him ?
we are not gonna let it .
milo ! what about ?
that is what i need to ask you . you know you cannot keep anything from me .
he gave me some new code fixes this morning . i said , did you really do this just today ? cause i was impressed . he said what are you implying ?
what would it mean , anyway ? if he did not write it ?
that is what i am asking myself . does he have some genius stowed away ? why not let him write skywire . not saying it makes sense .
i know , i know .
if you cannot deal with him on that basis , you better get a new counselor .
is not that extreme ?
that is extreme is what that er doctor said when he pumped your stomach . eat another sesame seed and that is it .
you are right . it is a working relationship . do not know what i was expecting .
teddy was killed last night .
what are you what ?
it was a hate crime .
i do not know what i am saying . maybe maybe they hired those guys .
i cannot see outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that .
i do not know ! i just know it was teddy s code . all these ideas flying in from everywhere . you know how he says any kid working in his garage can put us out of business ? it is like they know what every kid s doing .
they hack into people s programs ?
nobody does work like this on line . it is in your pc , or in a mainframe . self contained . they would have to be , like , watching people . physically . oh jesus .
you are scaring me . i think we should just go .
go where ? you cannot get away from people like this .
like this ? it is gary you are talking about .
you think i do not know that ?
milo . why would he
how should i know ? solving a problem , i guess . or needing to control everything . i do not know . i have gotta get in there .
even if all this were true . there are other buildings . all of them filled with computers and
it is the only one with dishes on the roof . the studio s a front . that is why they keep postponing its opening . . . . gotta get in there .
milo , you told me those doj agents are all over the place . how could they hope to hide a surveillance post ? and how can you get in there , anyway ? with the cameras and the swipe cards
i cannot just walk away !
you cannot just walk in , either .
they stop the construction work at six or seven . the parking lot s mostly clear by two or three in the morning . even the early geeks do not get there before five .
is it two ? or is it three ? have you ever really noticed ?
. . . whaddo i do ?
so you believe me ?
nothing .
nothing ?
. . . why ?
remember lyle barton ?
i remember .
after i broke into which was insane , thank god they did not catch me ! i just drove around . trying to figure out what possessed me . you know what ? i have been putting my own guilt on gary .
guilt ?
if i would stayed down there , maybe this would not have happened .
poor baby . you know that is not true .
. . . different ?
okay , yeah . i did something naughty . . . there s this amazing comix store in seattle . to tell you the truth , i did it once or twice at stanford . guess i cannot keep anything from you . . .
what ?
why does not he ask us to his party . he is never even met you .
he has thousands of employees , milo
it is for the museum . he knows you are a painter . if anybody should be invited
milo
i know you think i am too attached to him , but still . i am close to gary . and you are the most meaningful person in my life . i am going back to the comix place , why should i be killing myself .
milo , you
i went to see the skywire model in gary s office . you know . just to hold it again .
just shut up ?
look at me ! i am gonna change .
yeah ? give me a goodbye kiss .
. . . what ?
i know you . you are gonna run back to work right after dinner . i want my kiss now .
do not we have any chopsticks ?
oh , right . hold on .
great .
it is gonna get cold .
right . wait . a toast .
you are just afraid to eat it .
no .
not like him , is it ? to do a thing like that without telling you . you are not losing your hold on him , are you ?
he will tell me when he gets home .
that will be a test , will not it ?
instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl . fire her . or something .
lisa s an extremely valuable member of the skywire team . we have got our eyes on her . you keep yours on milo .
prick .
he was not acting ?
i do not think he knows how .
right . . . that is that mean again ?
beggar . we are at a disadvantage with outpost . our experts are not as smart as theirs . sometimes we cannot tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly . we need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights . i am taking a shot in the dark , here . i can offer you , a year , a buick . i am hoping you have got a feeling it is the right thing to do .
it is just i kind of feel the need to do something with my ability . create something . . .
like i said shot in the dark .
. . . it is milo , is not it ?
yes sir . i need to talk to you .
give me two seconds with lacy here ? go on in , i will not be a moment .
yeah . hi . thank you for seeing me .
have a seat .
i am . i am , sir .
my friend , my best friend , teddy , was killed in silicon valley .
my goodness .
it was racially motivated . he is chinese . he was . and . . . i know sometimes the fbi gets involved with that . do not they ?
if there s a civil rights violation . but generally we let the local police and da do their work first .
i just wanna help bring these guys to justice . they are neo nazis .
let me look into it , see that is being done . frankly , it is not my area .
just did not know who else to talk to .
and outpost ? you are happy there ?
yes sir .
thought if i relocated it could help my case . i am writing programs for the local public access station . where any whack job with bucks gets his own show ? god , does it suck . can you help me ?
sure , i will see what i can do .
forgot to introduce you . i have a girlfriend .
you cannot pre empt yoga , that is our biggest show .
brian ! you wanna be a big deal , do not you ? that is your dream in life .
no . but you can write your own ticket in the valley after this . we are gonna bring down outpost .
what ?
what would they ever do for you ?
great . great ! we need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door
what ? !
wanna be a part of history ?
gimme the coordinates ?
is it your dish ?
he is working backwards , too . let s do number five ?
you should have called a few times to bug me about your job prospects .
outpost was his baby , sure . on the other hand , we just learned gary boyd owns the skywire satellites . personally .
outpost does not own em .
that would change with a criminal indictment .
there s no hard evidence he knew about this . anybody who could implicate him seems to have vanished .
is not there a stigma ? bankrolling this guy ?
stigma ? larry ! billion buys you some slack in this world .
and the kid who wrote skywire then gave it away ? they are calling him the digital robin hood .
milo . surprised he is not your guest .
we tried !
you better believe everybody s trying to sign him up .
oh hi .
he is pretty tight with his family .
we could move em up here .
he just likes to write code . he is bummed there s so much secrecy and competition , everybody trying to own everything .
i think they call him the houseman . cause guard sounds too weird .
milo ? gary boyd . i am hoping you and your friend can come up here . we have made some amazing strides in digital convergence . i would love to show them to you .
you would ? wow . when would we come ? think he hung up .
would you like a coke or something ?
oh . no thanks .
there s a rumor going around , maybe you have heard it .
low enough to relay internet traffic .
among other things . . . we know convergence is the real super highway all the pc s , tv s , phones , etc . linked together . why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky ?
skywire .
it needs a more object oriented language . this does not scale , does it ?
you would have to start practically from scratch . but this is all you would be working on . no marketing meetings , no product seminars . we cannot waste the time . half the valley s working on convergence . so are media conglomerates , cable companies , phone companies . cannot finish second , milo . there is no second . . . now what would you like to ask me ?
i do !
yeah ? i wanna feel like i did when i wrote that . but i am , that is in cyber years . i look at you and see the things that got me here . but somehow got away .
okay . i am gary .
. . . do i ?
somebody said i am just another philistine . with reproductions .
that is insane . you are ahead of your time .
that is what i told her . my wife .
do not spend too much time searching . you ever vetted somebody s old code before ? it is a different skill . stay close to the surface . the best hidden secrets are in plain sight . you know the best place to hide a leaf , right ? in a tree .
maybe i am going too fast .
too fast ? at least four companies are on the verge of workable convergence systems , milo , they
take a look at this . slightly different approach .
you are making me young again .
well you sent for me .
right . . . right .
what are you implying .
nothing !
i am sure .
the purpose of this company is not to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath . but the software business is binary you are a zero or a one . being obsessive is not a crime . it is a character trait .
definitely .
were the flags for teddy ?
just once . guess i was worried we did not have anything to talk about , since work was off limits . non disclosure .
did you ?
talk about work ? never !
i meant did you find other stuff to
oh . yeah .
you have been coming in early .
it helps . alice said it would help . to focus on something . wouldo not know what i would do without her .
, . but they are real short lines . just came out that way .
the wrong place ?
the answer s not in the box . it is in the band .
you look a little tired .
i am okay . it is going well !
have a look ?
sure .
. . . my dad was a compulsive gambler . only he did not think he was . that applied to guys who did not have a system . losers , who played games of chance . he could read people , so chance had nothing to do with it . no matter how deep a hole he dug himself , he would give you the whole speech . and you would better not point out the obvious . his creditors would catch up to him . loan sharks or whatever . he would wake us in the middle of the night . off we would go , again .
what would you tell the kids ? at your new school ? you had to come up with a good story , right ?
. . . worse ?
cause he was a liar . and i hated him . get your head out of that machine , wise up to the real world . the more he mocked me the deeper i went . cause if being savvy meant being like him guess that is why i am kind of clueless , even now . did not cultivate my conniving side . not sure i even have one .
do not be so hard on yourself . with a brain like yours , you could connive with the best of em i bet .
sorry about the late notice . . .
i could not do it at work cause of security or at home for obvious reasons .
i am not much good at handwriting . or parties .
oh , that is right . you are clueless .
you see that is hanging on the wall ?
i do know , gary . i feel the same way . i thought i was coming here for a job . but it is meant a lot more .
i do know . you focus on the big problem . but somewhere down the chain , something breaks down . something gets destroyed . at first it is upsetting . you feel you have lost control .
start up not miles from here . kid s on prozac .
maybe we should all get on it .
there may be a little less trust after your outburst .
nothing does . still . i want him to like me .
gary , do not worry , we
just do what i am asking !
longitude degrees minutes
let s go .
longitude
wait . . . he knows .
what ?
knows i am altering the coordinates . let s jump to .
gary ?
just do it .
in exchange for endowments . they should just drop the pretense and name the schools after em .
you do ?
i mean , it is your life .
you are naive . look at your employment contract you cannot work anywhere else in this field for at least few years . not that i do not miss you .
just thought his work should go on .
he was on the verge of something , too . he was gonna show us the next day . he said the answer s not in the box , it is in the band . know what it means ?
it is only meaningful when you have got , lines of code to back it up .
man , could he write code . totally elegant . he had his own style .
those really weird , short lines .
we will come up with the next big thing .
. . . you wanna work here ?
got out of my other commitment .
cool .
unlikely . all cameras are frozen . do we call randy and phil ? tell em there may have been a break in ?
not yet . love to bust my ass cause i am not in frigging mensa . i swear to god , it is that kid milo , i told em so in the first place , but they did not even wanna hear about it . let s run a printout on card entries .
keep looking .
what are we looking for ?
any irregularity in the pattern .
let s get him in here .
they know . just they do not trust me with it . so we will get the evidence , first , ask questions later .
i am calling gary .
where we going ?
i launched skywire . just pray the last set of coordinates milo sent me connected us to gary s satellite .
you know my name .
you know mine .
you are famous around here .
i am getting a teacher s pet rep .
i would not worry about it . you have gotta figure most people around here were their teachers pets .
. . . were you ?
we moved around so much i barely knew my teachers .
me too ! were you an army brat or something ?
. . . something like that . yeah .
did not mean to pry . i just have this theory . some of us who got to good at this ? we were escaping something .
no , i know what you mean . i used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers . least they make sense . sometimes you think they have betrayed you . like a person would . but then you see , no , you just missed a step . you can go back and make it all work .
graphical interfaces . for skywire ? i am s posed to coordinate with you .
show me .
yeah ? i ran it for lots of platforms , ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to
no . please .
there is no second place . plus every time i get jammed up , gary has an inspiration . is it like that with your counselor ?
mine s not the ceo . he barely remembers to take a shower .
right , right . but does he ever just , like , hand you code ?
maybe once . i re wrote it , anyway .
you are compulsive .
mmm more like i have a little trouble . trusting people .
why s that ?
long story . not that interesting .
then and now . but not right now .
she saved my life .
why would you do a thing like
you thought about it too . you have been suspicious for a while . but it is not happening in there . it is happening in the day care .
the day care ?
but why would they ?
you know . there is no second place . and that is the risk ? the killings are undetectable , they are hand tailored , they make sense . i mean , they are in the information business . they have scenarios for all of us , too . in case we find out too much .
oh yeah ?
they would frame him .
he is out of prison ?
they are already watching you . if they had to , they would give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout . he would wake up not even remembering his act of revenge .
hmm ?
i always felt if a boy i liked ever found out he would run . he would think i was unclean .
no , no . never .
they have got this guy in the doj , maybe others . we tell the wrong person , it is over .
who can we trust ?
there s always a logical answer you just have to define the question .
there are so many disinformation sites about gary already . where he has devil s horns or they crop him in with saddam hussein .
right . but gary s tied in to a lot of media conglomerates . have to be careful who we pick .
we could cross reference a data base on media ownership . but not on our own computers . not even at home .
certainly not at my happy home .
what about minutes .
yeah , they dig stuff like this . cbs news has partnered with outpost information systems in a cable news network due to launch fall of .
but still , you cannot say cbs would not love to break something like
say there s just one mole working there , like barton at the doj . how do we know he is not the guy we have contacted ? or she ? or the guy she works for ?
time warner has a per cent stake in gary s set top device . that also takes out cnn . ge joins outpost in new venture , which means nbc is out . disney joins outpost , abc is out . outpost and newscorp in new deal , fox is out . any of these places could have a mole . or all of em . it is like a a continuous loop . we can go to some alternative press place that , people read , get them and us killed . but anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something gary s got a finger in !
what ?
he is got satellites up . he is got dishes on top of . he is building this mega network for skywire . let s use it .
a what ?
it is how on line services push logos they wanna sell you . you do not ask for em , they just appear . have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house . and then the quality of the broadcast would not exactly be digital , that is months away .
but they would still get the idea , right ?
you would have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop . maybe some audio , too . to tie it all in to gary . how long would that take you ?
it is a standard gui . once i have got a concept , it is maybe three day s work .
gary knows i am close on skywire . we have to do this fast .
before they kill somebody else , too .
oh , man . i would have to get into gary s house . to get the satellite positions .
you mean break in ?
i do not know
and what if the broadcast dishes on top of are not hot yet ? you said the place is not finished .
i thought the worst they would do is fire me . who knew they took termination so literally ?
oh . i liked you . i was checking you out .
cause their apartments might be bugged ?
what would he say ?
a beautiful geek ? what are the chances ?
gary .
the dishes are juiced up , too .
thank god .
milo ? shrot suspects somebody broke into . i was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts .
they know i broke in . alice helped me . shrot s not one of them . he is blundering into this on his own .
he does not know about the day care .
hardly anybody does , that is the beauty part . no cameras , the doj does not bother with it , it is accessed by a tunnel they boast about . you know the best place to hide a leaf ?
yeah , that is old , in a tree .
oh .
milo ? what if shrot notices somebody entered the day care at four a . m . ? and tells them about it ?
perfect . how am i gonna get away from the party long enough to
you could always say you have to go the bathroom .
that is lame , is not it ?
you will come up with something .
he suspects i know something . i think he was sort of explaining himself to me , in case i do . we have to go in tonight . i am two hours from a beta version . but i have gotta go home for an hour .
why ? !
she called to apologize . i said i was pulling an all nighter . she said then come home just to say hi . which i always do when we fight , it is suspicious if i do not .
please do not go .
at this point the worst thing i could do is anything out of the ordinary .
tell me you are not calling on your car phone ? !
it is three years old , it
bring it to the other location .
but you said the other
let s try .
what ?
he is been altering the coordinates since we logged on . he is a step ahead . let s jump to .
wait a second . he knows i know .
and your phone messages . you wanna do what you do , it is not a crime .
is that how larry feels ?
uh . not exactly .
hey , we got seed money for the startup ! a million five !
outpost made me sign , . guess we will find out what else we have to talk about . life stuff .
what ? !
jesus , teddy .
i am cool . they did not touch the machine . or my disks . probably did not know what they were . so , you a moonie yet ? milo ?
i met this girl .
what ? come on . is it serious ?
i do not know .
did you tell alice ?
no ! i keep thinking it will go away . but there s this connection . she is been hacking since she was little , she had to move around a lot . plus i see her every day , we are working on the same program . she is beautiful .
a beautiful geek ? i do not wanna sound paranoid , or like a pig , but what are the chances ?
what d you mean ?
i dunno . i guess larry s got me totally suspicious of that place .
what does that mean ?
milo , geeks do not have two girlfriends . most do not have one .
i did not plan this .
oh we are not going to the campus .
his snapples were in alphabetical order .
well , he micro managed the company till it got too big . . . guess he needs to micro manage something .
she is a programmer ?
heavy graphical background , doing design interface for skywire apps . you will be working with her .
i have got a girlfriend , remember ?
right . that is rare around here . you know how nuns re married to jesus ? posties are married to outpost .
. way behind schedule . it is top secret , but everybody knows it is a digital broadcast space . they see the dishes on top , the fiber optics going in .
gary s not into fiber optics . he is betting everything on the satellites .
you wanna survive in the software business , you cover your bets . . . i gotta say , this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested .
can we buy into their ipo ? or is that a justice dept . problem ?
there is no public offering . the guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in san luis obispo . wrote this just to run their web site .
speaking of which . . .
yeah , yeah .
damn . have to go back over there . be so much easier if we could walk in the front door .
you do not look anything like a three year old .
not much . glorified cherry bomb . right by the civil defense sign ? some geek s idea of irony . i been saying we need a camera in this hall .
there s nothing in this hall . someone s pulling your chain , as usual .
unless it is a diversion . milo s in my office . he was tailgating , so i
i could get it out of him .
you are not listening .
where is he ?
we are too late . take a look .
wait a second . i am the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place .
we are all grateful for that . really . go out the way you came in ?
i thought you would quit while you were ahead .
what , and watch all my earnings go . . . down the toilet ?
what do you want , mr . . . cunningham , was it ?
call me ritchie , miss fagina . may i call you alotta . . . please ?
you may .
your boss , number two , i understand that cat s involved in big underground drills .
virtucongs main interest is in cable television , but they do have a subterranean construction division , yes . how did you know ?
i did not , baby , you just told me .
it is for the mining industry , mr . cunningham . we can talk about business later . but first , let me slip into something more comfortable .
behave !
i would rather talk about number two .
do not you like girls , mr . cunningham ? come in , and i will show you everything you need to know .
groovy .
or sometimes not at all .
care for some saki ?
sak i it to me !
mmmm . . . i feel extreme relaxation .
that is very clever . do you know any other poems ?
milk , milk , lemonade . round the corner fudge is made . stick your finger in the hole , and out comes a tootsie roll !
thank you , that is beautiful . to your health .
to my health .
kiss me .
is it about my teeth ?
yes .
damn . what exactly do you do at virtucon ?
i will tell you all in due time , after we make love . but first , tell me another poem .
i think it was wordsworth who penned this little gem press the button , pull the chain , out comes a chocolate choo choo train .
oh , you are very clever . let s make love , you silly , hairy little man .
hey , how are you ?
hungry .
here , have this can of campbell s tomato soup .
if you can become famous , everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame , man .
fifteen minutes of fame ? i am going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that , either .
smashing !
we know all that , exposition .
i just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows that is going on at any given time . we have just received word that dr . evil , the ultimate square , is planning to take over the world .
dr . evil ? i thought i put him in jail for good .
i am afraid not . earlier this week , dr . evil escaped from zedel edel prison in baaden baaden and now he is planning a trap for you tonight at the electric psychedelic pussycat swinger s club in picadilly circus here in swinging london .
good luck , austin .
thank you .
oh , and austin . . .
yes ?
be careful .
thank you . let s go , baby !
you are in the ministry of defense . it is . you have been cryogenically frozen for thirty years .
who are these people ?
the shouting is a temporary side effect of the unfreezing process .
yes , i am having trouble controlling . . . the volume of my voice !
you might also experience a slight fever , dry mouth , and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation . austin , this is commander gilmour , strategic command , and general borschevsky , russian intelligence .
russian intelligence ? are you mad ?
a lot s happened since you were frozen , austin . the cold war s over .
thank god . those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people , hey comrades ?
we won , austin .
groovy . smashing ! good on ya ! nice tie . yea capitalism !
immediately . you will be working with ms . kensington .
you mean mrs . kensington ?
no , austin , mrs . kensington has long since retired . ms . kensington is her daughter .
my god , vanessa s got a smashing body . i bet she shags like a minx . how do i tell them that because of the unfreezing process , i have no inner monologue ? i hope i did not say that out loud just now .
thank you , exposition .
oh , and austin . . .
yes ?
be careful .
thanks .
thank you , exposition .
oh , and austin . . .
yes ?
be careful .
right away , exposition .
where is vanessa , by the way ?
then you will have to go it alone . good luck .
thank you , basil .
oh , and austin . . .
yes ?
let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation .
oh , yes . thank you .
there s one more thing , austin .
yes ?
be careful .
thank you .
austin , vanessa , let me bring you up to speed . dr . evil has high jacked a nuclear warhead from kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one hundred billion dollars . if the world does not pay up in four days , he is threatening to destroy the world .
thank you , exposition . only two things , scare me , and one is nuclear war .
that is the other ?
excuse me ?
that is the other thing you are scared of ?
carnies .
what ?
circus folk . nomads , you know . they smell like cabbage .
indeed . . . if we could get back to the business at hand . it is one thing to have a warhead , it is quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it .
maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle . i have uncovered the details on project vulcan . it is a new subterranean warhead delivery system .
good god , and underground missile . we have long feared such a development .
that is not your mother , that is a man !
damn it , man ! you are talking about my mother !
you must admit , she is rather mannish . no offense , but if that is a woman , it looks like she is been beaten with an ugly stick .
i think if everyone were honest , they would confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag .
i am leaving ! oh , and austin ?
yes , basil ?
be careful .
thanks .
i would say that about sums it up , exposition .
not quite , actually . vanessa , i have something for you .
austin , i have something for you as well .
thanks , basil . maybe the nineties are not so bad after all .
yes basil ?
be careful !
hey , mick !
are you more satisfied now sexually , austin ?
well , you cannot always get what you want .
you cannot always get what you want ! that is a great title for a song ! i am gonna write that , and it will be a big hit .
good on ya , man .
groovy !
well , destructacon , you have quite a head on your shoulders , i dare to coin .
yes , i am programmed to answer any question .
really ? let me ask you this . what is love ?
that does not compute .
why not ? it is a question .
love is . . . love is . . . love is . . .
do not try to suck up to me ! it is a little late for that . i am a freak ! look at it , it is been rendered useless .
oh forget it . as a fellow player on the international stage , mr . powers , i am sure you will enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act .
no , mr . powers , i expect them to die . even after they pay me the money , i am still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma . all right , guard , begin the unnecessarily slow moving dipping mechanism .
well done , mr . powers . we are not so different , you and i . it is true , you are british , and i am belgian . you have a full head of hair , mine is slightly receding . you are thin , i am about forty pounds overweight . ok , we are different , i am not making a very good point . however , is not it ironic , mr . powers , that the very things you stand for swinging , free love , parties , distrust of authority are all now , in the nineties , considered to be . . . evil ? maybe we have more in common than you care to admit .
no , man , what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you , whose bag was money and world domination . we were innocent , man . if we would known the consequences of our sexual liberation , we would have done things differently , but the spirit would have remained the same . it is freedom , man .
your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan i ever dreamed of . face it , freedom failed .
that is why right now is a very groovy time , man . we still have freedom , but we also have responsibility .
really , there s nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster .
not really . kill the little bastard . see what i care .
man , you are one chilly square !
well , as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection , while at the same time experimenting with mind expanding drugs in a consequence free environment , i will be sound as a pound .
my mother s told me all about you .
if it is a lie , goddamn her . it it is the truth , goddamn me . god , i hope that is witty . how is your mum ?
my mother s doing quite well , thank you very much .
listen , mr . powers , i look forward to working with you , but do me a favor and stop calling me baby . you can address me as agent kensington . we have to leave immediately . we have preserved your private jet just as you left it . it is waiting at heathrow airport .
my jumbo jet ? smashing baby .
i went to oxford and excelled in several subjects , but i ended up specializing in foreign languages . i wanted to travel see the world . in my last year i was accepted into the m . o . d . in the cultural studies sector . i thought i was off on an exciting career , but my job was to read everything printed in every country . it is very boring . my whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in farsi . if i do well with this case , i finally get promoted to field operative . . .
that is fascinating , vanessa . listen , why do not we go into the back and shag ?
i beg your pardon ?
i have been frozen for thirty years , man , i want to see if my bits and pieces are still working .
excuse me ?
my wedding tackle .
i am sorry ?
my meat and two veg .
mr . powers , please . i know that you must be a little confused , but we have a very serious situation at hand . i would appreciate it if you would concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest .
have you ever made love to a chigro ?
a chigro ?
you know , a chigro . . . part chinese , part negro . . . chigro .
we do not use the term negro anymore . it is considered offensive .
that is right . you are supposed to say colored now , right ? here s the stewardesses ! bring on the sexy stews !
sure .
do i make you horny ?
what ?
do i make you horny ? randy , you know . to you , am i eros manifest ?
i hope this is part of the unfreezing process .
listen , vanessa , i am a swinger . . . that is what i do , i swing .
i understand that , mr . powers , but let me be perfectly clear with you , perhaps to the point of being insulting . i will never have sex with you , ever . if you were the last man on earth and i was the last woman on earth , and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation , i still would not have sex with you .
yes , we have had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone , an on board computer , and a global geosynchronous positioning device . oh , and finally , this .
no , actually . i do not know how to put this really . well , there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry .
why ? that is wrong with my teeth ?
i am sure .
i think i will give that stew a ding a ling .
here , use mine .
i am going to use a cover name . it is important that it be a generic name so that we do not draw attention to ourselves .
oh , i forgot to tell you , they are prescription x ray glasses . i have very bad astigmatism .
that cat number two has an x ray eyepatch . i get bad vibes from him , man . listen , we should go back to the room , but first i have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog .
do you want to talk to him ?
why ?
we have got a doctor s appointment an evil doctor s appointment .
let me see .
how do you know ?
i never forget a pussy . . . cat .
he is too well protected right now .
we cannot just sit here , austin .
let me tell you a story . there s these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below . the young bull says , hey , why do not we run down the hill and shag us a cow ? , and the wise old bull replies , no , why do not we walk down the hill and shag all the cows ?
i do not get it .
well , you know . . . cows , and shagging .
unfortunately , while you told that stupid story , dr . evil has escaped .
no worries , luv . we will just give basil a tinkle on the telling bone . . .
you are crazy . the camera loves you , vanessa .
i could not have another bite .
sorry . move your hand to the left . there you go . gorgeous .
go ! just go !
i am sorry .
why ?
i am sorry that bug up your ass had to die .
no , this is me in a nutshell .
i am not .
oh , yes you are .
i am not . i am the sensible one . i am always the designated driver .
it is not that i am drunk , i am just beginning to see what my mum was talking about . what was my mother like back in the sixties ? i am dying to know .
she was very groovy . she was so in love with your dad . if there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your mum and treated her as well as you dad did , it was me . but , unfortunately for yours truly , that train has sailed .
look at her hands , baby ! those are carpenter s hands .
of course , luv .
listen , i know i am just being neurotic , but i cannot shake this suspicious feeling about that italian secretary , ms . fagina . i mean , i do not want to sound paranoid , but i have had some bad relationships in the past , and i have some jealousy issues . you went to her penthouse . it makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities , but i cannot help but feel this weird , irrational , unfocused . . . well , jealousy . i am sorry .
do not be sorry . you are right to be suspicious . i shagged her . i shagged her rotten .
i cannot believe you made love to her just like that . did you use protection ?
of course , i had my nine millimeter automatic .
no , did you use a condom ?
only sailors use condoms , man .
not in the nineties .
well they should , filthy beggars , they go from port to port . alotta meant nothing to me .
well , it means something to me . if you want us to have a relationship , you have got to be a one woman man .
it was just a shag , vanessa . you are everything to me .
you just do not get it , do you , austin ? good night . welcome to the nineties , you are going to be very lonely .
thirty years of political and social upheaval . the fall of the berlin wall , a female prime minister of england , the abolishment of apartheid , a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang .
yeah , i cannot believe liberace was gay . women loved him , man . i did not see that one coming .
basil was very concerned to know where you were last night .
out and about , doing odds and sods .
i will tell him . by the way , i have decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional .
do you think she is prettier than i ?
who ?
you know who .
no ! do not lay your hang ups on me , vanessa . you are being very trippy .
i am looking at you , and the whole time i cannot help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie kooch .
do not worry , baby . i picked up a mind control technique during my travels to india . i learned it from my guru , the late guru shastri , a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis . just watch me . watch me , now .
yes , act naturally and we will split this scene the way we came in , vanessa .
not now , austin .
sadly , no . hold on ! i always keep this on me just in case .
no , no , no . we will use the floss to get to the ledge .
smashing idea ! give it to me .
indeed .
that is not the way to get ahead in life .
yes .
it is a shame he was not more headstrong .
shut up .
fair enough .
we have got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag . you go get help . i am gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad doctor .
i am not going anywhere . we are a team .
too right , youth . that is why i need you to lead the troops .
i will hurry back .
listen , vanessa , whatever happens , i just want you to know that i feel bad about shagging that italian girl . i had a sip of sake and all of the sudden , i do not know what happened . the whole time i was shagging her i mean really shagging her , i mean it was crazy , i was like a huge mechanical piston , in and out , in and out !
austin , that is your point ?
anyways , what i am trying to say is that if you want me to be a one woman man , well , that is just groovy , because . . . i love you .
oh , behave !
likewise .
i can explain . they attacked me . gas came out of her . . . well , and then they . . . and i . . .
i believe you , austin . let s go .
hold on a tick , let me put on my togs .
are you crazy ?
do not worry !
i am going it alone this time , vanessa . i have a follow up visit with the evil doctor .
i will secure the perimeter .
lay it on me .
i love you , austin .
that is fab , because i love you , too , vanessa .
kiss me .
behave !
actually , my name s austin powers .
it says here , name danger powers .
danger s my middle name .
ok , austin danger powers one blue crushed velvet suit . one frilly lace cravat . one gold medallion with peace symbol . one pair of italian shoes . one pair of tie dyed socks , purple . one vinyl recording album tom jones , live at las vegas . one swedish made penis enlarger pump .
that is not mine .
one credit card receipt for swedish made penis enlarger pump , signed austin powers .
i am telling you , baby , that is not mine .
one warranty card for swedish made penis enlarger pump , filled out by austin powers .
i do not even know what this is . this sort of thing ai not my bag , baby .
one book swedish made penis enlarger pumps and me this sort of thing is my bag , baby , by austin powers .
sure .
hey , wait a minute
here , have a piece of gum .
hey ! wait a minute , that is my last piece of gum .
no , no , i want you to have it , even if it is my last piece .
i am going to go across the street and get you some sherbert .
where did you learn to shoot ?
is it one of ours ?
no . log com bird twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy , not stealthy , not carbon composite . it does have an odd shape , sir .
what are you saying , son ?
it appears to be in the shape of bob s big boy , sir .
in many ways , bob s big boy never left , sir . he is always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices .
shut up .
should we scramble tachq for an intercept ?
that is its current position ?
that is a direct order . you did not see a thing !
cannot you see i am only half a man ? look at me , i am a freak !
and look what you have done to mr . bigglesworth !
silence !
let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure .
someone help me ! i am still alive , only i am very badly burned .
some of you i know , some of you i am meeting for the first time .
hello up there ! anyone ! can someone call an ambulance ? i am in quite a lot of pain .
you have all been gathered here to form my evil cabinet . excuse me .
right . okay . moving on .
you shot me right in the arm ! why did
yes .
well , after a few years , we got sort of impatient . dr . evil , i want you to meet your son .
my son ?
yes . scott !
ya wohl i mean , yes wohl , herr doctor . i have created the ultimate weapon to defeat austin powers . bring on the fembots !
these are the latest word in android replicant technology . lethal , efficient , brutal . and no man can resist their charms . send in the soldiers !
thank you , herr doctor .
i like to see girls of that caliber . by caliber , i mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character . . . forget it .
dr . evil ?
yes , what is it ? you are interrupting my moment of triumph .
it is about the sharks . since you were frozen , they have been placed on the endangered species list . we tried to get some , but it will take months to clear up the red tape .
right . mr . powers , we are going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads .
well , we experimented with lasers , but you would be surprised at how heavy they are . they actually outweighed the piranha themselves , and the fish , well , they sank to the bottom and died .
i have one simple request sharks with frigging laser beams attached to their heads , and it cannot be done ? remind me again why i pay you people ? what do we have ?
sea bass .
right .
they are mutated sea bass .
really ? are they ill tempered ?
please allow me to demonstrate .
evil , actually , doctor evil .
do not be so hard on yourself . you are here , that is that is important . a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step .
we have heard from scott , now let s hear from you .
the details of my life are quite inconsequential .
that is not true , doctor . please , tell us about your childhood .
hello , scott . i am your father , dr . evil . i have a son ! i have a son ! everyone , i have a son ! someday , scott , this will all be yours .
i have not seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship ? i hate you !
not me .
no . maybe , like , work in a petting zoo or something .
an evil petting zoo ?
you always do that ! anyways , this is really hard , because , you know , my dad is really evil .
well , me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and , like , they do not speak english right , and so my buddy gets into a fight , and he goes hey , quit hassling me cause i do not speak french or whatever , and the other guy goes something in paris talk , and i go um , just back off and he goes get out and i go make me .
fascinating . what are your plans for this evening ?
thought i would stay in . there s a good tittie movie on skinemax .
and that is how you want to live your life , is it ?
yeah . what ?
why are you feeding him ? why do not you just kill him ?
in due time .
but what if he escapes ? why do not you just shoot him ? what are you waiting for ?
i have a better idea . i am going to put him in an easily escapable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death .
why do not you just shoot him now ? here , i will get a gun . we will just shoot him . bang ! dead . done .
one more peep out of you and you are grounded . let s begin .
are not you going to watch them ? they will get away !
no , we will leave them alone and not actually witness them dying , and we will just assume it all went to plan .
i have a gun in my room . give me five seconds , i will come back and blow their brains out .
no , scott . you just do not get it , do you ?
i do not want to .
do not you want to see what daddy does for a living ?
blow me .
what did you say ?
show me .
i had the group liquidated , you little shit . they were insolent .
i hate you ! i hate you ! i wish i was never artificially created in a lab .
scott , do not say that . . .
gentlemen , i have a plan . it is called blackmail . the royal family of britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world . either the royal family pays us an exorbitant amount of money , or we make it look like prince charles , the heir to the throne , has had an affair outside of marriage and , therefore , they would have to divorce .
people have to tell me these things . i have been frozen for thirty years , throw me a bone here . ok , no problem . here s my second plan . back in the sixties i had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a laser . using this laser , we punch a hole in the protective layer around the earth , which we scientists call the ozone layer . slowly but surely , ultraviolet rays would pour in , increasing the risk of skin cancer . that is , unless the world pays us a hefty ransom .
right . oh , hell , let s just do what we always do . let s hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage . gentlemen , it is come to my attention that a breakaway russian republic called kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the united nations in a few days . here s the plan . we get the warhead , and we hold the world ransom . . . . . . for one million dollars !
all right then . . . . . . five million dollars !
oh , really ? one hundred billion dollars . ok , make it happen . anything else ?
great .
how is austin ?
he is asleep .
you did not . . .
oh , god no , i made him sleep on the couch .
why ?
because you managed to resist austin power s charms .
you cannot judge him by modern standards . he is very much a product of his times . in my day he could have any woman he wanted .
what about his teeth ?
you have to understand , in britain in the sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth . it did not matter .
i just do not see it .
just wait . once austin gets you in his charms , it is impossible to get out .
did you ever . . .
of course not . i was married to your father .
did you ever want to ?
austin is very charming , very debonair . he is handsome , witty , has a knowledge of fine wines , sophisticated , a world renowned photographer . women want him , men want to be him . he is a lover of love every bit an international man of mystery .
i know . let me just say this austin was the most loyal and caring friend i ever had .
i am on with a friend ! look , i would better go . i love you .
i love you , vanessa .
well , it is kind of weird .
we do not judge here .
ok . well , i just really met my dad for the first time three days ago . he was partially frozen for thirty years . i never knew him growing up . he comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business .
and how do you feel about that ?
i do not wanna take over the family business .
i do not know . i was thinking , maybe i would be a vet or something , cause i like animals and stuff .
no , he is really evil .
scott .
ok , scott , no one really wants to kill anyone here . they say it , but they do not mean it .
shame . i was recommended . by a friend .
really ?
sir august merryweather ? i was looking for something relaxing . say , a tuscan hillside in june ?
normally , we would be eager to oblige
seriously ?
of course . natural weather delivered to your door on demand . down your phoneline . for limited periods .
you do not say . how real does it feel ?
as real as you wish . hot or cold . humid or dry . anything you like . within reason .
there are limits ?
the technology is brand new . soon it will be more powerful . we anticipate a huge demand . leave us your number . we will be in touch .
no need . i will call again .
. . . bottle . . .
red . . .
. . . head . . .
black . . .
. . . death . . .
love . . .
. . . death . . .
. . . power . . .
. . . preserve . . .
secret . . .
. . . love . . .
hope . . .
. . . love . . .
fear . . .
. . . love . . .
peter . . .
three days .
so i am still . . .
ah , but you have not see the real me . watch closely . . .
you do not get rain like you used to in england . a good shower that is the ticket . stiffens resolve , puckers the spirit , quells the namby pamby in a man .
out in india . so character forming for the british . not the heat . good lord , no . the rain , dash it . a good monsoon . fifteen inches overnight . a whole week of lovely rain . i remember one summer in jaipur . . .
have we met ?
you mean you do not recall ? ?
promised ? who promised ?
there , look !
sir august . . . ? what now ?
mr . john steed , please .
i am afraid that is impossible .
impossible ?
as you see .
then you cannot come in .
i have an appointment .
no women . not in boodles . not since .
really what happened in ?
eh ? in here !
if nature gives a man a collector s mind , it does not matter what he collects . butterflies . old china . penny farthings . a true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass .
we have met . . .
this is not a game .
quite right , but we still make the rules .
rules are made to be broken .
people , too .
then who wins ?
you and i . together . but first you must confront your greatest enemy . who could that be , mrs . peel ? the answer is obvious . . .
hmmm . . .
looks like rain , steed . . .
let me guess father ?
something strange is happening . and whoever knows about it does not want us to find out .
ropes ?
he tried to warn us . . .
directed by laser . bounced by satellite . quite possible .
after the cold war . . .
you need treatment , mrs . peel . you cannot resign .
watch me .
we want to help . . . !
i thought i was a widow . my husband . . . the only man i ever loved . . . is dead . for the rest of my life i have to live with that .
the death of peter peel was a great loss . to us all . . .
to you . . . ?
the institute . . . the funding . . .
a cover . . . for us . i am sorry . . .
quite frankly . . . it could have been you .
to find out who killed my husband .
the doors and walls are monitored , mrs . peel . this is a very secure establishment .
so am i .
next assignment ?
thank you , steed .
thanks , valentine . . .
darling emma yes , we the true genius behind the prospero project . . .
dr . darling , peter . . . all you . . .
an unholy trinity . . .
you killed my husband .
for starters . of course i had to kill the teddy bears , as well . . .
too many cooks
spoil the majority shareholders . in wonderland weather . i planned everything , even the ministry recruiting you . . .
but i found you . all the clues led me here . . .
of course . i planned that , too .
but why ?
you disappoint me , emma . cannot you guess ? for you . it was all for you . . .
our revels now are ended .
oh , no , emma . they have only just begun . . .
i am already married . . .
come , come , you are a widow a most attractive widow . now i think of it , we will need a bridesmaid . here .
valentine , listen to me . . .
right , bridesmaid . now what have i left out ? oh , yes , i know the ring .
ring ?
you are mad .
entirely . on the other hand mad people get things done . let me show you
destruction of their local weather systems . i can zap a thousand chernobyls into the air .
the result would be . . .
chaos . transport paralysis . crop failure . economic disaster . frostbite or sunburn . . . on a massive scale . you have seen a few samples . . .
then that is stopping you ?
one very small thing . a diamond cyclone chip . a thousand times more information on a fraction of the size . if i possess that , my powers would be unlimited . my dear half brother was developing it . but he suspected sabotage . he gave the chip to . . . you , mrs . peel . i want you . but also your ring .
how wagnerian . . . do you mean to say you have waited all these years because you could not create a chip on your own ? that would have amused peter .
speaking of peter , there s more good news you will not even have to change your last name . you will always be mrs . peel .
what are my choices ?
choices ?
i will never marry you .
and you must be steed . please do not get up .
i had a spot of bother at the door .
i should not wonder . not a woman inside boodles since
. why the kippers ?
red herring would have been too obvious , do not you think ?
so what was all this some sort of test ?
congratulations , you have penetrated a bastion of male privilege . i guessed you were not a stickler for tradition , doctor .
whereas you are .
dyed in the wool . but i can admire someone who does not play by the rules .
rules are made to be broken .
not by me . play by the rules , doctor , or the game is nothing .
and just what is the game ?
i say , this is all terribly formal . must i go an calling you dr . peel ?
under the circumstances , you may call me mrs . peel .
much better .
and now that we have settled the matter of honorifics , will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you ?
i did not . mother did .
mother ?
we are not here to talk about the weather , surely .
a kipper . or a red herring ? what were they investigating ?
really ? i fail to see the connection .
i had a feeling you would . touche !
yes indeed . i need protection .
oh , absolutely , but trubshaw s a man worth meeting . no point setting out half shod .
or half cocked .
ahh . perfect fit . the luxury of a hand made shoe . as unique as a face or a fingerprint . or should i say dna ?
thank you , trubshaw . . .
do you really think so ?
not all tradition is bad , mrs . peel . no thank you .
a gentleman has to have a code . this is part of mine . a uniform . think of it as my suit of shining armor .
and i suppose you are the knight .
the most unpredictable piece on the board . and always ready to protect his queen .
that is predictable . when i find a queen in need of protection i will let you know .
as per mother s instructions .
do we always follow mother s instructions ?
for a man in my position
just what is your position , if you do not mind my asking . how did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work ?
they call me in when they have reached a dead end . freelance . like yourself .
i have no choice . why should you risk your life ?
after our fencing match , i was rather hoping you would do the risking . more tea ?
no thanks .
i meant me .
an eccentric recluse ?
june , july . . . august ?
the family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined .
any other vices ?
all of a piece , really . a fanatical weatherman . chairman of brolly . british royal organisation for lasting liquid years . thinks british weather has been tampered with by . . . aliens .
small talk . try the weather .
you should be dead . how do you feel ?
strange .
you were very lucky . four shots to the heart . i found you after i slipped away from sir august . mother brought you here . not me you should thank .
i was not about to .
i mean your man trubshaw . your bullet proof waistcoat . i thought you were just overdressed .
i might say the same .
why should they think that ?
you told them . you said i arrived on a camel , shot you four times . left you for dead .
frankly that is how i remember it .
but that is absurd . i may not be over fond of you , steed , but it is not my style .
perhaps your memory plays tricks , mrs . peel .
that is possible . sir august was convinced he would met me before . but i would never met him . another odd thing . when it rained , he said it was just as someone had promised .
did he say who ?
no . but he must know . incidentally , my double left you with this .
did you say formal ? i must dress .
you mean my other self . . .
either way . . . may i ask why you dress in that fashion ?
i should have thought that was obvious . . . i am in mourning .
how on earth can you tell ?
very good , steed . . .
any ideas ?
well , he was a fellow of the royal zoological society . . .
is that written in his shoe ?
common knowledge , mrs . peel . . .
she had this in her mouth . there , there . . .
thanks . . . i see what you mean about letting me do the risking . . . hello ?
do not bother . here s a bus . . .
is there anything that is not ?
the prospero project was started by my husband . it was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming . in theory , climate engineering is entirely feasible . we thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite . a quick fix . . .
filling in mother nature s blind spots . . . ?
exactly . there would been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea . propane gas mostly . in small quantities it captures chlorine . protects the ozone layer . but it proved impractical . too bulky . . .
but if someone miniaturized the process . . .
that is what we were working on .
sounds as if someone s hijacked your research .
. . . and by you , mrs . peel . . .
then a mad millionaire . head of a secret defense establishment . a group of eccentrics obsessed by weather . . .
. . . and by you , mrs . peel . everything points to you . no sisters ? no undiscovered twin ?
not that i know of . explanation ?
according to dr . darling , you are a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions , suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression , leading to outbursts of anti social and violent behavior . q . e . d .
oh , well . . . just my type , mrs . peel .
have i trespassed on a male prerogative ? we are being followed . i saw him at trubshaw s . . .
barely .
you will let me know if you find that queen who s in need of protection , will not you ?
here s the one that broke the camel s back .
someone did not want us to get to the party .
i expect we will have to gatecrash .
mrs . peel . . . ?
the winslow home for retired lepidoptorists . i am so sorry i struck you , mrs . peel . please forgive me . i thought you were someone else . . .
was i ?
i expect that is for you to know and me to find out . . .
it was peter i saw him . . .
orders .
to kill me ?
nothing personal .
no trouble .
because you always obey orders . . .
always . except . . .
. . . when i do not . it comes down to one thing , mrs . peel . trust .
i could be convinced , if . . . i knew who poisoned me in the maze . that kiss . . .
it was not me you have my word .
keeping a stiff upper lip ?
is that all ?
not for a moment .
you are playing games .
are not we all , mrs . peel ?
i thought you played by the rules .
i thought you did not .
i am playing to win .
winning is not everything .
please do not tell me it is how you play the game .
after you mrs . peel . . .
you do not trust me ?
as far as you trust me .
you lied .
i equivocated . but you are not their big worry at present . it is dr . darling he is disappeared . . .
no idea who . no idea why . . .
teddy bears , cuckoo clocks , toys all childrengs things . . .
. . . or grown ups , who still like to be children .
quite . any childhood friends ? enemies ?
not to speak of . peter and i were both loners . there was nobody .
i am a wanted woman , i know . . .
why s he called invisible ?
you will find out .
i will catch you up . do not worry he is expecting you .
hurry ? what for ? i am just now
you did not tell her ?
have we been invited ?
it is called black leather .
intoxicating . here , have one of these .
limpet bomb . small , very compact . from trubshaw s .
when all this is over , we simply must get you out of that suit .
you first .
shall we ?
snuff . i must insist you try some .
the merry widow ? i might have known . where is the reception ?
have a look at this .
where are you going ?
laying in supplies , mrs . peel weather may get very nasty and i have no umbrella . . .
you need not bother . i cannot drag you further into this . after all , i am still the chief suspect .
no bother . mother and father think i have joined you . i might as well .
but
oh , and by the way , i think it is about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder .
if you would been through what i have , you would not
what kept you ?
the plot . hello , we must be going . . .
. . . in a beautiful pea green boat . . .
a fine night , mrs . peel . . .
still a bit chilly . . .
english weather . you know , after all we have been through , i should say we deserve a long holiday . . .
have you any place in mind ?
as a matter of fact i have . . .
it is the latest thing , mrs . peel .
our little paradise just made for two ?
not quite .
pity your mother came , too . . .
must be . trubshaw s busy . i will send mother . . .
i am no spy where do i fit in ?
you are saying i have no choice .
mobile hq . in a blue funk . cannot take chances . i am looking after things while he is hiding out . . .
it is mother you have to convince . he is very agitated . wait here .
decontamination ?
and you have a new wardrobe . he does want you to look attractive . he tells me you are very beautiful .
i see .
or rather , you do not . learnt the tricks in camouflage . till this accident made a prang of things . how can i help you , mrs . peel ?
peter s brother ? but
half brother to be precise .
i know all this .
do you also know that during your final experiment , your halfbrother in law was under surveillance ?
surveillance ? by whom ?
father . she gave him an all clear after a security test by dr . darling .
who s now vanished .
makes two of us .
are you suggesting that dr . darling and valentine were somehow in this together ? but that is absurd .
getting to what ?
the world council of ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative
i fail to see
well , i cannot possibly go like this .
. . . and now ?
let me guess wonderland weather .
very good , mrs . peel . . .
i shall need a small plane .
you are not venturing alone , surely .
i am going to find out who killed my husband . will you take these documents to steed ?
global warming ?
jungle plants in the arctic ? a lush english village transformed overnight into african scrubland ? blizzards in summer ?
so you say . . .
we want mrs . peel .
dead , i am afraid .
how did you guess ?
you reek of mrs . peel s black leather . . .
it was you who gave valentine peel his security clearance . . . you are the mole who betrayed the ministry .
well , you found me . have a sniff of this , why do not you ? careful , the scent can be overpowering . . .
brenda and i thought we would drop in .
you did not come to talk about the weather , surely .
oh yes i did . i want you to meet somebody . i expect you will like her .
perhaps i would better start calling you doctor again , mrs . peel
she may not know . theory goes she may be very ill .
amnesia ?
possibly . split personality . . .
insane . . . ?
who knows ? if dr . darling is right , you should watch out .
why ?
she may try to kill you .
how come you took so much interest in her , dr . darling ?
anyone particular in mind ?
you .
too late anyway . today s escapade was only for starters . this is no ordinary weather . it is manmade . a kind of weather bomb .
impossible .
no . her husband , she says . alice tried to warn us . a trap . tell mother beware . tell father that is all .
her husband suspected someone very close to the operation . on the day he died , he was setting a test . to prove to himself to us that his wife was beyond suspicion . he had to be certain . he said he was going to give mrs . peel something . . .
guilty until proven innocent ?
mother and father know best .
you are getting yourself into terrible trouble , my son . weather s turning very nasty and so am i .
i am going to follow up on a hunch of my own . if i am right , mrs . peel is innocent and you have a mole .
where ?
in your operation .
i am warning you for the last time , steed whoever s behind all this , looks like mrs . peel , walks like mrs . peel and kills like mrs . peel .
i think so , thank you so much . . .
i feel sure of it .
i am alice . mother said you would be on your way . mrs . peel with you ?
she was . . .
both , actually .
good . glad to see they are together at last . they do not get along . promotion . top job . most unfair . quite a fuss at the ministry .
you do not say . like looking for a needle in a . . .
this way . . .
ask not for whom the telephone rings . . .
no , please ! i beg you . . .
walk over to the window . . .
let it be rain , please let it be
stay by the window . by the window .
valentine peel . i see you have gone back to using your original face .
the last one you will ever see .
perish the thought .
i was at harrow . . .
but did they teach you this ?
you wish .
that is not playing by the rules .
rules are made to be broken .
if you say so .
i do .
did i ? my mistake .
you are , and it is behind you .
come , come . you do not really expect me to fall for
ugh . . .
debbie s marrying rick .

really you went with him for two years .
deb , i want to throw you a shower .
check out the other guy s buns .
bobbie , what are you talking about ?
o neill just tole me . it is sooo great . . . i do not believe it .
he is not gonna be happy . and your parents cannot be too thrilled either .
no . as far as they are concerned the only good rick is a dead rick . but i do not care . . . it is my decision .
they will probably get drunk , and watch dirty movies . but do not worry about the dirty movies .
what do you mean ?
i forgot to tell you . yesterday i found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of o neill s car .
you are kidding .
nah . everything s cool . . . i took care of em .
i feel like i am spying on rick .
right in here . the big show starts in one minute .

thank you , sir .
i know you are as unhappy as i am about debbie s marriage to rick .
yes , sir , i am .
cole , i do not want you to give up on her .
i have tried to change her mind .
it is not her mind you need to change . it is disneyland head in there .
but how can i do that ?
if it were me , i would reason with him first . then , if that failed . . . . . . i would take more persuasive action .
keep me informed .
what ? i am sorry , sir , i cannot hear you .
well , tell the asshole to shut up .
right . hey , shut up . okay , sir .
sorry , i cannot hear you . some pin head s yelling . . . shut up , i am talking here . now look , i want you to go back and i do not care what you do . stop that marriage .
the bachelor party s upstairs . they made me get naked . they hung me from the window so high up it was so scary i fell down . . .
take hold of yourself . what room are they in ?
.
all right , i will go up there and take care of this myself . you look awful , son . go find yourself some clothes .
yes , sir .

no , cole , i . . .
it is all right , i forgive you . i am not the vengeful type . we will forget what happened . why do not we take a trip together ? maybe kill a few lions in kenya over christmas .
cole , listen to me . . . i have got to tell you . . .
you know , when you dumped me for that wimp , i thought , cole , she will be back . god wants the two of you to be together , and sure enough . . .
cole , i am marrying rick .
you are marrying him ? then why are you coming back to me ?
i am not . i just thought i should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else .
cole , i am sorry , i . . .
that is all right , deb . go be happy and smile a lot , deb . do it for me .
i am going now , cole .
i understand , deb . bye . . . be happy .

it is either meatloaf , swiss steak or charred flesh . i will not know till it is finished .
i think your dinner s burning .
want to hear something great ? bobbie and phoebe are throwing me a shower . it is really gonna be fun .
not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me .
you are going to have a bachelor party ?
of course . i am a traditional guy . . . it is a traditional event . well , what do you think ?
it looks awful .
yes , but looks are deceiving . . . not in this case , however .
are you going to have women at your party ?
no , sweetheart , it is a stag party . does stay home .
i am not talking about does . i am talking about hookers .
oh , those . why do you ask ?
because from what i have heard , it is a tradition and you are a traditional guy .
i cannot sleep .
oh . . . i got something for that .
that is the matter ?
i do not know . . . i just feel scared .
about what ?
the wedding , my parents , your family , our friends , my job , the future , our relationship , the caterers , my gown , your tuxedo , our honeymoon , the apartment , my shower , your bachelor party . . .
i think the only think you have left out are our relations with the soviet union . sweetheart , everything s gonna be all right .
before or after i have my nervous breakfown ?
c mere .
good . . .
um . . . that is very relaxing .
now , i want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland .
you better not have too much joy .
would not think of it . because tomorrow . . . we are going to the chapel and we are . . .
gonna get married . . .
cannot i just go with you guys ?
sorry , we got mengs business to do . it is no place for a lady .
did i promise that ? i do not remember that . . .
you are really pissing me off .
your mother s not dead .

anything you say , ma am . have a fun shower . use soap .
i love you .
how wonderful . a seeing eye hooker .
why do not you get undressed .
c mon , i knew it was you .
rick , you are lying !
debbie , i am telling you , i did not do anything , hardly .
the marriage is off . now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life .
i do not want that . i want to be with you .
and i want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment .
i am committed . i love you .
you do not believe me ? okay , fine .
yes . . .
great . now , what do you want to do about it ?
let s get naked .
you are on .
yeah .
this has been quite a night . here s a thought . why do not we go home and give our private parts a workout ?
you are so romantic . . .
ilene , why would i want to do that ? i trust rick .
of course you do . i trusted my ex , mel , too . cousin , i can only talk from experience . what do you think they do at these parties , have tea and play scrabble ?
ilene , rick promised . . .
debbie , do not be naive . men are pigs .
look , you heard what those hookers said . they were supposed to go to a bachelor party .
that does not mean it was rick s party .
debbie , men are pigs if they can have women , we can have men .
look , girls i will stay behind and hold them off . the rest of you break for it !
ilene , are you crazy ?
i know what i am doing . . . go !
great , mom .
you know your father enjoys his company .
ilene , we do not really know that .
quiet , mother .
i hope those guys are all right .
my pleasure , al . . . always happy to help out in a pinch . . . excuse me . i better call my service . . . tell them where i am .

big problem now . soon they go to customers .

maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while .
she hates me . it is over . you will see , as soon as you get married , everything changes . you sure you want to go through with it , man ?
what do you mean , it changes ?
c mon , larry . be good for you .
i just want to be alone .

yeah . i see you are right . c mon , let s party .
i am trying to slash my wrists .
you are trying to kill yourself with an electric razor ?
i could not find any razor blades .
well , this is terrific . now you are gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable . just go out there . forget about everything and laugh it up .
ha , ha , ha .
no , have fun first . then laugh . now , forget about marriage for a while . go party .
it is bullwinkle .
it is really not all your fault . i was talking to mike earlier and he had a lot of problems . personal things , you know . made some bad investments . at least now he is peaceful . . .
this is the park view hotel . i am the hotel manager . are you looking for someone ?
yes , you . we are looking for our room . . . .
what do you know , they moved it . catch you later .
i see what you mean . . . you are a beautiful guy . and you are doing a damn good job .

cannot i just maim it a little ?
rick , i want to cut through the b . s .
i would love that .
good . i think you are an asshole . no , let me correct that , an immature asshole . which is fine , except you are marrying my daughter and i am afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes .
mr . thomerson , i . . .
let me finish . debbie s an adult . she can do what she wants . but if you want your marriage to last , you are going to have to change some things about yourself . if i may make some suggestions . . .
feel free .
first , you are a slob . you have to dress for success . second , your outlook on life . . .
rick !
oh , no !
no sob story is going to change my mind .
of course , sir . that explains it . leather is a very good source of vitamin e .
no . let s at least finish the set .
in a second . . . and you are irresponsible . show some initiative , try to better yourself , stop showing off , actions speak louder than words .
you can tell a man by his friends .
the phone made me do it !
you have been having strange sex . . . !
no , brett , i . . .
it is all right . . . so have i .
klupner . mrs . klupner .
mrs . ?
i am separated .
then there is a god . why do not we take that baby picture .
of course .
she probably had sex scheduled for . o neill , let s pick up the guys for a drink . . . i have major news to announce .
knowing larry , he probably missed the flight .
nothing . . . let s get crazy !
olivier s in that , right ?
then it is on to the real thing .
this is not right .
hey , i am starved . . . let s go get something to eat . we will bring back food for everybody .
i am not really hungry .
c mon . i insist .
my gift to you .
under the table !
the best table in the house .
so long , father .
i do not know . maybe it is because i love debbie or maybe it is hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad . i am not sure .
about what ?
this is your bachelor party . you have not had sex with anyone yet .
get a few drinks into me , we will dance and see what happens .
i got something you cannot resist . i have a friend , tracey . she wants to meet you . she loves to please .
oooooo .
right in there , pal .
if i am not out in a half hour , send for the paramedics .
that is the old rick !
put it to you this way you are gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula , mister .
i am proud of you , lad .
i do not know .
that is this ?
got me .
still drawing a blank .
very .
c mon . get the hookers in a circle . we better put cochise out of business .
take care .
who s your friend ?
and here s mike s partner , in more ways than one . a gal who does not think happiness ends with primates . the very lovely , miss desiree . . .
what can i do ? i am dead . debbie s going to go crazy and end the whole thing .
i will stop him . . . you stall him .
i am saved . let s party !
who ?
debbie .
my debbie ?
that is with her costume ?
you got it .
rick , marriage will be good for you . it is done wonders for me .
true , you are a lot handsomer now . do not you have enough blood already ?
you will not miss a thing about being single . . . the wild parties , the different girls every night , running around like a maniac . . . god , i miss that .
stan , you are depressing me . . . hey , i did not know you were going to fill er up . just take a couple of gallons , okay ?
okay , rick , all finished . i cannot wait for that bachelor party . . . i need the action .
right . give me the will to live . let me go first .
nah , not yet . look , you are my older brother . i need some advice here . that is the deal with marriage ? what can i expect ?
well , the first month it is great . the second month things calm down a little . by the third month you are looking through your old girlfriends phone numbers by the fourth month you are numb by the fifth month , hopefully the football season starts .
thanks , stan , you have been a lot of help .
great . i was wondering , how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing ?
i know , sister , but i have a very good excuse .
there can be no excuse for tardiness .
you are absolutely right . i should never have stopped to save that drowning infant . i am just weak , sister i am so weak .
get going , rick . . . you are late enough as it is .
right . . . think it over .
i do not know .
what ? i thought you told me you had it all figured out .
maybe i did . . . i do not remember .
i would love to get you in an operating room . just once .
yeah . who would have thought they would both be a size regular .
be gentle .
no , we will hit the son of a bitch head on .
it is gonna flash , stevie . we gotta get behind it .
nah , listen to it . it is a pussy . it will just steam on us . it will not flash . go high in the ceiling .
tim , fill out the alarm card . clean the pipe poles , wipe down the ladders and hang some hose .
no . i need a drink .
yeah . . .
kind of an asshole , was not he ?
we are gonna be okay , man . . .
it is not safe , man . do not go splitting us up . not with this one .
what the hell s the matter with you ? you always check the other side . i have not got time for bullshit right now , okay ? we got a job here .
let me take the lead , stephen . . .
goddamn it adcox ! just do your fucking job !
what the fuck were you thinking , huh ? burning people ? you are a fireman .
they were killing firemen , man . when sally showed me what was in swayzak s files . . . they were my friends , i had to do it . i had to do it for the department .
you cannot let him turn you against your friends , man
there s a fire . we have got a job here . let s get on with it .
stevie . . . i . . .
my lt . might have something to say about that .
ah , everybody screws up some , brian . you are working for the toughest lt . on the job . saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building . it is just bad luck you are family .
john , when you are in there . . . in the fire . . . do you ever see . . .
he is alive .
that was an accident ! jesus christ , why did you have to go in there so fucking early ? why did not you listen to me !
just come down , john . just
shut up ! your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you have shit on his department !
you know what swayzak would do to the department if this got out ?
stephen , this is bullshit
what he would do to your dad s department ? you gotta let me finish it
who asked you ?
if you do it like that it will open in the fire . then you will get burned and die .
i want to thank you for coming to my graduation , stephen . it was a great inspiration to me .
so you are going to fight fires now , huh ?
not likely .
well , see you are wrong already . had a talk with chief fitzgerald , and we decided in the interest of brotherly love , that maybe you should not be way over on the other side of town . so starting tomorrow , your assigned to company . my company . one case of scotch , you are getting cheap in your old age , brian . . .
it is coming along . . . want a beer ?
it is old stuff adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway . still good enough though for this tub .
what , you have never seen one before ?
in the field museum once .
it works .
it worked when you were in sixth grade .
millions , stephen and sexual favors .
sheep do not count .
yeah ? what about laura
that was never proved .
i wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment . i mean , is this really gonna have to one of those big brother little brother you broke my gi joe and i am still pissed games ?
what is it with you , man , huh ? how do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up ? that scotch bullshit ? am i really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz ? you were bankrupt , man .
hey ! you do not know me
i know you cold , brian . the scary thing is , you probably could have faked it for awhile . but you see , in this job there s no place to hide . is not like selling log cabins . you have a bad day here someone dies . and that is not fucking good enough . want another beer ?
so that is it ? big bad brother s gonna ride my ass till i cough blood ?
big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie that i do not think is going to make it .
thanks for the speakers .
yeah , you know . you know what it felt like .
i gotta do this , stephen . i gotta know .
i think you are gonna find out , brian . do not be late tomorrow .
i am in heaven , lt .
hook us up to a stand pipe .
c mon , stephen .
you split the team , man . and what was that crap with the standpipe ? you would think you and a hose were never introduced before .
i told you to stay next to me !
i was doing it ! i was up there fucking doing it . you do not know , man , you do not know what i did !
what you did was drop the ball , probie . get that right .
never mind .
brian see ya tonight .
hey .
nah , he is nothing . it is just sometimes . . . sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out , y know ?
c mon , let s crawl home .
this ?
yeah . . . too bright . . .
what , are you kidding ? by myself ?
you got a problem with drilling , probie ?
no , lt . , i do not have a problem with drilling . but let s just have one drill . not one for the company and one for me .
roll the hose .
christ , stephen , let s wait for the hose team . . .
listen to it , brian . . . jump when i say . . . it will not get us .
i waited . . . i would have fucking waited . . .
that is not what it is about , brian . the point is there was a kid in there . and what if there would been two ? i went in because that is what i do . it is my way . it is dad s way . it is not everybody s way .
dad s way ? where did he tell you that ? in a fucking seance ?
you said you wanted to know something , brian . what did you learn today ? what do you say , brian , huh ? time to move on ?
thanks for the insight .
brian , look
just leave me alone , okay ?
had to take on another fire bare handed , huh ? had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie . is that what happened ? is it , stephen ?
i had that fire . he did not listen !
he did not listen ? he was a fucking candidate ! he was your responsibility . he should not have been there in the first place , stephen . you burned him .
fuck you .
just . . . just wanted to say hello . . .
so hello .
you are selling dad s boat ?
yeah , it is just another memory in my life right now . and i got way too many of them . . .
i really should get back . there s . . . there s something i am supposed to do .
yeah ? what have you got to do ? look at you . look at your face . all the things you must be thinking . man , you must really hate my guts . well , you know what ? it is okay .
look , stephen , maybe we can talk about this some other
okay , so you do not like me . you do not like everything i have done . what , because i was not such a genius the way i raised you ? jesus christ , dad was gone , what was i supposed to do ? you tell me , what the fuck was i supposed to do ? !
i tried , y know ? helengs right . i do not have all the answers , but goddamn it , i have got some . look , you are gonna do what you have to , and maybe i should not have gotten in the way . i am your brother , not your father . go on . you gotta go somewhere ? go . . .
saw what ?
when dad died , i saw another fire . . .
everybody did .
i saw it before it got them . i tried to yell , but . . . he asked me to look out for him . and i did not do it . i let him die .
. . . jesus , you been carrying that around for twenty years ? for christ s sake , you were seven years old ! you think he could have heard you in there ?
i hate him so much sometimes , stephen . you do not know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on . . .
maybe i do . . . . what a fucking mess , huh ? people can change brian .
sometimes right when you are looking at them .
i do not know , brian . . . i do not know . . .
what are you doing here ?
i saw adcox s back ! i saw the burn ! i put it there ! jesus christ , stephen , he is been killing people !
i know .
how do you know ?
i knew when you came looking for the chemicals . looking for me .
what were they doing there ?
they were for the fucking boat , brian .
what are we going to do about this ?
i will handle it .
we gotta go to rimgale , stephen .
i am his lt . he is my responsibility . i will handle it . me .
shut up !
you never know till the fire stares you down if you are gonna be
oh shut up , huh ? i think i broke my goddamn arm . . .
i am sorry . . . i am sorry i thought . . . i will not .
jennifer .
you are back .
you look great .
thanks for calling .
uh . . . i have been sorta keeping a low profile . . . the academy . . . i graduated today .
huh .
so . . . i see you are still in the neighborhood .
not quite . just visiting . i live in lincoln park now .
yeah ? what have you been up to ?
i work for city hall .
really ? no kidding .
what , you think i just dried up and blew away when you left ? the world does turn once in awhile brian , even without your permission .
i do not want to be your friend , brian .
when i was twenty .
oooh , very sophisticated . having fun ?
carrying swayzak s notebook ?
let me tell you something . martin swayzak is going to be this towngs next mayor .
yeah . swayzak . humanity s last hope . how can you work for that guy ?
why do you think marty came here tonight ? because he cares about your department . you do not know how hard he works . you do not know about his programs helping west side
all i know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt .
bullshit . marty s plan is only about efficiency . i have got two cousins on the job , you think i would work for him if i did not believe in it ?
yeah , well i like to think i am just a little past hanging out on jp ii watching the irish pick fights and litwalks barf in the planters .
i seem to remember some pretty good nights on jp ii .
c mon jennifer , he is just another north side jag off with a mouth .
brian , do you always have to be so stupid ? think about your future for once .
so now you suddenly care about my future ?
look , i did not mean to take a piece out of you back there , i just thought you would call when you came back . you did not and . . . do not blow it just because of this garbage between us .
hey , sorry if i made you look bad in front of your boss . but i am not gonna be a poster boy for him , i am trying to do something here . there s five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day . tell swayzak to talk to one of them .
. . . okay . i will arrange things with your assignment captain . marty s a good man , brian .
yeah . . .
straightest answer your department s given me all week .
how is it going ?
boss and i are up to about three words an hour .
green committed to a thousand . there s another fund raising party tonight . marty would really like you to come .
i do not know , i am kinda swamped here .
yeah ? well , maybe i can fit it in . . .
hey . . . so are you dating your boss or what ?
if you were not at least the th person to ask me that , i would probably be pissed . boy , you sure know it is a mangs world sometimes . . .
sorry . are you dating anyone ?
you think that is really any of your business ?
well , you did invite me here .
marty did . but i wanted you to come to .
boy , rimgale s as slow as a snail , is not he ?
no , he is more of a dinosaur . guy s not a dummy , though . he is juggling alot of balls on this one .
yeah , but it does not take albert einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not .
jesus , give him a break . there is not enough proof yet to go public . sure , we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch em , and we have maybe figured out why backdrafts , but you cannot rush this stuff . not till it is locked .
but rimgale s probably going to come around to arson .
in a dinosaur kinda way , yeah .
got anything to drink in there ?
oh , there might be something stashed away for emergencies .
homey .
see that trap door up there ? that used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse drawn engines . it was pretty different then . . . but kinda the same , y know ?
do you miss it ? you seem like you do .
when i came back , i knew more than anything else that i wanted to be a fireman .
then why did you quit ?
i wanted to be a good one .
uh huh .
you told swayzak about our arson lead . it is all over the fucking news .
i did not know it was a secret . there are not supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators
bullshit ! you knew what i told you was not ready for the papers
will you please keep your voice down , there s people
you could have scared the son of a bitch off . we may never bust him now . all for a couple s political points .
i was doing my job .
yeah ? and just how much of all this has been doing your job ?
let me ask you something , do you really think marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills ? who the hell are you kidding ? i was there , remember ? i saw you and your brother
leave stephen out of this
oh yeah , he is the real fireman . who are you ? just another probie working for swayzak
i work for the city .
you knew what we were asking you to do . do not suddenly pull out a conscience now . the fit is not right .
hi .
we still talking ? look , i am sorry about the other day
swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered . i want to know why he keeps that hidden .
i do not know anything about it .
you could check . it would be in his files .
do you know what you are asking me to do ?
yes .
y know , four years ago i was working in a bakery . two years ago i was bringing marty coffee and he did not even know my name . i run that office now . marty believed in me and i believe in him . you want me to just throw that away ?
your boss is lying , jennifer .
just take it .
that is a dumb thing to say .
you are right .
i quit two days ago , brian .
what will you do ?
i do not have the slightest idea . . .
i will see ya around , huh ?
it is a small town .
hey , do i know you ?
so you came to me . . . well , this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all . . .
who s doing this ?
your first question should be who is not . it is not a spark , brian . not enough damage . and an insurance pro ? where is the profit margin ?
then who
no no , your turn . tell me a story .
i do not have a story .
sure you do .
what ?
you gotta tell a story too , brian . it is fair . c mon , do not think too hard
i . . . i thought it was great . i loved it . it was nothing to these guys . . . medium deal .
right . light smoke , low roll . couple a civilians hollering medium deal . so young fireman adcox and captain mccaffrey , they head up stairs , get out on the fire escape mccaffrey does the ballsy jump across . . . what were you feeling , brian ? c mon , you promised . be honest . okay . . . guard !
i wanted to be him . right then i wanted to be him more than anything . . .
very good , brian . about your report here . the way to a torch s heart is through his tools . that is how you know him . it is the way he talks to the fire . and to you if you listen .
the outlets .
that is a probie answer . you are smarter than that , brian .
trychticholorate .
good . so our two heroes , adcox and mccaffrey , they go back inside . only there s another fire in there nobody sees . and it took your dad , did not it brian ? did you see him burn ?
after it took your dad . . . the fire . . . did it look at you brian ? did it talk to you ? . . .
not such a far walk after all , is it , brian ?
you walked out on this academy six years ago . one week to graduation . you think we forgot that ? you think i did ?
i want another shot , sir .
look , everybody remembers your old man . being his son , all you had to do was breathe to graduate here . dead hero father rule . but you blew us off . why should i take you back ?
if you remember , sir , my test scores were in the top
i do not give a damn what your test scores were , maybe you could have been a good firemen , but you had your shot .
i need another one , sir .
sorry , but it is out of my hands . try again next year .
no , it is not out of your hands or you would not even have met me . if i push you have to let me back in . dead hero father rule . sir .
even if you graduate this academy , you have still got nine months of probation . that is hard duty , son . if you do not really love this job , it will kill you .
see you monday . sir .
your dennis kid . i work alone .
get used to me , inspector . i am not going anywhere .
then go find a corner . i do not want you in my way .
i think we should get something straight here . i was assigned to this office by the city .
look , i knew your father , he had a helluva reputation on this job . but that do not mean you get any slack . swayzak sends you down here , okay , i gotta eat you , that is the rules and i got nothing to say about that . but swayzak or no , you live with me . step out of line , and i do not care who knows you , i will swing the hammer . you think you are the first ?
pest control .
what are you listening to ?
glass ?
do we have a language barrier here ? glass .
another backdraft .
no it could not .
i just re wrote your contract . c mere . . .
trychtichlorate is a binary structured
go to the bottom . under heat properties .
during heat episodes of kelvin or higher , trych breaks down and dissipates . will consume magnesium .
ever burned magnesium ? it is so hot it takes water molecules and bamm !
trychticholorate . then swayzak can announce seagrave was a murder .
and the putty around the door ?
even if it was used to seal the air off , that does not explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft . a gungs a helluva lot easier
but the right guess on this is arson .
i do not guess .
some people say you do not do much of anything when it comes to this case .
i do not work for them , either .
what ?
i got it after we talked to ronald . torches . want to fry the whole goddamn world . but the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much . the burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls . and he made his burns backdrafts .
but he killed these guys .
but he could have killed everybody there . the firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall . the backdraft blew out the flame . that is it . that is the reason .
what reason ?
why backdrafts . whoever fried seagrave and cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire , but also made sure the fire blew itself out .
that is why the sealant on the doors . . . so what have we got , a torch with a conscience ?
no , we have a stone killer trying to make a point .
are you going public with this ?
no . do that and i guarantee you will scare him off . i do not want him running away .
i am finished with swayzak . i will do whatever you want me to do . i just want to help catch the guy that burned tim . you gotta give me another shot .
fire .
son of a bitch . they knew each other .
and cosgrove . coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate . they were not very high on seagrave , either .
nice bunch of guys .
who all ended up wearing candles for faces . . . swayzak s up to his ass in this somehow . guy can barely hold a drink in his hand , he is so scared .
yeah ? airtight ?
did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report . they did exactly one job swayzak s manpower study . it is not even really a company . no employees , no directors , just a po box .
then who wrote the report ?
it had to be someone who knows numbers . some kind of fancy accountant . but that is the connection ?
how ya feeling ?
yeah .
did i say thanks ?
no .
just wondering .
i hate hospitals . you are so . . . so goddamn useless . . .
i have been lying here hours . . . just thinking . . . we are close . . . we are not looking in the right place , brian . this one knows us and we are not looking in the right place . . .
yeah .
another couple of good men get burned up for their city ? is that how it is going to read ? you are the only one that knows .
like it never happened . . .
hi , helen . man , you look great .
you look like . . . brian .
four months .
four months ?
i know , i know , should a called . i have been really busy . i joined the fire department .
yeah , you would be surprised what three years can do to a kid .
sean , come on out , man . what , you forget your favorite uncle ?
stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident .
stephengs not staying here now , brian . he moved out last april .
you guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile .
and i am a huge fan of what you did to save that woman , brian .
uh , i think there s been a mistake . i did not save that woman .
no need to be modest , brian .
no , you do not understand , i saved a mannequin .
that really was incredibly work you did . you and your brother , fighting fires together , helluva image , is not it ? you must feel lucky to be assigned under his command .
every little boy s fantasy .
brian , let me come to the point . i would like to offer you a job .
i have a job .
this one s still with the fire department . one of our best investigators , don rimgale , is working on a very difficult , visible case right now . we think he could use another pair of hands and you are exactly the kind of guy i want representing us an authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan .
yeah , we got all kinds of traditions like dying young .
not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone , brian . this could be a great opportunity to move . . . beyond a fire engine .
nice boat .
it is not mine . let s get a picture .
yeah . in fact , i just dropped off a letter to the times explaining how yesterday s arson announcement was a fabrication by your office . they loved it . and you know what ? you were right , my family background in firefighting gave it weight .
what the hell are we waiting for ?
engine , right ?
how would you know ? these are supposed to be sealed .
lucky guess . and a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments .
you crooked son of a bitch . why ?
lots of fires . they promote faster there . take a look at the last lt . s list , half the guys on it came from that battalion . gotta think about your future , timmy . s the station .
ah man , if you are gonna bribe your way into a station , why not with me and your brother ?
backdraft .
could you believe that fire ? man ! first day ! there i was , adcox and me , pulling that lady right out of the fire s fucking throat ! i love it here no surround and drown for this company . fighting th ! goddamn stephengs amazing . you see how he took that fire by the balls ? i am gonna be that good some day , you watch .
ah man , is he using that line now on you ? what , you think he made that little gem up ? jesus christ , i used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning .
probationary fireman brian mccaffrey , on his very first fire , showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double check a burning floor alone , emerging victoriously with anna rodriguez , a seamstress for the north shore clothing company . . . mccaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a pulitzer prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father s death . . .
there s no replacement cause of your boss cuts , if that is what you mean . if someone else goes out on an injury we are really screwed .
swayzak s not my boss .
it is in my blood , willy .
did not offer the kinda growth and challenge i need .
uh huh . and pioneer s pride , mobile log cabins . that was in your blood about six months was not it ?
management were pin heads .

you cannot keep being his father . . .
that is wrong ?
i . . . it used to be , when i was a kid , what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs . life and death , right and wrong . when someone called the fire department , we came . . . those guys do not know how much i love them . . . you do not leave people hanging . . . cause that is what it is all about . it is loyalty . it is till death do us part . is not that what you heard ? . . . it is you go , we go . . . cause without that , it is the end of families , it is the end of the fire department . . . and when the fire department stops coming . . . that is the end of the fucking world . . . i am sorry i came , helen , it is just . . . it is just there s nobody i can talk to . . . i miss you .
stephen . . . i . . . can i talk to you a second . . .

here . look i will give you the psyho s number you call him yourself and tell him wnat you want .
sister , we all know what happened to you yesterday morning . i expected that you would want to speak to me about it . but you could have come to my office . your being here , in the confessional , implies that you , sister , have done something wrong . you have not . i assure you . i feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt . if you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of . . . curiosity or even . . . pleasure , you must not
it is funny , you knew . but the first thing i think of is kneading the bread that i help bake for the soup kitchen . maybe that is because my the muscles in my arms still hurt .
i also thought of that bread , father . and of that night six days ago when the mother superior died , and i kept the cool , damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist . father , what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve god ?
i think of running for help , and falling to my knees in prayer .
as i have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning and my sin . you see , father
yes , sister ?
yesterday morning , god gave me but one chance to use something else to serve him . not my arms or my legs , but something i used for the first time , for the last time , and will never use again . my vagina .
you knew them ? who were they , sister ? who are these boys ? what are the names of these good boys you knew ?
how about . . .
b l a k it is .
i am on it .
. . . that simpleton is holding back the race . they got rid of us and keep those two buffoons , mantan and sleep n eat , y knowwhati amsaying ?

please .
if you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours . that is his name again ?
delacroix .
yeah , him .
what makes you think he would write a show about the mau mau s .
c mon , why not ? the monkees had a show . look at all that other junk that is on tv . we got underground cult following .
so are you telling me that you would not even introduce me to delacroix or set up a meeting ? i am talking about me , your only brother , ya own flesh and blood , hook a brother up , youknowwhati amsaying .
that iswhati amsaying . i am not blowing my young career , brother or no brother , for you or anybody else .
there is a name , a term for your kind , the likes of you . back in slavery days , you would be classified as a house nigga .
if you think i am a house nigga then that is your prerogative . you got your ways to affect change , i have mine . and i would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house .
my own sister throwing me out . i hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right . do not bother letting me out .

you might be right .
why are you smiling so ?
naw , not you . it cannot be . that hottie sloan hopkins .
it is that bad , huh ? it is all over my face .
no shame in ya game . she got ya nostrils , ya chnoz is wide open . sloangs what we certified ladies men call low hanging fruit .
certified ladies man , huh ?
she is also moorish .
moorish . ya get a little taste of dat booty , ya wanna get some more .
seconds and thirds , too .
sloan is all wouldat . i try her . i am a tri sexual .
you would try anything . i got first dibs . you get ya own stuff .
naw , just joking . that is you . that is you .
you ai not happy about the green light ?
must be the pressure .
sloan never told us she had friends like you .
in fact , we never knew she had any friends period .
look at my lips .
what are you talking about ?
jim jones , y know . i am not drinking the kool aid .

i am out .

so that is what you been doing ?
damn skippy .
you are in this up till ya neck .
do not shoot me , i am just the piano players .
you can walk away . we both can .
yeah , that is easy for you to do . you never had any talent .
i am so tired of you running that . i always worked hard for you . you think i am a leech , a kling on , i quit .
good morning to you , mr . delapot .
de la croix .
y know what i mean . got a gig yet for manray and i yet ?
you would take no offense if we called you dela for short ?
no offense .
manray needs a job .
how much ?
first things first . i have to know if manray is up for this .
different .
you will both get an advance and you can stay with me .
and this is manray .
we might need some mo money behind this .
that can be done .
my world famous , famous world arroz con pollo will be ready very soon .
hurry up , i wanna watch hbo .
did we get our bill yet ?
yo , check it . this is good and all that but one day soon i want to have much benjamins so i can have a nice crib and pay all my bills . you hear me .
chill , i am the brains behind this outfit .
and i am the feet .
yo , you gotta show some patience . you want me to snap my fingers and presto chango you are an overnight sensation . son , there is no such thing .
i am tired of waiting .
are you crazy ? the joint is crawling with cops now . you wanna go to rikers ? go to the hoosegow ?
we was coming to see you .
if it is not too much trouble could you order us some food ?
we are starving .
dela , i do not know about this .
well do something about it .
eureka ! !
some tap dancing , some singing .
where do i sign ?
trust me . of course i still have to pitch it to my boss , but we will have an answer one way or the other .
dela , i am aboard . as long as i get to hoof and get paid too ! ! !
that is right . money turns the wheel .
to what ?
you are now mantan .
mantan ? i do not even care as long as i am dancing . which reminds me , i need some new kicks .
why ?
you have to start getting into your character .
mantan ! !
how you sound ?
i will not do it anymore .
manray , i am very sorry about ya boy cheeba and sloan . believe me , it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her , just looking out for a brother . i feel you , all this stuff happening at once but you cannot let if affect your work . you gotta be professional .
i am always gonna be that . but i ai not doing no more buck dancing .
no costume . no blackface .
because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country . gary , i have no problem with people disagreeing with the show , it is when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist , that is when i get mad . no one , in any way , shape or form should be censored .
no matter how sexist or racist the material may be ?
yes . and i say yes because who is to judge ? who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not ? who ? who can play god ?
but the line has to be drawn .
do not you people get it ? we are in the st century . slavery was over four hundred years ago . all that stuff people talked in the old days , it is over . folks always crying , white man this , white man that . let s all grow up .
are you trying to excuse our holocaust ?
can i finish ? thank you . i had a great aunt , we called her sister . she went to her grave not believing man had walked on the moon .
i am sorry i am late .
do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone ?
i did not find out about this very important staff meeting until . . .
so are you telling me everyone knew about this get together except you ?
i was not told about this until marie informed me as soon as i got off the elevator .
c . p . time is colored people s time . the stereotypical belief that negroes are always late . that negroes have no sense of time time except when it comes to music or dance .
i understand . but again , in all honesty i was not informed .
forget it . i believe you are my most creative person i have got on staff . you are hip . you know that is happening . i got some corny white boys and girls writing for me .
i would prefer you not use that word in my presence .
nigger . nigger . nigger . nigger .
i do not agree . the negro middle class does exist , and it is rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom .
i am telling you it is not .
. . . to white ? i still feel all of my scripts would make good shows .
i have never been given a fair shot .
you got your head stuck up your ass with your harvard education and your pretentious ways . brother man , i am blacker than you . i am keeping it real and you are fronting , trying to be white .
i am an oreo , a sell out ? because i do not aspire to do homeboys from out of space , secret diary of desmond pfeiffer , a pj s or some as you might put it , some nigger show ? i am a tom ? i am whiter than white and you are blacker than black ? is that what you think ?
that is exactly what i think . i want you to create something that people want to see . let s be honest , the majority of the people in the country are deaf , dumb and blind and i am including million african americans . you know and i know niggers set the trend , set the styles . this is a golden opportunity now . these idiots have to be led to the water .
i am not sure if i can deliver what you want .
you will or you will be back at bet so quick you will never know what hit you . i need a mid season replacement and pronto . it will be on the fast track .
yes ! yes ! yes ! i want a show that will make headlines , that will have millions and millions of households tuned in , glued to their televisions every week . i want advertisers dying to buy on this show . i am gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you .
it is right and tight . good morning , let me introduce you to everybody . you know my assistant , sloan .
i am wid it .
i have done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right . in my previous work it is been all surface , superficial . i have never really dug deep . not anymore . as mark twain fully understood satire is the way . race has always been a hot button in this country s history and it needs to be pushed harder . if we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony . it is about promoting racial healing .
go on . good so far .
i know you are familiar with minstrel shows . they came about at the turn of the th century . it was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface singing , dancing , telling jokes , doing skits . dunwitty , i ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air . carol burnett ? heehaw ?
so let s take this great form , this very american tradition of entertainment into the st century , into the new millennium .
the name of the show ?
it is called mantan the new millennium minstrel show .
i am loving it . you know how i know ? because i am getting a boner , my johnson is hard , no disrespect my sister .
it will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the cns to get this on the air . in fact , i would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque , too controversial .
do not worry about that , that is my department . now who do we cast ? we need a star . can whoopi sing or dance ?
i do not know if whoopi is the way to go .
are these our two stars , sitting here in front of my nose ? which one is mantan again ?
mantan and sleep n eat . two real coons . i know we are way out there but it is satire .
i want you take it there . all the way to the edge and back .
what are there character traits ?
ignorant , dullwitted , lazy , and unlucky .
exactly !
mantan is an uneducated negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire .
and sleep n eat is his comical sidekick ?
yep , you guessed it .
this could be bigger than amos and andy .
let em try . i will kill to make this happen .
so what . we would just give the naacp a donation that would be the end of that . no such thing as bad publicity . so what . earlier you said singing and dancing .
mantan right here is a gifted hoofer . he has educated feet .
who are the other characters ?
do we have characters ? how about honeycutt , snowflake , rastus , nigger , jim , sambo , jungle bunny , and how could we forget aunt jemima .
in the projects . like eddie murphy s the pj s .
ya first bad move . projects been done . that is one of the problems now , everything , movies , tv , are set in the urban jungle , da hood . that is so tired . mantangs millennium minstrel show should be set on a plantation . in alabama .
i do not know about that plantation angle .
what are you talking about ? it is the move . stay wid me now . we are moving fast . what does everybody else think about this ?
we think so .
sleep n eat , what do you do ?
to hire someone solely on their ethnicity , gender or religion is not right . it is un american . i will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job .
i want a hot , young white director . maybe the kid , that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy madonna video .
you are telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot ?
i just want you to meet him . keep an open mind .
besides , what does he know about negroes ?
probably nuthing , but that is why it is such a sexy way to go . sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook , a different unique perspective . a black director , y know what he is gonna do given the subject matter ? with this kid , the possibilities are endless .
what are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky madonna video ?
if spielburg can direct the color purple and amistad , our whiz kid can direct the mantan pilot .
that is exactly my point . has he even directed actors before in anything ?
no ! ! ! just meet the guy . that is all i am asking . look , i will even let you choose your own musical director . you can have that .
derrick coleman , he possessed all the talent in the world , coulda , shoulda , been a great ballplayer but alas d . c . did not want it bad enough . delacroix , do you want it ? bad enough to kill for it ? do you want it that much .
dunwitty , do not leave .
calm down , please .
we just punched it up a bit . made it funnier .
funnier to who and at who s expense ? dunwitty , when negroes start to run amok , the boycotts , when the demostrations commence , i am giving them your home address . let s see how you like it when they picket your lawn in greenwich , connecticut .
i seriously doubt that will ever happen . did not i tell you i know your people better than you do . but if by some miracle you are correct , i am gonna invite them inside my house and we will have a sit down , discuss it like civil human beings .
they did not even view a rough cut , just some scenes we quickly cut together .
this has to be a big mistake .
the big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier . from the gitgo , from jump street .
hold on a sec , i got a call .
hello , mommy , let me get rid of this other call .
i gots to go , it is my moms .
i want to meet her one day , please tell her the great news . i am out like vanilla ice .
i want to speak with you .
go away , unless you got my money .
it is me , peerless .
it is been a long time .
pull up a chair . oh , excuse me , this is my lady dot .
pleased to meet you .
daddy , she is younger than me .
my game is still strong . no viagra for me , do not need no chemicals . just my tonic .
i thought you had promised mommy you stopped .
how did you end up here ?
how did i end up at the third rate chittling circuit greasy hole in the wall in west hell , virginny ? is that what you are asking ya daddy ?
because i had too much pride . too much integrity . i would not lick nobody s butt . some material i refused to do .
daddy , it cannot be just because of that . there had to be other factors .
another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back ?
all i know is what happened to me . all that other mess i just file into the life s too short category .
the same old , same old . trying to get my stuff through .
nuthing i cannot handle .
the truth is never let them seeya sweat . you do that , that is half the battle .
where do you go from here ?
three nights charleston , south carolina .
i did not mean that , in life .
in life ? i ama keep on living , having a good drink , got me a good young woman , make a couple of dollars and make people laugh . have not i always tol you all nigga s are entertainers ? the question is what are you gonna do , peerless ?
baby , you treat me so good . peerless , you are a good son , i love you . you never gave me no trouble .
always keep em laughing .
is that so ?
not that often . he was excited to see you .
so he drank himself into a stuper ?
the drinking is for the pain . it does not kill it , just dulls it .
so that is up with you ?
i was a hostess at this club , your daddy was performing and i had never laughed so hard in my life . he asked me to come with him . i quit my job and we have been together ever since .
your father is proud of you .
he did the best way he knew how , junebug is stubborn just like you .
why did not you tell me about this staff meeting ?
nobody told me anything .
what good are you if you do not tell me stuff like this ?
it was not my fault . if i would have known , i would have known .
manray !
it hit me like a ton of bricks .
how can this be ? you and me at the same time , the exact same thought . it is scary .
the idea was out there in the universe . now what ?
do you know how you will use him ?
not yet , but this thing will never get made .
dunwitty wants a coon show . and that is what i am going to give him , it is going to be so racist , so negative , he will not have the balls to put it on the air . hence i will prove my point .
what point is that ?
the point being that him , the networks do not want black people on television unless they are buffoons .
sounds risky to me .
you getting cold feet ?
i am in till the end .
good . i am going to need your support .
cannot you just quit ? walk away ?
and lose out on my money ? the only way i get paid is if i get fired . and that is what i intend to do .
manray better not be bleeding to death . i need him . after we are done he can do whatever he wants to do , until then , he is ours .
this is cheeba .
i feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer .
my problem is mantan the new millenium minstrel show .
why did you even come up with that shit if you did not want it made ?
it was the principle . dunwitty had to be enlightened . i was making a point . i take pride in my work . plus , i already told you i was not gonna walk away from my money .
fuck da money . why do through all this effort ? why ? are you looking for love from dunwitty ? for respect ? dunwitty and his likes do not give a goddamn about you . so now what are you gonna do ?
that is the chances of mantan being picked up ?
i would not bet against it . my negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place .
like i said , all this for some twisted , distorted sense of principal . dunwitty , he just tolerates your negroidal ass , he does not respect it .
hello .
i have never worked with any of you and you have never worked with me so we will be starting from scratch . i am a fair person , a straight shooter and i do not hold my tongue . everybody up in here should know i had nothing to do with you being hired .
which one is your brother ?
the big one .
i am gonna slit my wrists . cut my throat . for the love of joseph .
break a leg .
let s leave the man in peace so he can get ready .
we both lied to him .
what do you want me to say ?
just do not lie to me .
the pleasure is mine .
c mon . you were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family . you gave your brother a shot . that is all anybody can ask for , an opportunity , a chance , a shot . he got his .
i am sorry , i cannot help it . it is too funny .
everybody shut up .
a small victory is not that small when you have been use to losing .
a gift .
for what ?
no matter what you think , you did come up with something unique . open it .
this is authentic , not a repro , circa turn of the century .
thanks .
i thought it was appropiate .
is that good or bad ?
it is all good . you got a hit show , you are gonna need a bank . plus , i love these old black collectibles .
how so ?
to me , it shows part of our history in this country , a time when we were considered inferior , sub human .
i do not want to hear it .
how long have you and hambone been hanging out ?
you are the one that put us together . we are friends .
that crazy brother of yours does not think so .
he is just playing big brother .
oh , is he ? you getting jiggy with mantan ?
please do not go there .
dunwitty and i feel you have been getting too close to him , getting his mind all messed up .
i cannot lie to him . if he asks me something , i tell him what i think .
do you have to be so damn forthright ?
light ?
that which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light . this bucket of blood .
you can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody . i know where i made my big mistake . i have a general rule , never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you .
that is why it will be so much fun .
the first and only time . a big mistake . i am gonna have to ask you not to see mantan anymore .
work related or otherwise ?
dela , kiss my big black ass .
and that is how you got me in the first place .
i did not think this was in your studies at nyu .
give me the gun .
he , i am mona .
hi , mona .
i perfectly understand where you are coming from . as a minority i can relate to your struggle also . but i think you should give us all a chance . we want this pilot to be successful just as much as you . please do not be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness .
oh , is that what i am doing ?
david , i appreciate your comments . anybody got an ideas ? everybody just talk out loud .
i have always liked the format of rowan and martings laugh in .
pressure ? dela , you do not know what the hell real pressure is . sheeett ! ! ! this is lightstuff . now when you scrambling out on the street in da january winter and the hawk is talking to you with no money and no prospects of money anytime soon , now that there is some pressure .
i did not mean it to sound like that .
now i am privileged ? ! why ? because i did not grow up on food stamps and welfare ? because i did not call home a cardboard box ? no , i never ever went to bed hungry and i am proud of it , too . whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you .
the point i am trying to make is that this is a blessing . it is going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way .
naw . i will take the zero .
you feel good , not nervous ?
i feel fine .
not nervous ? relaxed ?
sloan , will you take your boss out of here so i can get ready .
you sound like the media .
this is nothing . it will blow over by tomorrow .
same thing giuliani said .
tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal . besides , there is no such thing as bad publicity .
hope the same thing does not happen to me . that is some big shoes to fill .
in time .
no .
you getting scared because some people do not like what you are doing ?
yo , dela , they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece .
yeah .
and now is definitely not the time to bitch up .
what you did is dead wrong .
oh , is it ? buddy boy , in this business if people do not produce , they get fired .
sloan is the hardest working person i have ever met .
let me ask you a question , if i may . how do you think she got the job in the first place ? i do not mean to burst your bubble , mantan the marvelous , but sloan is an opportunity .
i do not believe it .
do i have to spell it out for you ? in fact , go ask sloan yourself .
my name is manray , goddamnit .
kook and the gang , it is manray . let s do the taping . you go back to your dressing room , get dressed and blacken up .
it looks delicious .
you hear me talking to you . the only time you come up here when something is wrong .
c mon , mommy , do not start with that i am an ungrateful son stuff .
i said no such thing . all i said is that something must be wrong .
cannot beat it with a hammer . well , since you asked , it looks like i may have a new show , a pilot being shot .
that is wonderful . is not that what you always wanted , a show of your own ?
if at first it is not what you want , just work that much harder , peerless .
mommy , please do not call me that .
son , peerless is your name . now you might be one of these hollywood types , change your name and all that but peerless dothan is on your birth certificate .
i know that is on my birth certificate . you heard from daddy ?
i guess he is still on the road . what kind of show is this ? are they some negroes in it without being buffoons ?
to answer your question , there are a lot of negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons ?
peerless , i did not raise a buffoon . we have enough of those on television already .
please let me know when you hear from daddy , get a number or something .
i will . and good luck with your show . i hope it is a huge success . you have worked very hard . you deserve it .
i will be right over .
he said that ?
yes he did .
where is he ?
he is performing at some place outside of richmond , virginia .
i cannot go all the way down south .
i do not even know why you are still concerned over him . daddy s not with you .
regardless , he still is your father .
it is gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off .
even more reason to see him . he will be overjoyed with your success .
c mon , mommy . daddy has not been impressed with anything i have ever done . from winning my fifth grade spelling bee to the present .
peerless , last time , go see your father .
you going to attack me too . the show is a hit . are not you happy for me ?
of course i am happy for you . you have worked very hard for your success .
yes i have , very hard . has daddy called ?
no .
not at all ?
you know how your daddy is .
if and when he calls , please do not forget to ask him if he is seen mantan .
i will not forget . when are you coming up here to see your mother ?
soon .
i just turned twenty .
helsinki , which is the capital of finland .
finland .
you know , finlandia vodka ? yes ?
yes , i know . jukka , have you ever seen a negro person before ? even had a real conversation with a real negro before ?
that is a negro .
did you just ask me that is a negro ? i am a negro ! ! !
ahhh ! ! ! i never heard of that term before . i thought you were black of african american . no ?
well before there was black or african american , there were negroes . i am a negro .
thank you for correcting my ignorance . i am looking forward to working side by side with you . i feel we make a good team .
my visual style is very erotic , sexy , how do you say hot ?
this is a tv show , not a music video .
then will you teach me what i need to know . maybe we learn from each other , if that is possible , no ?
this is a travesty . a debacle .
thank you very much . i always try my best .
first , i would like to say i love the show . it is very courageous . my parents marched in selma , alabama with dr . king .
the best defense is offense .
we all stick to this , it is smooth sailing .
thank you . and always smile .
this show was created , conceived by you , a non threatening african american male . voila . end of argument . it cannot be racist because you are black .
you have never had any formal training , either ?
not a class , not a thing , just picked stuff up by myself .
i wish i had your natural talent . god only makes that visit once in a while .
you sing and dance ?
a little . i just graduated from nyu film school . cinema studies .
so that is up with you and dela ?
what do you mean ?
are you and him kicking it ? knocking boots . y knowwhati amtalkingbout .
i am sure that was the only thing he was impressed with . you look beautiful like that .
if that was suppose to be a compliment , i thank you .
you are welcome . you should not give up on performing .
why do you say that ? you have never seen me .
i think that would probably make you the happiest . when i am hoofing , i mean really doing my thing , hitting it , nothing compares to that feeling in the world .
i envy you . that is the way i want to feel about my work .
tavis , thank you for having me .
before we begin , i want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview . you could have chosen mike wallace , barbara walters , jane pauley , whatnot but you are here .
i am more comfortable around my people .
let s jump right into it . your show has sparked a world of controversy , provoked a tone of dialogue . how do you see all of this ?
yo , tavis , check it out . this is the two one , the st century and it is all about the money . like my man mase says , it is all about the benjamins .
money makes the world go round . it ai not no joke being poor . i know whati amtalkingabout . y knowwhati amsaying ? i have lived on the street . i have been homeless . i have learned how to play the game , work the game , be in the game .
is it inevitable that the game plays you ?
no if you go with the flow , tavis . that is what a lot of negroes do not understand . protesting is not gonna do a damn thing . if people do not like our satire in our number one hit show then do not watch it . or better yet write your own show . do it better .
do not you feel that is a simplistic retort ?
i do not know what a retort is , but it is simple . mantan the new millennium minstrel show is universal . it is not just for negroes in compton or th in harlem . this is america . our ancestors helped build this country , we got a right , just like everybody else . i am not gonna box myself in . this show makes people think , and they are laughing at the same time .
i admit , that is a very hard thing to do . quickly let s go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors , da bomb . pure pleasure malt liquor . it makes you wanna get ya freak on and timmi hillnigger . authentic git toe gear when you want to be git toed fabulous .
and this is my very best friend mantan .

you slept too near where you got in ?
i slept too near where i fell out .
you expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity .
mantan , it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut ?
hold on , you allegorical hypothesis . do not cross words with me .
ai not jemima on the pancake box ?
dat s yo uncle ben . that reminds me , i have seen a lot of troubles lately .
how be dat ?
i do not know who i am .
well , i will be an alabama porch monkey s uncle .
years ago i married a widow who had a grown up daughter . my daddy visited us often , fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her . thusly he became my son in law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father s wife . soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son , which of course was my father s brother in law and my uncle , for he was the brother of my step mother . my father s wife also became the mother of a son . he was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter . accordingly , my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother s mother .
mantan , dat sho is a whopper .
a song a coming i feel .
well , homeboy , looks like he is at a funeral .
enough .
what do you want to know ?
the good stuff .
i am an asthmatic . been one all my life . cannot go anywhere without an inhaler .
what else ?
are you trying to rap to me ?
sloan , i got it like wouldat .
oh you do , huh ?
just a little something something .
i hope you save a little something something .
gots no intention of ending up broke .
y know , at the beginning of the century , african american had to perform in blackface . you ever heard of bert williams ? he was a great artist .
no , before my time .
you do not read , do you ?
never read a book in my whole life .
maybe you need to start .
maybe i need to do a lot of things .
bert williams and the rest , they had to black up . they had no choice . they were considered ths of a human being . did you know that is written in the constitution of the united states ?
i just do not want you and cheeba to get hurt .
we can look out for ourselves .
for what ? he left . not me .
my people love me .
y know what ?
what ?
you look beautiful like that .
worked my black ass off , first as an intern , then worked my way up to this position .
you leave something out ?
after my internship expired , dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant .
and ?
and what ?
stop playing me sloan .
just ask me what you want to know .
oh , you gonna make me say it .
say what , manray ?
did you ever sleep with dela ?
we did it one time , only once . it had nothing to do with the job , it was stupid . everything i have got i have earned .
aw , c mon .
that is ancient history . that has nothing to do with you and i .
forget about me , are you a puppet for dela ?
do not try to change to the subject .
why do not you answer ?
i know i will not be your puppet .
you can go now .
i wuz leaving anyway , for good .
good morning .
where are you bound for ?
that is none of your business .
is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel ?
not at all , sir . i have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution , and are ready to do it again .
if you are insulted , and not satisfied , remember there s two of us , best .
i am not afraid of highwaymen . my man is armed , and so am i .
you know the use of arms very well , best , and no one can doubt your courage but michael and i will see you home for all that .
ten , sir , and make them short ones , do you hear , captain grogan ?
do not bully , mr . best . here are the pistols . god bless you , my boy and when i count three , fire .
i will tell you what it is , mr . dugan . i have had enough of miss dugan here and your irish ways . i ai not used to em , sir .
well , well ! what is it ? we will make you used to our ways , or adopt english ones .
it is not the english way , for ladies to have two lovers , and , so , mr . dugan , i will thank you to pay me the sum you owe me , and i resign all claims to this young lady . if she has a fancy for school boys , let her take em , sir .
pooh ! pooh ! best , you are joking .
i never was more in earnest .
what is your uncle s name ?
o grady .
oh , yes , of course , ambassador o grady . . .
this may be a very good inn for germany , but it would not pass in old ireland . corbach is only a league off , let us push on for corbach .
do you want to see the loveliest woman in europe ?
the place seems more a farm than an inn yard .
the people are great farmers , as well as inn keepers .
it was my joke . i was tired , and did not care to go farther . there s not prettier woman here than that . if she will not suit your fancy , my friend , then you must wait awhile .
i have acted as i think fit .
sir , i am a british officer .
it is a lie ! you are a deserter ! you are an impostor , sir your lies and folly have confirmed this to me . you pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you do not know . will you join and take the bounty , sir , or will you be given up ?
neither !
how do you do , sir ?
your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us if you succeed , depend on it , your reward will be your discharge from the army , and a bounty of guineas .
what is the service , sir ?
there is lately come to berlin a gentleman in the service of the empress queen , who calls himself the chevalier de belle fast , and wears the red riband and star of the pope s order of the spur . he is made for good society , polished , obliging , a libertine , without prejudices , fond of women , of good food , of high play , prudent and discreet .
only a very little , as soldiers do .
i had thought you more expert . you must find out if the chevalier cheats . he sees the english and austrian envoys continually , and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house . find out what they talk of , for how much each plays , especially if any of them play on parole . if you are able to , read his private letters , though about those which go to the post , you need not trouble yourself we look at them there . but never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes , and by what channel or messenger . he sleeps with the keys of his dispatch box with a string around his neck twenty frederics , if you get an impression of the keys .
i am not sure . the prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money , he would have to fight for it .
not yet , but i believe he intends to .
and his baggage ?
oh ! that will be sent after him . i have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers , you say and at noon , after parade , shall be at the inn . you will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair , and will wait for me at the chevalier s rooms until my arrival . we must force that box . you are a clumsy hound , or you would have got the key long ago .
the man that marries dorothy dugan must first kill me do you mind that ?
faith , i think you are a lad that is likely to keep your word .
and so i am .
and this is the return you make for his kindness ! did not he harbor you in his house when your father died , and has not he given you and your mother , rent free , your fine house of jamesville yonder ?
mark this , come what will of it , i swear i will fight the man who pretends to the hand of dorothy dugan . i will follow him if it is into the church , and meet him there . i will have his blood , or he shall have mine . will you take my message to him , and arrange the meeting ?
well , if it must be , it must . for a young fellow , you are the most bloodthirsty i ever saw . no officer , bearing his majesty s commission , can receive a glass of wine on his nose , without resenting it fight you must , and best is a huge , strong fellow .
he will give the better mark . i am not afraid of him .
in faith , i believe you are not for a lad i never saw more game in my life . give me a kiss , my dear boy . you are after my own soul . as long as jack grogan lives , you shall never want a friend or a second .
the meeting is arranged . captain best is waiting for you now .
my mare is saddled and ready who s the captaings second ?
your cousins go out with him .
it was with this sword that my late father , harry james , god rest his soul , met sir huddelstone fuddelstone , the hampshire baronet , and was fatally run through the neck . he was quite in the wrong , having insulted lady fuddelstone , when in liquor , at the brentford assembly . but , like a gentleman , he scorned to apologize .
and now you risk the same fate . if you are killed , your mother is all alone in the world .
i am harry james son , and will act as becomes my name and quality .
oh , it is with pistols we fight . you are no match for best with the sword .
i will match any man with the sword .
but swords are today impossible captain best is is lame . he knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night , as he was riding home , and can scarce move it now .
not against castle dugan gate , that has been off the hinges these ten years .
it must have been some other gate .
a man of honor dies , but never apologizes . i will see the captain hanged before i apologize .
i had news of you in dublin . faith , you have begun early , like your father s son , but i think you could not do better than as you have done . but why did you not write home to your poor mother ? she has sent half a dozen letters to you in dublin .
i suppose she addressed them to me in my real name , by which i never thought to ask for them at the post office .
we must write to her today , and you can tell her that you are safe and married to brown bess .
is miss dugan well ?
there s only six miss dugans now . . . poor dorothy .
good heavens ! whatever ? has she died of grief ?
she took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband . she is now mrs . john best .
mrs . john best ! was there another mr . john best ? !
no , the very same one , my boy . he recovered from his wound . the ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him . it was only made of tow . do you think the dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a year out of the family ? the plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way , for the cowardly englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you . but hit him you certainly did , roderick , and with a fine thick plugget of tow , and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to . we told your mother the story afterwards , and a pretty scene she made .
the coward !
he has paid off your uncle s mortgage . he gave dorothy a coach and six . that coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle s family . faith , the business was well done . your cousins , michael and harry , never let him out of their sight , though he was for deserting to england , until the marriage was completed , and the happy couple off on their road to dublin . are you in want of cash , my boy ? you may draw upon me , for i got a couple of hundred out of master best for my share and , while they last , you shall never want .
i am only sorry that i was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship s money and pearls .
mr . o higgins , we are in your debt , and rest assured , sir , you have friends in this house whenever you are in dublin . mister o higgins , i wonder if i know your good father ?
which o higgins do you know ? for i have never heard your name mentioned in my family .
oh , i am thinking of the o higgins of redmondstown . general o higgins was a close friend of my wife s dear father , colonel granby somerset .
ah i see . no , i am afraid mine are the o higgins of watertown .
i have heard of them .
sirrah ! sirrah , i am as good a gentleman as any in ireland !
you are an impostor , young man , a schemer , a deceiver !
repeat the words again , and i run you through the body .
tut , tut ! i can play at fencing as well as you , mr . roderick james . ah ! you change color , do you ? your secret is known , is it ? you come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the o higgins of castle o higgins i introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis i take you to my tradesmen , who give you credit . i accept your note for near two hundred pounds , and what do i find ? a fraud .
i deny your grace s accusations , and beg you to say how you have been cheated ?
i do not know .
your grace owes me seventy thousand frederics , which i have honorably won .
chevalier , if you will have your money now , you must fight for it . if you will be patient , maybe i will pay you something another time .
your grace , if i am so tame as to take this , then i must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation .
i have said all there is to be said . i am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish . good night .
i will let down the steps for your honor .
you are going to drive to the frontier .
it is shameful infamous ! i insist upon being put down at the austrian ambassador s house .
i have orders to gag your honor if you cry out , and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not .
ten thousand ? but the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand .
your honor must lower his voice .
all europe shall hear of this !
as you please .
the gentleman has nothing contraband .
yes , sir . here is my letter .
yes , sir .
you come highly recommended by herr seebach .
herr seebach was a very kind employer .
for whom else have you worked ?
no one , sir . before that i served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins .
who else can give me information about you ?
only the agency of servants .
i would give five years of my life to see the old country again , the greenfields , and the river , and the old round tower , and the burying place .
i can play as soldiers do , but have no great skill .
we will practice in the mornings , my boy , and i will put you up to a thing or two worth knowing .
have no fear . it will come out well for me .
i believe they will deport you .
i have faced that problem before .
but , if they send you away , then what is to become of me ?
make your mind easy , you shall not be left behind , i warrant you . do take a last look at your barracks , make your mind easy , say a farewell to your friends in berlin . the dear souls , how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country , and , out of it , you shall go .
but how , sir ?
then ordering fresh horses , the chevalier set off on his journey for that capital . i need not tell you that i was the chevalier .
sir , we have but eighty thousand florins in bank , or two hundred thousand at three months if your highness bags do not contain more than eight thousand , we will meet you .
to risk one s life against such people is an imposition .
i risk nothing , for i am certain to kill him .
certain ?
perfectly certain , because i shall make him tremble .
certainly , monseigneur , does not your excellency consider her worthy of love ?
perfectly so and what is more , i will tell you that i love her , and that i am not of a humor to put up with rivals .
very well ! now that i know it , i will no longer love her .
then you yield to me .
on the instant . everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you .
very well but a man who yields takes to his legs .
that is a trifle strong .
take to your legs , low irish dog .
have you had one ?
never .
but , for a time . . . a passing fancy ?
not even that .
how can i believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you ?
not one .
have you not a man whom you value ?
that man has , perhaps , not yet been born .
what ! you have not met a man worthy of your attention ?
many worthy of attention but valuing is something more . i could value only someone whom i loved .
then you have never loved ? your heart is empty .
your word empty makes me laugh . is it fortunate , or unfortunate ? if it is fortunate , i congratulate myself . if it is unfortunate , i do not care , for i am not aware of it .
it is nonetheless a misfortune , and you will know it when you love .
but if , when i love , i am unhappy , i will know that my empty heart was my good fortune .
that is true , but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love .
it is only too possible . love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult , and it is even more difficult to make it last .
i agree but god put us on earth to take that risk .
a man may need to do that , and find it amusing but a girl is bound by other laws .
i believe you , and i see i must hasten to leave , for otherwise i shall become the unhappiest of men .
how so ?
by loving you , with no hope of possessing you .
it is my only object .
to make me wretched in two weeks .
to love you until death . to subscribe to all your commands .
the amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing , if it is true that you love me .
deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me . if i do not know it , i am innocent .
but you deceive me nonetheless if i believe you , for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer .
with a woman who is completely charming , be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition , and who , regardless of her rank , will show me some kindness , tonight .
then i will respectfully take leave of her .
you will do as you please . it seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other . do you not agree ?
yes but i am afraid of being deceived .
poor man . and , for that reason , you want to begin where people end ?
i ask only a payment on account today after that , you will find me undemanding , obedient and discreet .
always , my dear one , never any further . love is a child to be pacified with trifles . a full diet can only kill it .
i know better than you do . love wants a more substantial fare , and if it is stubbornly withheld , it withers away .
our abstinence makes our love immortal . if i loved you a quarter of an hour ago , now i should love you even more . but i should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires .
let us give each other complete happiness , and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires , they will each time be born anew .
my husband has convinced me of the contrary .
sir william cosgrove is a man who is dying , and yet i envy him more than any man in christendom . he enjoys a privilege of which i am deprived . he may take you in his arms whenever he pleases , and no veil keeps his senses , his eyes , his soul from enjoying your beauty .
o , my dearest love . enough ! i beg you . stop believing in your experience . you have never known love . my very soul is leaving me ! catch it on your lips , and give me yours !
let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that i am happy .
as soon as i saw you loved me , i was pleased , and i gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me , being certain that , for my part , i would never love you . but after our first kiss , i found that i had no power over myself . i did not know that one kiss could matter so much .
we then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that , from time to time , her ladyship cried out oh , my god . is it true i am not dreaming ?
roderick , you know well enough that i have never loved but you ! was i ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy ? ever so angry , but the least offer of good will on your part did not bring me to your side ? did i not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of england upon you ? have i repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it ? no , i loved you too much and too fondly i have always loved you . from the first moment i saw you , i saw your bad qualities , and trembled at your violence but i could not help loving you . i married you , though i knew i was sealing my own fate in doing so , and in spite of reason and duty . what sacrifice do you want from me ? i am ready to make any , so you will but love me , or , if not , that at least , you will gently us me .
old fool !
agreed .
do you see the gate at the end of the field ? the first to touch it will be the winner .
then you must get it .
with pleasure at finding the ribbon .
i had not been in the room five minutes before i was engaged for every single set .
were you obliged to dance five times with captain best , and then stroll out with him into the garden ?
i do not care a fig for captain best he dances prettily to be sure , and is a pleasant rattle of a man . he looks well in his regimentals , too and if he chose to ask me to dance , how could i refuse him ?
but you refused me , dorothy .
oh ! i can dance with you any day , and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner . besides , roderick , captain best s a man , and you are only a boy , and you have not a guinea in the world .
if ever i meet him again , you shall see which is the best man of the two . i will fight him with sword or with pistol , captain as he is .
but captain best is already known as a valiant soldier , and is famous as a man of fashion in london . it is mighty well of you to fight farmers boys , but to fight an englishman is a very different matter .
i would draw my sword , and cut my way through them .
what , with me on the pillion ? would you kill poor me ?
well , then , i will tell you what i would do . i would jump daisy into the river , and swim you both across , where no enemy could follow us .
jump twenty feet ! you would not dare to do any such thing on daisy . there s the captaings horse , black george , i have heard say that captain bes
indeed , miss dorothy , i intend to have his blood as sure as my name s roderick .
as much as possible .
as much as possible ?
yes , for i wish to entertain splendidly .
all the same , you must name an amount .
it is entirely up to you . i want the best .
all right , five hundred guineas .
do you happen to know gustavus adolphus , the thirteenth earl of crabs ?
by name only .
well , sir , this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of his majesty s closet , and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy . i should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the viscounty which you propose to get .
yes !
well , mr . cosgrove , i will answer you point by point . the king is exceedingly averse to make peers , as you know . your claim , as you call them , have been laid before him , and his majesty s gracious reply was , that you were the most impudent man in his dominions , and merited a halter , rather than a coronet . as for withdrawing your support from us , you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please . and , now , as i have a great deal of occupation , perhaps you will do me the favor to retire , or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which i can oblige you .
yes , minister , i am interested in any work in which i can be of service to captain galgenstein .
in so far as i can tell these things no . i believe the chevalier won the money fairly .
hmm mmmm .
the prince left him only that choice .
when is he to go ?
what is to be done ?
oh , i am grateful to you , sir . i am the wife of captain o areilly hastening to join him at dublin . my chair was stopped by a highwayman this great oaf of a servant man fell down on his knees , armed as he was , and though there were thirty people in the next field , working , when the ruffian attacked , not one of them would help but , on the contrary , wished him good luck .
everything my purse , containing upwards of a hundred guineas , my jewels , my snuff boxes , watches . and all because this blundering coward fell to his knees . . .
i am riding to dublin myself , and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you , i shall do my best to protect you from further mishap .
but i should not like to put you to such trouble , mister . . . ?
o higgins . . . mohawk o higgins .
that is very kind of you , mr . o higgins .
you must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in dublin , where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound . i hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house , where captain o areilly will welcome with delight , my gallant young preserver .
mr . newcombe , i have made some difficult loans during the past few years , at very onerous terms , but a year interest seems very stiff indeed .
considering your financial circumstances , mr . cosgrove , it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you . i think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity . but , obviously , if you would reject this offer , i shall keep trying to find a better one .
i am prepared to accept the terms , mr . newcombe .
there are a few other points we should discuss . the loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship s signature , and provided that bracegirdle and chatwick can be assured of her ladyship s freewill in giving her signature .
provided that they can be assured of her ladyship s freewill ? are you serious ?
may i be quite frank with you ?
yes , of course .
mister bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life , and meditated a separation , in which case , she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance , and subject them , at any rate , to a doubtful and expensive litigation . they were quite insistent on this point , and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship s perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital .
i see .
when i asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship s assurances , they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth , in their presence , at their counting house in birchin lane , london . i requested they come here , and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to london , but they declined , saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to castle hackton to negotiate , as they were aware of how other respectable parties , such as messrs . sharp and salomon had been treated here .
now , just have a little patience , my boy . your birthday is not until next week .
but i will have it on my birthday , will not i ?
well , we will just have to wait and see , will not we ?
good night , my little darling .
papa ?
yes ?
one of the boys in the stable told nelly that you have already bought my horse , and that it is at doolangs farm , where mick the groom is breaking it in . is that true , papa ?
what the devil ? what kind of fools do we have here ? pottle , who told the lad this story ?
yes , papa .
is he all right , papa ?
yes , he is fine .
brooksy was better than you , papa , he used not to swear so , and he taught me many good things while you were away .
hang it , mr . roderick james , you have no more manners than a barber , and i think my black footman has been better educated than you but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck , and i like you , sir . because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own .
would you have me spend my life all alone ?
in truth , sir , yes , but , if you must marry , then marry a virtuous drudge .
the milkmaid s daughter ?
well , why not a milkmaid s daughter ? no man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife s sake on the contrary , if he selects the animal properly , he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure , but a comfort in his hours of annoyance . for instance , i have got the gout who tends me ? a hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power . my wife never comes near me . what friend have i ? none in the wide world . men of the world , as you and i are , do not make friends , and we are fools for our pains .
good evening , mr . james , have you done with my lady ?
i beg your pardon ?
come , come , sir . i am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool .
i think , sir william cosgrove , you have had too much drink . your chaplin , mr . hunt , has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter , of which she is a considerable expert .
faith , sir , if i want to learn good principles , it is surely better i should apply for them to your lady , and your chaplin than to you ?
he wants to step into my shoes ! he wants to step into my shoes !
is it not a pleasure , gentlemen , for me , as i am drawing near the goal , to find my home such a happy one my wife so fond of me , that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor ? is not it a comfort to see her like a prudent housewife , getting everything ready for her husband s departure ?
i hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon , knight ?
not so soon , my dear , as you may fancy perhaps . why , man , i have been given over many times these four years , and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation . who knows how long i may keep you waiting .
sir , let those laugh that win .
i am sorry for you mr . james . i am grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting . had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic ? what are the odds , gentlemen , that i do not live to see mr . james hang yet ?
black eyed sczortarska .
dark valdez .
do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight ?
yes . he brought me in his carriage , and he will call for me at midnight .
and he does not care about me ?
he is only curious to know who you are .
if his love were like mine , he would not permit you to come here .
he loves me , as i love you .
will he wish to know the details of this night ?
he will believe that it will please me if he asks about it , and i shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him .
tender hegenheim .
you know that was like a quadruple negative ?
it is ten thirty in the morning .
yeah , if you have slept .
you know the law no liquor before noon . could lose my license .
do not you mean do not need no liquor license not taken away from me ?
yeah , and i could have used the sleep . i am supposed to meet people here tonight , try and get some work going .
who ?
old friend . have not talked to him in . can i use your phone ?
i am i am sorry . . .
i thought i was gonna have an attack . go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou . childs could tell i was not right .
just safety your shit and get behind me , okay ? i will take care of this .
what do we do ?
whoever it is is not shooting at us . . .
fine .
it was the grenade you fucking idiot . look at him !
maybe he will be there . either way , we have to go .
maybe he is dead too . maybe you killed them both , mueller
none of that matters now . we got two dead bodies and a story that explains them . you are either with us , or against us which is it ?
can anybody hear me !
we found him like this
we found him like this ! kendall was with me the whole listen to me !
before or after the explosion ? mueller
i do not know !
hey !
shut up , mueller .
we do not know . west is dead .
what do you mean , alone ?
we found him like this . . .
shut up . west s dead .
we can still come out of this okay . pike got free , he got a gun , he came after us . that is the story .
i asked for a policeman .
you are under military arrest , it is not gonna happen . that is wrong with baseball ?
it is . . . too slow .
well , it is a game of anticipation , that is the beauty .
i just do not like it .
what do you like then ?
c mon , ray , everyone hates the army during basic . i will tell you straight , i hated it here .
you did basic here ?
fifteen years ago under sergeant west . piece of work , that guy . i remember , he used to have these two silver . s with ivory handles and if you were not quick enough , he would knock you on the head with one of them . he still carry those guns ?
they are dead , are not they ?
okay .
i am not telling you what happened .
okay . . . but i would like to know about the other cadets . what they were like nice guys ?
tell me about them .
yeah . and that is all i am saying .
this is one of those interrogation tricks , is not it ? you do not give me a cigarette till i tell you more .
no , actually , i just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some .
that son of a bitch .
that would be my reaction too
he is lying .
well , why did not you say so ? we will just drop all your charges , then
i am serious
did kendall tell you about the px ?
i did not shoot west
yeah , we know , pike did .
you saw west s body .
of course
yeah
they would have killed us both . you want me to write a confession , i will write a confession .
you saved kendall s life
but not pike s .
mr . hardy , i joined the army for college money . i did not ask for any of this i tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed . you say finding those bodies will help me , then go find them . i do not want to die .
you wanna bet ?
oh , you do not ? what else do you have on me ? you have not found any bodies yet , have you ?
we have found all of them .
jesus !
do what ?
hunting we had to hunt him
and the bodies ?
you will not find them . will not find west , either . he is too good .
washout rejects , guys he said were dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead . . .
he is telling the truth up to a point . . .
no , ma am , he just wanted us to quit . making it through was kind of an honor . some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack section eight , command would consider you at the top of the class .
tell us about the other guys , the ones west weeded out .
there were six of us . . .
epilepsy .
yeah . spent half his time in the infirmary . only reason he enlisted was his father . west did not section him till last week .
no , did he tell you about it ? about the business childs ran ?
what business ?
pills , shots , you name it , basic s a lot easier when you do not feel pain
the creek bed
one went off , yeah , but it did not touch him i thought you knew this
mueller was alone in the cabin ?
yeah .
would you have believed me ?
do not know on a map . west told us it was there , we just found it . maybe the hurricane took it away .
cannot do that now , though , can you ?
we can prove that you are not ray dunbar . impersonating a fellow cadet is a court martial in and of itself
did i ever claim i was raymond dunbar ? was i ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record ? no . you assumed who i was , because i was wearing this uniform . do not believe me ?
how do you know that ?
just a guess . maybe they are not where they are supposed to be . maybe somebody moved them . habeas corpus no bodies , no crime , and nunez still plays as self defense . face it detectives . . . you have nothing .
sir , dunbar , sir !
you know how to work a pistol , dunbar ?
sir , yes , sir !
sir , yes , sir !
the rest of you , fallout for physicals !
your weapons , sergeant .
oh , bullshit , he is a fucking convict . you know how much he hated west
i hated west , childs hated west , everyone with a goddamn brain hated west but that does not mean we killed him !
why ?
we were each given three so whoever killed west will be missing one .
west . . . he is dead .
so did we . why did not you come ?
i . . .
west s . any kindling for afire ?
i mean i killed him . is not that what we all wanted ?
wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place . it is getting bad out there where is west ?
we just want to check your pack
why ?
do i ?
yeah . . .
you hated west more than any of us .
maybe , but that do not make me a killer
you are the only one missing a grenade .
which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper . were you watching your pack on the ride in ?
if not you , then who ?
mueller .
oh , come on
we are sweeping our area and suddenly he is gone . couple minutes later , phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away
that is exactly what he says about you .
who you gonna trust , ray ? him or your friend ?
enough to go to prison ? childs px scam , mueller was in on it
bullshit .
look in my pack .
why ?
just look . little pocket .
you are lying
pull up my sleeve . right arm .
becoming a morphine addict during basic ai not exactly something you want to broadcast . only mueller and childs know .
you saw west , right ? how was he killed ?
full clip to the body
from up close or far away ?
his chest was hamburger
that is close range . you go full auto on a guy from close range , you are gonna be swimming in blood . look at my uniform . nothing .
they ?
mueller and childs . one of them must have taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper . . .
what do not you know ?
this is a lot of information to be getting . . . i have to think
no . . . no , we can just wait till we get back and then tell the m . p . s
we wait and i am a dead man . i got a black face , a criminal record , and over a hundred other cadets who will testify how much i hated west my court martial will take six minutes . it is either me or them , ray , and you gotta decide right now .
put it down !
coast guard , special detective detail . we feel this incident may have put the beaches of florida at risk .
levi , you got about four hours before armed men show up here , put you on a plane to washington , and lock you in a very small dark room . i suggest you talk to us .
but not the only victim , right ?
my , my , my , how did things turn so hostile so quickly ? if i did not know better , i would say you two were out to get me .
senator daddy must be thrilled .
he is not , shall we say , wild about the idea . he has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities , and i have done my best to oblige him . however , in the last four weeks , i began a relationship with another cadet . what do you think of that ?
i think you just blew do not ask , do not tell out of the fucking water .
the sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled . my father interceded , so instead , west sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that i was gay .
you said you wanted to know what happened i am telling you the truth .
what happened to degrees ?
i did not kill him
then who did ?
but you did not .
no . poetic justice , though .
right in front of us . mueller went after him but we held him back .
i honestly do not know . maybe to have someone to cover for him . and i wish i could , but there s no doubt in my mind he killed those men .
mr . hardy ?
stop .
how many murders did you cover up ? one ? five ? maybe an even ten .
can i go to jail for punching a guy who s been shot ?
my heart weeps .
there s that word again . as i told you , i was not in the room when everyone started shooting .
so i should stay silent about his misdeeds ? the guns went off , i ran in , childs shot me , pike and mueller were dead , and dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun
dunbar was running out the door ? ohhhhhh . . . see that is where i was confused , because i thought you said nunez was running out the door .
no . i said dunbar .
huh . you know , i really thought you said nunez . i thought you said dunbar was gone , my fault , i gotta check the tape on that . oh , yeah we taped the last interview . this one too . cause it would be a real break for us to catch you in a lie .
well ?
sorry to disappoint . i am on painkillers for the injury they cloud the mind . you are right , it was nunez . any more questions ?
then we will leave it up to the courts his word against mine . what does his father do again ? steelworker ? does not matter , i am sure justice will be served . in any case , my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions , these accusations on his son . he is quite protective .
i was just thinking of that is going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you .
i did not do anything
because of what i saw . who really killed west .
because i was standing next to him .
i did not
but you cannot prove it ! you cannot prove anything until we find the bodies !
i do not know
where are they !
maybe
maybe what
maybe he . . .
been better . i read about that is been happening with you . . . i should have called
what kind of trouble are you in ?
would i have called you if it was not ? if there was any other way
tell me what i can do .
and here you are going out of house . how is that make you feel , jules ?
it is not west , is it ? tell me it is not west .
well , he is a good soldier .
and the problem is you only got three .
no , the problem is one s dead , one s got a bullet in his arm , and one will not talk . the one who will not talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick up .
i am assuming that is what made him the dead one ?
cadet roberto r . nunez . killed right in front of me .
the guy in interrogation said he would only talk to a cop .
and i am the closest thing to it , right ?
i am not gonna let that happen .
he can wait . kendall s out of surgery .
who killed pike ?
someone must have got a shot off . he was not exactly a moving target .
there was a hurricane , bill , the wind probably moved it .
habeas corpus you have to have a body to have a crime .
okay , then let s widen the search to include the endzone in giants stadium and the trunk of my car
without the body we have no physical proof . we need a confession .
from dunbar ? i hate to break this to you , but i do not think he is gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty .
nevertheless
nevertheless what ? kendall will testify and that will be enough .
not for me .
jag gets here in three hours . try for the confession .
home , i am done .
what about the confession ?
what the hell are you talking about
i am talking about west ! we had him , bill , we were there . you are the fucking base commander , you knew what he did to cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has
was dead right . you think dunbar s on the level ?
yeah .
does osborne agree ?
that is horseshit and you know it .
maybe . but it is my fault and i will carry it .
i would not know where to start . i guess it was about one man framing another . he thought if the other guy got blamed , people would over look his own wrong doings .
the senator . . .
do not be . i am not cut out to deal with the west s of the world .
you are a good soldier , bill .
i thought you said that was not a compliment .
what are you talking about ?
if you let him testify then it would have all come out . west was supposed to take care of it out there , shut nunez up and then disappear . but it got messy and people got killed . so you called your old pal tom hardy , figuring if worse came to worse , he would cover for you .
you are drunk
i am not going to cover for you , bill . not for this .
or what ? you have gone round the bend
west had a partner . someone who knew how to get things done .
that is preposterous
toxicology report came back . kendall s attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine , maybe you have heard of it . it is for asthmatics . if an epileptic takes enough , it kills them . i checked with the nurses at the hospital you are the only other person who visited kendall .
i wanted to see if he was okay
you poisoned him , bill . you heard our interrogation , you knew he was ready to crack , so you killed him , just like pike .
i am not even going to dignify that
no ! you will stand there and you will listen ! what happened to you , bill ? you were the one who joined up to do good in the world . you were the one who believed in it
you want to get into a finger pointing contest about character ? the army kicked you out for drugs , the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster , and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct ? there s only one criminal standing in this room and it is you .
not for long .
you are crazy
you cannot duck this , bill . i may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but i will not let this happen .
for the last time , i have no idea what you are talking about
get your hands away from the desk !
fantastic . you want to tell me that is going on ?
you knew sergeant west ?
he was our drill here . mangs older than sand .
sergeant west s served for twenty three years . he is the public face of the modern army .
and you notice i am not in the army anymore .
you and the colonel go back .
he got me through basic and a lot of other stuff . i owe him .
you are the tom hardy i have been reading about in the papers , right ? new orleans pd fired you for taking bribes from guissepe torres .
it was for suspicion of bribery , it is really all in the wording
wording and your friendship with the colonel aside , i am not comfortable having you involved in this .
subtlety really is not one of you finer points , is it , osborne ?
hurricane knocked out our mainframe , so all we have are their dogtags . cadets raymond dunbar and levi kendall
levi ? who names their kid levi
senator jonathan kendall , of ohio .
christ . . . remind me to thank bill for mentioning that on the phone
kendall junior is still in surgery , so he will not be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour the cadet we are talking to first is dunbar .
he is in interrogation ?
yes .
move him .
why ?
because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms , which does not exactly put people at ease . is he cute ?
excuse me ?
is dunbar cute ?
that is the most unprofessional
is he handsome , self assured , carry himself well , does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor , does he have good bones , suggesting good breeding , does he slouch or sit up straight these are important questions , as they reveal a great deal about this mangs character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute ?
good cop bad cop ?
something like that .
ten bucks says i have him talking in under three minutes .
see , ray , this is what we call good cop , bad cop . she shouts , i stand up for you , you are grateful , a bond of trust is established .
i believe somebody owes me ten dollars
you made me look like an idiot
oh , i am sorry , i did not know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good everyone knows good cop , bad cop by admitting it i appeared trustworthy .
you are right . we should sit in silence .
we are in the middle of a murder case
best time for banal chit chat .
microrecorder for kendall did not have time to wire his room . now tell me why you joined the army or i will jab this pen through your neck .
you had a mobile of bayonets above your crib .
something like that . you ?
i lost a bet .
yeah . that is just the story i tell the girls to get them into bed . truth is . . . i do not know . the whole honor and duty thing . make a difference in the world , crap like that . did not really work out .
the very same .
you do understand that there s absolutely no way i could ever be attracted to you , right ?
i plan to grow on you .
you are off to a late start .
so noted .
imagine what it must have been like for them out there . what do you think of dunbar ?
he is telling the truth , up to a point .
what point ?
being back here . gives me the willies .
not the happiest of memories ?
got it .
have no fear , osborne , we have not yet begun to fight .
i lied . wait for it . . .
i do not think that has anything to do with
that means under a year . let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me murder is basic . there are no conspiracies , no grand mysteries , and no evil puppet masters behind it all , pulling the strings murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people it does not always make sense but it is always neat . dunbar s our guy .
everyone s capable of murder , osborne .
well , i am sure if he would known this was all going to happen he would have tried harder to witness it for you
i do not know .
you knew what he was capable of and you just stood by . it was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass , and you know what ? he deserved it . there s your confession .
watch me .
you said you owed styles and now you are gonna turn your back on him ?
you did more than try . you cracked dunbar in less than three minutes , as an investigator you are phenomenal
phenomenal at taking bribes , right ?
oh , spare me the reverse psychology bullshit ! this is not my great second chance , osborne . everyone thinks i am a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that . nobody will ever know what happens here
but you will .
because it is my job . because people are dead . because of the whole honor and duty thing , make a difference in the world , crap like that . we can do this , hardy .
what ?
dunbar . . . he said he did not shoot west . west was not shot , kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and dunbar never saw the body .
what happened next ?
and they are smart about it . they know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated , you need a fall guy and for that to work , you have to have a witness .
dunbar .
exactly , someone who s not involved , who s word cannot be questioned . you only let them see what you want them to see , you make them believe , so when the time comes , they have totally bought into your version of events .
they believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent .
and if they are asked , that is what they will tell the , world .
so it is a good plan but it goes wrong mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy , which means they have to bring dunbar and kendall into the cover story
kendall maybe would have agreed , but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin
buttfucks the cabin ?
and all hell breaks loose . a lot of good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz , bang , zoom , happy ending .
so why , after dunbar drags kendall out from under a house , does the senator s son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber ?
that bugs you too ?
little bit .
let s go talk to bill . . .
they got their stories straight .
what ?
what kendall said the type of guys you do not feel comfortable going to sleep around . that is what dunbar said about childs to the letter .
are you sure ?
positive . hardy , they planned this .
good idea .
see , i just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls then i call every newspaper in the country with the story about how senator kendall s gay son went nuts on a training mission
you could not have known
yeah , i could have . should have .
you wanted to get the truth .
no , i did not . i wanted to humiliate him . for what he did to dunbar . for fucking over the little guy .
you mean the falsely accused ?
yeah .
so did i .
now i go home , get drunk , and try and forget this ever happened .
think it will work ?
nah .
it dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority . . . and all i did here was follow orders . it did not add up . plus , i got kicked out .
for what ?
that is gonna stay my secret .
maybe . . . maybe we were nowhere near . sometimes mysteries stay mysteries . i have not by any chance grown on you , have i ?
no .
good , just making sure .
get in .
right back where we started .
is not this how your story goes ?
hardy , for chrissakes
where is west s body ?
no death certificates . no crime .
seven .
seven guys . what was it you said ? you were just starting to believe i was not the guy people said .
this is the perfect time . you know what makes a good detective ? the number of confessions they get . you are a good detective , osborne . so now you get mine .
what if i do not want it ?
tough .
there are degrees of truth , officer . always degrees .
you are a good man , hardy .
really .
far as i am concerned , whatever you did in the past can stay in the past .
nobody saw . but i do not think so .
yeah . i can wait till you are off the base and do it myself .
leaving without saying goodbye . what are you gonna do ?
go home , get drunk , and try and forget this ever happened .
think it will work ?
nah .
want company ?
i should probably write that down .
yeah .
in case you need me to testify about the shooting . they will clear you .
yeah . but he was a lot of other things , too . thanks .
what are you talking about ?
a gay senator s son who let his sarge get fragged on a training exercise ? the press will crucify you and your father . his career will be over and it will be your fault . but we do this different and you come out a hero .
mueller . he is as bad as west and we both know it . now i cannot do it , cause i am tied up , but we get the others to go along
i do not think i want to hear this
someone else can do the deed , it does not have to be you . maybe nunez too , he is got a tendency to follow mueller , but the rest of us can come out ahead the guys who took out their sergeant s killers ! we will move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged west , all we gotta do is tell the story right .
although that will not matter much when coupled with the murder charge
the faggot speaks .
you ever been in a hurricane , mueller ?
you ever been in a hurricane , mueller ?
oh , yeah , excuse me , sergeant , sir , we do not feel like going out we do not want to get rained on . he will kick our asses from here to cleveland .
poor fucker my ass . . .
you better watch it , faggot , i am not sure you and childs did not do him
yeah and he does not know when
i remember now , it was before the explosion
oh , you remember now
i am about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly
so you took off your shirt ?
to start a fire , goddammit ! what about him , huh ? maybe he offed the sarge and changed shirts , brought an extra one in his pack . y ever think of that ? go ahead , cut him loose ! first chance he gets , he will waste the rest of us , that is how they work
what , the truth ? please . there are degrees of truth , officer , always degrees . things are not what they seem .
he wanted more than that .
you are gonna die tonight , faggot . clear as day .
no one else heard it ?
he whispered it in my ear .
because he would shot mueller .
but you did not see it , right ?
like i said , i was in the kitchen . when i came out , mueller and pike were dead , nunez and childs were hit and dunbar was gone .
we have been making progress , i see .
fifty minutes .
not much time to solve the crime . tell me , detective , how did it feel taking blood money from guissepe torres ? did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it ?
no , but it got you interested , did not it ? got you to dig . inspired ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they did not belong .
then he is mistaken . you know , i really do not think my father would approve of this line of questioning
you cannot threaten me
what ?
it will and you know why ? because you are not a person anymore , you are a cadet in the united states army you have no identity , no miranda warning , and no rights . so i am gonna throw you to the wolves , and unlike you , i am gonna get away with it , because you are pissing me off !
wait
what .
wrong answer
we did get our stories straight , but not because we killed anyone . it was because i threatened him .
childs .
i scared dunbar into silence . he is been trying to cover for me the whole time . we got here , you came to see me . . . i did not know if i could trust him with that kind of secret
so you framed him . the same way childs was going to frame pike .
he came after us . and i told dunbar he had to kill him . . .
toughens us up , pike . you do not like it , quit .
what the fuck happened to you ? one minute you are next to me and the next you are gone and the sky lights up like fucking christmas
blame the nigger , then , huh ? someone turns up dead , you just look for the darkest face in the crowd
what the fuck are you doing ?
shut the fuck up . he was gonna cut him loose .
where is your shirt , mueller ?
i used it to start the fire
still got mine on , not a speck of blood on it . not a bad trick for a murderer you said you burned yours ?
we are not going anywhere .
the fuck are you talking about
you are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard
bullshit
until we return to base , and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in sergeant west s body
shut up !
failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself
yeah .
terrible tragedy . one of those section eight boys worked in here . pike . heard he got out okay .
no , no that was cadet dunbar
you mean ray dunbar ? well , that ai not right .
ma am , ray dunbar s black .
he asked to see a policeman , we are getting him a policeman .
but this guy you called , he is not even army
he is former army and the best i have ever seen in a room . besides , he knows the territory , we did basic together here . you have had three hours with dunbar and have not gotten a peep , we need to take a different tack .
he is not army , it is not official
then it is unofficial .
i called the jag corps , the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to d . c . on a transport leaving here at
no
it is too neat .
he tried to burn dunbar to us . you do not do that if you are not involved .
we know .
i am giving you a chance to walk away .
gets on his plane in ten minutes , which means you two are done . you will understand if i do not walk you out .
the army kicked you out for drugs . . .
sir , yes , sir !
those who i deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit , and those who refuse to quit i will kill . you ever hear of a training accident give me a sir , yes , sir !
sir , yes , sir !
in my time i have killed sixteen men for the good of my country , sixteen men whose entrance into this army i could not condone , as it would weaken the fabric of this nationgs defense ! this base suffers an average of three training accidents a year , unfortunate incidents that i will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me , understand give me a sir , yes , sir !
sir , yes , sir !
so forget what you have seen on sixty fucking minutes about the kinder , gentler military you will either succeed , quit , or die by my hand !
sir , yes , sir !
lz is two clicks north of a cabin , you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find ! each area has twenty targets , first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins ! teams are as follows dunbar and nunez , pike and mueller , kendall and childs !
it was on that night karl met his destiny . and i met mine . almost .
that is great .
i just saw the woman i am going to marry , i know it . but then i lost her .
tough break . most men have to get married before they lose their wives .
i am going to spend the rest of my life looking for her . that or die alone .
jesus , kid . let me guess . real pretty , blonde hair , blue hat ?
yes !
i know her uncle . friends of the family .
who is she ? where does she live ?
kid . do not waste your time . she is out of your league .
sure i do . you were hot shit back in hickville , but here in the real world , you got squat . you do not have a plan . you do not have a job . you do not have anything but the clothes on your back .
i have got a whole backpack full of clothes !
kid , you were a big fish in a small pond . this here is the ocean , and you are drowning . take my advice and go back to puddleville . you will be happy there .
sorry , kid . i do not do charity .
i will work night and day , and you will not have to pay me . you just have to tell me who she is .
a few rabbits , but i think one of them was already dead .
that would explain the indigestion .
there s only one i want .
thank you .
good luck , kid .
edward bloom .
yes .
oh . here ! right here . edward bloom . we were not expecting you yet .
not yet .
the town of spectre . best kept secret in alabama . says here you are from ashton , right ? last person we had from ashton was norther winslow .
the poet ? what ever happened to him ?
he is still here . let me buy you a drink . i will tell you all about it . hell , i will have him tell you .
no . i have gotta meet somebody . i am already running late .
it truly is .
why ?
this town is everything a man could ask for . and if i were to end up here , i would consider myself lucky . but the fact is , i am not ready to end up anywhere .
no one s ever left .
i do not expect to .
i will go in right now and get that eye .
then do it .
fine , i will .
fine , you do it .
fine , i am doing it .
i brought it .
let s see it .
don .
what the hell are you doing ? this is my girl . mine !
i did not know she belonged to anybody .
dr . bennett . it is good to see you . my wife , josephine .
a pleasure .
absolutely . be good for you to talk to him .
my father and i have an advantage . we never talk .
thirty years . maybe more .
how would you describe him ?
five eleven . one eighty . regulated hypertension . how would his son describe him ?
a thousand times . he caught an uncatchable fish .
not that one . the real story . did he ever tell you that ?
no .
your mother came in about three in the afternoon . her neighbor drove her , on account of your father was on business in wichita . you were born a week early , but there were no complications . it was a perfect delivery . now , your father was sorry to miss it , but it was not the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then , so i cannot see as it would have been much different had he been there . and that is the real story of how you were born .
what did she look like ?
well , she . . . uh . . .
was she nekkid ?
it is not a woman , it is a fish . no one ever catches her .
eighteen .
i am eight . that means when i am eighteen , you will be . and when i am , you will only be .
you are pretty good at arithmetic .
and when i am , you will be . and that is not much difference at all .
i suspect it will hurt a lot .
i promise . someday . when i am really supposed to .
how did you know ?
apparently i have overlooked this one piece of it , and i would like to remedy that . you see , in order for the town to be preserved , the trust must own it in its entirety .
so i have heard .
i will offer you more than it is worth . and you know you will not have to move . nothing will change except the name on the deed , you have my word .
then i do not think so mr . bloom . if nothing is going to change , i would just as soon it not change in the way it has not been changing all this time .
it is not like you are going to lose anything . you can ask anyone in town . i have been nothing if not generous . i want the best for everyone .
i am not convinced you should be happy .
i am sorry . have i offended you ?
i was . he was . turns out that was a big difference .
i see . i thank you for your time .
i can get it . i can just . . .
please . go . just go .
i will . . .
go .
i know .
and from the moment i saw her until the moment i die , she is the only one .
lucky girl .
i am sorry , jenny . i am .
you are lucky to get four words out of them in english . but if you were to walk through the jungle , you would hear them speaking the most elaborate french . those parrots talk about everything politics , movies , fashion everything but religion .
i was dreaming .
what were you dreaming about ?
that is terrible .
terrible for her , but think about me , young boy with that kind of power . was not three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said , your grampa is going to die . well , i ran right back to my parents . my father said , no , gramps is fine , but i could see there was trepidation . and true enough , that next morning my grampa was dead .
no , i understand .
he was slipping her a little extra cream .
stop .
they were squeezing the cheese . clanking the bottles . licking the popsicle .
can i take your picture ?
you do not need a picture . just look up handsome in the dictionary .
please ?
i never knew .
will never told you that ? probably just as well . he would have told it all wrong anyway . all the facts and none of the flavor .
oh , so this is a tall tale ?
well , it is not a short one .
well , we were all set to , but there was a complication .
truth is , i have been thirsty my whole life . never really known why .
you were talking about your wedding .
i did not forget . i was just working on a tangent . see , most men , they will tell a story straight through , and it will not be complicated , but it will not be interesting either .
i like your stories .
and i like you .
really ?
would not lie to you . and they have got all you can eat buffets . you can eat a lot , cannot you ?
i can .
so why are you wasting your time in a small town ? you are a big man . you should be in the big city .
that is your name , giant ?
karl .
mine s edward . and truthfully , i do want you to leave , karl . but i want to leave with you . you think this town is too small for you , well , it is too small for a man of my ambition . i cannot see staying here a day longer .
you do not like it ?
i love every square inch of it . but i can feel the edges closing in on me . a mangs life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this . so what do you say ? join me ?
okay .
beats me .
that poet , norther winslow did . he was going to paris , france . he must have liked it , because no one ever heard from him again . tell you what . you take the other way and i will cut through here . meet you on the far side .
just to be sure , you can take my pack .
make him stop .
i am a footnote in that story . i am the context for your great adventure . which never happened ! incidentally ! you were selling novelty products in wichita the day i was born .
jesus christ .
friend of yours ? did you help him out of a bind ?
come on , will . everyone likes that story .
no dad , they do not . i do not like the story . not anymore , not after a thousand times . i know all the punchlines , dad . i can tell them as well as you can . for one night , one night in your entire life , the universe does not revolve around edward bloom . it revolves around me and my wife . how can you not understand that ?
your mom says i cannot tell you that one anymore . you get nightmares .
i am not scared .
am i ?
having a kid changes everything . i mean , there s the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings . . .
did you do any of that ?
no , but i hear it is terrible . then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child , fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine .
you think i am up for it ?
you learned from the best .
really .
truly . i saw it in the eye .
the old lady by the swamp .
she was a witch .
no , she was old and probably senile . maybe schizophrenic .
i saw my death in that eye . and this is not how it happens .
so how does it happen ?
surprise ending . would not want to ruin it for you .
okay .
and every day i gave him a quarter . every day . then i got sick and was out for a couple of weeks . and when i went back there , you know what he said ?
what did he say ?
you owe me three fifty .
really .
true story .
there s a lot you do not know about me .
you are right .
you mean , while i am here .
i would just like to know the true versions of things . events . stories . you .
i will .
you know where the chemicals are ?
i used to do it when you were gone , remember ? i used to do it a lot .
i said this is not how i go . the last part is much more unusual . trust me on that .
it is rude to talk about religion . you never know who you are going to offend .
oh , so you know .
yes .
i think someone has not .
dad ?
son ?
can we talk ?
do i ? i saw an iceberg once . they were hauling it down to texas for drinking water , only they did not count on an elephant being frozen inside . the woolly kind . a mammoth .
dad !
what ?
i am trying to make a metaphor here .
then you should not have started with a question . because people want to answer questions . you should have started with , the thing about icebergs is . . .
the thing about icebergs is you only see percent of them . the other percent is below the water where you cannot see it . and that is what it is with you dad . i am only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water .
what , you are seeing down to my nose ? my chin ?
i have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact .
i have told you a thousand facts . that is all i do , will . i tell stories .
you tell lies , dad . you tell amusing lies . stories are what you tell a five year old at bedtime . they are not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty . and the thing is , i believed you . i believed your stories so much longer than i should have . and then when i realized that everything you said was impossible everything ! i felt like such a fool to have trusted you . you were like santa claus and the easter bunny combined . just as charming and just as fake .
you think i am fake .
only on the surface . but that is all i have ever seen .
it would kill you , huh ?
yourself . good , bad , everything . just show me who you are for once .
i have been nothing but myself since the day i was born . and if you cannot see that , it is your failing , not mine .
the river ?
how what happens ?
how i go .
like this .
okay . okay .
somehow , you are better . different . you are getting ready to go . and i say . . .
you say . . .
the river !
story of my life .
yes . exactly .
do not need to apologize to me . i mean , i am the luckiest person you are going to find today . . .
but you are wrong . i do know you , at least by reputation . edward bloom from ashton . see , i am actually engaged to a boy from ashton . don price . he was a few years older than you .
they are your favorite flower .
how did you get so many ?
i called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way i could get my wife to marry me .
i have the rest of my life to find out .
go out with me .
i see . we need to get you one of those plant misters . we can spray you like a fern .
there is no softer ground than town .
really .
there s a lot of expectation . i do not want to disappoint my fans .
norther , do you ever regret not making it to paris ?
i cannot imagine any place better than here .
you are a poet . you oughta be able to . and maybe if you would seen more , you could .
i was astonished to see the greatest poet of both ashton and spectre all the way out in texas .
i want you to know , when you left spectre it opened my eyes . there was a whole life out there that i was not living . so i travelled . i saw france , and africa , half of south america . every day a new adventure , that is my motto .
that is great , norther . i am happy for you . i cannot believe i helped .
i am robbing this place .
fraid so .
edward , it is got your deposit slip on it .
hello .
i was not expecting you .
i am . and you are will . i have seen your picture , that is how i recognize you . i almost said something at the store , but it would have been awkward . like this .
this was on his sales route , so he was through here all the time . everyone in town knew him .
wow . wow , you just said it . i was expecting to dance around this for another half hour .
i have seen him with women . he flirts . he always has . on some level , i presumed he was cheating on my mother . i just never had proof .
because he is dying .
my father talked about a lot of things he never did , and i am sure he did a lot of things he never talked about . i am just trying to reconcile the two .
no , it is logical if you think like your father . see , to him , there s only two women your mother and everyone else .
you did not become crazy .
well , therapy . and one day i realized i was in love with a man who could never love me back . i was living in a fairy tale .
yes .
down the hall on the right . the door sticks . you have to really pull it .
we will have to pick up a copy .
i will help you .
i need to lie down for a bit .
i know . it was the same when i was carrying will . like clockwork .
i do .
i loved it . it sounds peculiar , but i loved every minute of it . i did . eddie was travelling a lot , so he was gone , but i felt like i always had a piece of him with me . a little part of his soul inside me . i could feel it . it was alive and kicking .
it is more than they thought . they are going to stop chemo .
you need to go .
probably tonight .
you do not have to .
i am going with you .
did you ?
they met at auburn .
what about the details ? how they fell in love . the circus . the war . you never told me any of that .
that is because most of it never happened .
but it is romantic .
mmm , what ?
mmm , what . i know better than to argue romance with a french woman .
everyone loves my father . he is a very likeable guy .
do you love him ?
but it is not true .
what is true ? i have never heard my father say a single true thing .
you are not .
i need you on my side .
i am always on your side . and i think you should talk to him .
your father had a stroke . he is upstairs with your mom and dr . bennett .
is he going to be okay ?
we swam . the atlantic , it is not that big really .
ruth mchibbon offered to pick you up at the airport .
we rented a car .
you did not need to do that . you just did not .
he is up with your father .
he is impossible . he will not eat . and because he will not eat , he gets weaker . and because he is weaker , he does not want to eat .
how much time does he have left ?
you do not talk about those things . not yet .
really ! that is wonderful .
of course .
what i mean is , do you really know that is going on in his head ?
yes .
how is that possible ? i mean , you try to ask him a question and suddenly it is another one of his stories . you cannot honestly say you know him .
yes , will , i do . and do not presume things you do not know .
yes . but that is a different . . .
no it is not . it is exactly the same . your father and i met , we dated , and we married we chose each other because we understood each other on some fundamental level . just the same as you two .
yes , you both think william bloom is a very smart man . the problem is , you only see me as your mother , and not as someone s wife . and i have been his wife longer than i have been your mother . you cannot discount that .
true . but i have known him my whole life , and i do not feel like i know him at all . or ever will .
but i understand you , mom . i always have .
well , clearly you do not . but i am not the mystery you are trying to solve right now .
mom , do you know who that is ? blonde hair .
no . but it is weird . she seemed to recognize me .
do you know who that is ?
not everything your father says is a complete fabrication .
he just fell asleep . josephine s with him .
yes ?
i suppose your grandmother s house when she passed on . but we sold that right away . your cousin shirley bought it .
so you never bought any land .
heavens no . we had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place .
i will stay . why do not you go home with josephine and i will stay tonight .
that is okay ?
yes . thank you .
fifty thousand . almost exactly .
what for ?
you know what for .
no i do not .
i got you those trousers from paul smith .
i have been buying you stuff all week . i have been buying him stuff all week .
such as ?
those are not presents . that is normal friendship stuff
i paid for those guitar cases .
yeah . it was quite good actually . some bits i really liked .
the sets were good .
the sets were excellent . everything was big , you know , all the rubbish , coke cans , sweet wrappers , dustbins , so when you were watching it you felt cat size . it was really clever .
there s over eighty thousand here .
what do you mean ?
you know what i mean babe , it is enough . we can stop .
do you want to stop ?
yes .
we will stop then .
it is nothing . i burnt myself .
that is not a burn .
it is . i did it cooking .
yeah .
thank you .
you heard what i said . i am pregnant . i have been throwing up for weeks .
name it .
what are you doing here ?
leave him !
you have . you have actually fallen for this prick .
no i have not .
ch . . .
to customers approaching the bank from the rear
right .
you can see why it is sensitive ?
uh . . . yes .
i thought you could give us the tour this morning . sort of be our indian guide .
right .
hang on hang on , sorry , but like , who are you ?
you must find some glasses , small , for the toast , and some plates .
what are you doing here ?
i am asking what you are here for .
what ?
he says he feels safe here .
oh . we are russian .
yes . i know .
good .
and . . .
and what ? you mean from the beginning ? jesus . can i uh okay , as we say in russia can i cut a long story short . okay . nadia is my little cousin . except she is not . but we say cousin . this is for you .
toast first then we talk seriously , i can see you are serious about us .
of course not . alexei , he is is my problem .
right .
we better watch him . he is crazy .
right .
i am actor , he is actor , although he is an actor stroke musician . i just noodle along , i am not so good . he makes me look like a retard he smokes me . i do not mean he smokes me .
right . so i can say he smokes me . so .
so i come to england with other actors to make shows , i meet this freak from novgorod i tell him of you and chicken and the birthday here we are .
i asked her if you were happy to see us . i find it hard to tell with you .
yes it is okay . thank you for the food .
plans are for the architects , politicians and so forth .
you must have a visa or something . . .
you are asking for my documents ?
no , no . . .
uh . do you like england ?
classic ! thank god . she says yes !
what ?
i saw you waiting there , by the gate .
i . . .
i have these uh . . . she explains to you . . . when i was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses . like . . . i do not know the word . like for watching uh . . . for watching the birds .
binoculars . he had these binoculars he has kept from the war .
oh nothing .
tell me .
no . it is too judgmental .
tell me what he said .
he says why did you send to russia for a wife .
no . it is not that .
do you believe in love ?
i suppose it is . . . i mean define your terms .
it is very strange . how many people are truly themselves with their love ? it is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers . there are no marches against heartache , no ministries against loneliness , no concerts against disappointment . we look away . and still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us . the one thing we all share but do not say . look john i will show you something .
fine . i thought you were leaving today .
to be indoors on such a day . it is crime .
you can stay tonight .
i have brought you trouble . maybe i should have come alone .
good night .
john .
put the fucking kettle down . tell , yuri , tell him put it down or i am going to make him .
what ? what does he want ?
he says you are very sad ridiculous man . i do not agree of course . and that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute . nadia is a prostitute . i am sorry .
what does he want . the russian shithead . what do you want ?
he wants money .
tell him to put the kettle down and i will give him money .
i will give him money . tell him to put the . . .
he wants the money from your bank .
i will fucking give it to him ! we will go down there .
you do not understand . he wants all the money that is in your bank .
i have got eight hundred pounds . oh jesus .
he is sure you can do this . of course you can not .
oh jesus . of course i cannot .
i am so sorry .
leave her alone .
yes .
right . okay . good .
yes .
i just cannot find a nest . the root of the problem . i have looked everywhere . that is the russian for ant ? sorry that is a stupid . . . sorry . this is strange is not it .
yes .
i am pretty nervous . are you ?
yes .
i mean . . . ants . i have got a problem with ants .
yes .
i bet . what about me ? am i how you imagined ?
yes .
yes .
yes .
good . or should i speak slower ?
yes .
do you follow or should i speak slower ?
yes .
yes .
sorry ?
happy bath day .
syevodnya
happy birthday . happy birthday .
yes i know .
that is wrong ?
they go .
of course . they go . yes . yes .
they go .
you do not understand anything .
i think that about covers it . i think i have grasped the part about you being dumped though . that is got to hurt , i imagine . that is got to smart a bit . i mean strictly in my observer s capacity it seemed you two were getting on pretty fucking famously .
it is makes it easier . okay .
i do not want to know .
it makes it faster . if i do not speak to the men , they fall faster . it is pretty obvious why .
that is a relief . it is nice to know i am a regular guy .
i am going to drink my coffee . then , we are going to the police station . where there will be lawyers , loss of job , house , humiliation , gutter press , and probably prison .
they do not blame you . when a bank employee does this they understand . you get your life back . anyway i bet you hated that bank .
even so i always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me .
why else would you send off for me ? if you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute .
well as it turns out i did .
no i do not .
in the world .
i know you just want to punish me
i do . i want to very badly .
so you are just going to be vindictive
in every sense . if at all possible .
you cannot hurt me more than i am hurt already .
well , nadia , it it is all the same to you , i would like to give it a bash .
what ?
i am going to be sick . where is the . . .
what ? no you are not . .
i am going . . . i am . . . i am going to be sick .
no you are not . how . . . nice one . how dumb do you think i am ?
have you got your passport ?
what ?
shut up . have you got your passport ?
yes .
i do not have any money .
i said i do not have any .
i do not want to talk about him .
fine .
it is none of your business .
fine . absolutely . must be disappointing though . must come as a hell of a shock .
look , if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is .
oh jesus .
if what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you , then yes he does .
of course . of course . of course he does . of course . thank you . thanks .
but , you know , so what ?
he will come back .
excuse me ?
he left me my passport and ticket . it is pretty clear he wants to see me again .
yeah . i tend to tie up and abandon women i really want to see again too .
no . but you tend to tie them up .
why not ?
shut up . i am not listening .
you do not want to talk about it .
no .
okay we will not talk about it .
so . that is it like having to fuck men you hate ?
i do not hate you .
okay . let s . . . okay . okay . you have had sex with people you do not like have not you ? for money . to make money .
and ? what are you saying ?
and . it is wrong .
and who says what is wrong .
and that would be morals . that would be one s own moral sense of decency .
that is a moral orgasm john ? tell me how it feels exactly .
so . what then ? you just detach sex from everything . .
whereas wet ng wild is an emotional journey . tied and tethered . it is pretty moving huh ? like anna karenina .
listen . i did not go rooting around in your private stuff .
sometimes .
sometimes which ?
sometimes neither .
some . . . what does that mean ?
there s nothing wrong in liking sex , john .
i do not like sex . i do not think i will be having sex ever again .
why ?
well , it is just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman , or alone for that matter , makes me want to die .
so now you hate all women ?
i think it is my safest bet , do not you ?
oh . i think you will recover okay . i think you got what you paid for .
you . . .
i got what i paid for .
you did not mind too much .
so what did you want ? i think we understand each other , no ?
you do not understand me .
you do not understand you either .
get out
you are throwing me out .
get out .
you do not have to say anything
what ? i . . . i was not saying . . .
please , there s no . . . oh .
i was not saying anything .
then okay . so how old were you when you met him ?
yeah . he is a smashing bloke .
the rest of the world , john , it is not all like st . albans .
thank christ for that .
you are pretty naive if you think it is .
i am pretty naive ? look at you . you have to do all this , and what have you got to show for it ? nothing .
i do not have nothing .
well what have you got ?
no .
have you had any before ?
no .
are you scared ?
not really . maybe a little .
what ?
the thin . . . the girl with small eyes . the one in your cupboard .
it is none of your business . she did not have small eyes .
did she leave you ? come on . it is nothing to be ashamed of . who did she leave you for ? your best friend ? her boss ? a woman ? did she leave you for a woman , john ?
she is dead .
i do not know why i said that . she is not dead at all .
i do not know why i said it . i am sorry .
she is alive ?
laugh it up .
i am trying to quit .
i have got news for you . it is not working .
i smoke more these days . i smoke more when i am unhappy .
nobody s that unhappy .
maybe i want to die . do not you want me to die ?
i do not want anyone to die .
except for small eyes .
except for small eyes .
what was her name ?
that is your name ?
it is alright .
no . i think i better just go .
okay . thank you .
whatever .
please . why not ?
because it was a lie .
goodbye .
okay . promise ?
i am quitting . this will be my last one . so . goodbye .
goodbye .
you did not deserve me john buckingham .
whatever .
i am sorry .
please .
it is not mine either .
it is what you came back for .
i am not asking you to marry me .
no . what ? no . i know .
it is more like a date .
it is a long way to go for a date .

some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume . so now they have scented creams . they help moisturize a womangs skin . this one s my favorite . it is called ginger souffle . i recommend . . . applying the cream while the skin is still damp . so . . . perhaps just after a shower .

marv , let s get ronnie set up here .

i guess it could be worse . you could be coming back in a body bag .
she is around . always is .
i do not know . she is getting crazy , like she gets . begged me not to go . got real down . i just think somethings happened . like she run off with someone . you would tell me if you knew something , right ?

you need a ride ?
she ever tell you she was thinking of taking off ?
i just been so mixed up lately , gill . and , you know , with her history , i can see how she could get scared . . . . . . and run .
that is not right , really , cuz i . . .
you joined up in that monkey troop cuz you had a plan for yourself . army would pay for school . you were gonna get a degree , maybe something in business or agriculture and you were gonna make something of yourself .
now wait . . .
with all she was doing . with all the shit she kept doing ! you stayed stuck to that bitch s ass and you would not let go .
i know about how she was like . but we was different . i s the only person she talked to about it . how she is abused . terrible things , gill , just terrible . . .
it is not her fault , gill . she is had to take care of me all this time , cuz i would just start throwing up . . . choking . just losing my grip . and she listened . she listened to me . and . . . i got better . i do not get nervous like i used to . and since we been together . . . she been faithful to me . put all that junk behind her . . .
the only thing that cunt s had behind her is me and half the town fucking her . your first night away , i come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to . you were not gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her . like she was having some kind a fit .

cannot be thinking bout him every second of my day . i will go outta my gourd .

what ? i called bojo , like you say . called up the fellas in the band . . .
the fuck are all these people doing here ? been drinking in this shit hole for years ai not seen this many people since i do not know . . .
i just know how you get . good to know , them butterflies still in ya gut .
we ai not here to talk about that shit .
i do not know , but i been told , them georgia women sweet jelly roll .
i do .
get me ten bags of mulch .
yes sir .
naw . . . i got it , mr . lazarus . you wanna tip me , best do it in butter beans . momma say she need a bag a yours , none of that store bought junk . that is what she said .
why she got a chain on her ?
that is between her and me . it is private . and i do not want you going off and telling ya daddy .
please do not tell my daddy .
my mouth is shut , boy . and that is how we gonna keep it . do not go bragging to ya buddies , ya heard me ?
yes sir .
you struck some gold , did not ya ?
well , dig in , son . got plenty to eat .
i gotta ask you . why do you think laz is keeping you chained like this ?
you know how , like they say , you save someone s life , you responsible for them . guess he just do not think it is safe for me .
so he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from ending up bleeding on the side of the road again , without a stitch of clothing on is . . . you think he is crazy for thinking that ?
that is right .
can i ask you a question ? people always say , you gotta get good with jesus , if you want not to go to hell . that you say sorry for all you done and . . . and jesus would let you go on to heaven .
you could put it that way .
but that is so fucking stupid . i am sorry . did not mean to curse .
that is on your mind ?
you cannot hurt people . . . and then just say , i am sorry , and then everything just gets washed away . why would heaven want people like that . people who . . . do what they want and then . . . switch .
i am gonna tell you something , and it is just gonna be between you and me . i think folks carry on about heaven too much . like it is some all you can eat buffet up in the clouds . and folks just gonna do as they are told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates . i can go to shoney s for that .
rae , look at ronnie . and tell him how you feel .

all my life i been putting out your fires , with you giving out your snatch to every wagging dick in this town . and you gonna lay the blame at my feet ? well , i ai not gonna take that .
but . . . momma . . . just tell me . . . not gonna be mad . . . we can just talk about it . . . be eye to eye on this . . . you do not even got to say you are sorry . . . just say how you knew . . .
only thing i am sorry for is listening to my parents and having you instead of doing what i should a done .

home .
cavello . ronnie cavello .
so why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust ?
let go . . .
get rid of it .
why ?
it is not regulation . and the only way you are gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him , and while he is laughing , you can shove it down his throat .
i will get rid of it when you get rid of the egg beater .
charlie . . .
i should tear your head off .
whoa , i knew you were going to say that . i absolutely anticipated that , nick . but i said to myself , charlie , charlie , we can move up on this , so go find nicklaus . . . he will be pissed for a moment , but then it will dawn on him
hey , i got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up .
eating scungilli , just like the last time you asked .
who do you think the jap is ?
maybe cavello s buying a subaru . how would i know ?
i do not blame you for being sore . it will pass when we bag him .
what ?
the wolf ?
maybe we should do something ?
charlie , take your gum , stick it under your ass and keep it warm .
saving your life .
i was thinking the poconos , charlie . maybe vegas .
what are you missing ? riding your motorcycle to the nurse s house . that shit is sadder than ethiopia .
beats forty hours on a plane .
they say we got to turn around and come right back . that is what they say . i got a plan .
not a prayer .
hey , come on , big guy like you , cop from new york . you are gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since godzilla .
where is the subway station , please .
no .
number five with a bullet .
go to sleep , charlie .
you did not take , did you . . . ? you hear things .
i did not know .
the lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad . i was new , did not know shit . when the feathers flew , i got called in front of the special prosecutor . it is on the top of my personnel file . they think i am dirty or i cut a deal . does not leave you with a lot of friends either way .
hey , when in rome
in rome , i will bow .
nick , we cannot just
i said let s go , charlie .
let s grab some food .
first decent idea you have had .
you said that in the last two places .
i hope not .
i would feel better if we had some heat .
maybe we should bail ?
i do not think he would feel it .
he could not find his ass with both hands .
sure , a rice burning crotch rocket . . .
nick , how we gonna bag this guy without any help ? maybe i should work on that girl joyce , she speaks the language .
pussy , ass , soft personnel .
what would she say ?
that i should let you pay for the drinks . kampai .
cool ?
you all right ? you okay ?
what does charlie mean ?
hey , all right .
yeah . . . i came to save you . if you are hopeless , i will pull the plug .
connie . . .
all right , how is the new partner ?
high spirits , desire , commitment .
you will take care of that .
give me a break , would you ?
if you give me one .
i was not expecting you .
where would you look for the mafia ?
the mayor s office , under the bed , the back room at lombardi s . and call me ich .
jerry lee lewis , elvis , dinky doo and the do not s . let s book , charlie . if he starts on motown , we will be here all night .
no , this is the place for the young yakuza .
that is what you said in the last three piss pots .
that is the problem here ?
give us a break . . .
it is ichiro . ich .
leave the rice cake outside and go home !
i do not deserve ohashi s respect .
why the hell not ?
i do not , that is all .
they made you leave your hotel . . . . . . you caused a disturbance .
why were not you at the platform ?
i could not keep up . my shame is complete .
yeah . . .
i will get him for you , nick .
i can see that .
i stole them .
we can ask someone i used to work with . a criminal . someone i pay money to . . .
a snitch ?
he says they are very nice . he wants to know if you have anymore .
only one way to find out . . . get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night .
no . do not say anything . do not do anything , and for christ s sake , do not apologize !
nick . . .
there she is !
you toler yes , tolerate me .
are we getting married ?
sure .
if you are gonna give me a hard time , wait outside .
four goddamn days . this is going nowhere . . .
ichiro
broiled fish paste cake , kelp roll , soybean curd , devils tongue
smells like bayonne at low tide .
good . very good . . .
you were too far behind .
gaiijin .
i will check it out .
you can trust me .
we are through . i mean it . this is the end of the line , matsumoto .
nick
shut up .
i want to yank kobo .
not without a small army , nicklaus san .
san is an honorable title .
a few minutes faster , we might have nailed him .
a resort city , beppu .
i want to go talk to him .
what . . . ? why ?
because he knows how to get to our man .
he will never speak to a gaiijin .
i will be a nice gaiijin .
big enough .
it is illegal , nick .
it is a new deal . . . . coming with me tomorrow ?
sugai s not going to be impressed with your gun , nick . no . i will not put myself in danger for you anymore .
for sugai . caviar , french cheese , ham . . . if you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting , sugai may feel obligated to see you .
so i bring some cheese ?
let s go . him first .
nick , you cannot do this .
it is done . you do not have to come .
no .
not now , man , okay , not now . work with me .
i cannot . . .
kampai .
i called ohashi , he will be waiting . i like him waiting .
i followed them . an hour from the train station .
how many men ?
i could not tell .
joyce ?
i do not know .
we need the plate to negotiate with .
now we have got nothing to negotiate with .
a wife . she left .
i am sorry .
me too .
luck .
why s that ?
because we are the biggest things to hit this town since godzilla .
yes . . .
call for help .
joyce , give the assistant chief inspector a drink , would you ?
we cannot lose .
how can you be so sure ?
he gets as much as he wants .
there was a change in plans .
gaiijin ?
an outside person . a foreigner . a barbarian . you , me . more you .
i could use some help . show me around . i will pay you for your time .
i do not give tours .
you have a helluva way of asking for help .
you have a helluva way of answering .
maybe i am a quicker learner .
i do not think so .
sure , but then i just pull out the photos .
he is on duty .
i paid for that .
somebody must be suffering somewhere , you are being so nice .
where is ich ?
unavailable .
i need someone to translate for me .
my japanese is not that hot . . . besides , you will never get in .
it is my last shot . i have to be on a plane home tomorrow night .
and i am supposed to care ?
you could fake it .
he drinks .
he is got a reason .
you met her .
what do you chant ?
nam oyo ranged kyo . you think it is dumb of course .
not if it works . i will meet you at the train ?
i do not remember saying yes .
i do not remember you saying no .
who am i supposed to be ?
this little guy thinks you are robert redford . . . the other one thinks you are charles bronson . . .
tell them i am not .
the cheese . . .
no one s keeping him here .
bullshit , nick . and do not tell me this is all just about charlie . it is not .
why would you care ?
what if i chant ?
would not help . watch out for ich .
last time you asked me to come along i nearly got a hole in my head .
might be different in new york .
maybe . if i come visit , we can find out .
i would like that .
i am taking you back .
save it , i already took the tour .
you are a lucky man . where you come from a man can stand out . it is expected . here a man is made to look a fool for standing out .
guess i am on a roll .
she is such a long way home for you .
time , i have got plenty of .
i am amused .
do not be .
then take it from him .
this by this . . .
dope ?
not in that company .
the old man was a japanese paper manufacturer . hotel room and rental car were full of it .
yeah .
thought you knew your way around dark alleys , detective .
why ?
he is wanted in japan . they want him first . then we can have him .
what ?
what . . . ? what if i say no ?
check your gun before you leave . they are not allowed in japan . it is a nice , safe country .
why me ?
they said send a detective if i could spare one . i can always spare you .
he was my partner .
they are blaming it on you . christ , conklin , you did not even tell me you lost the prisoner !
i planned on catching him , captain .
how ? you do not know the place . you do not know the language . get on the plane .
he killed a police officer .
your plane s at nine a . m . be on it . that is orders . period .
right .
incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms , carrying official documents .
it is not allowed .
we are police officers .
you are foreigners .
work with me . i want your best detective .
do you know what this is ?
why do not you ask your chief detective ?
the young are eating the old , something that usually does not happen here .
can we skip the poetry , inspector ?
your visa has expired . be on a plane in twenty four hours or you will be deported .
while you were hanging out at the visa office , we found the son of a bitch .
look .
twenty four hours , detective .
for god s sake , ohashi , i need your help . let me out of here !
you had my help , detective .
if anything happens to her while i am here
do you know where she is , detective ? do you know how to find her ? even where to start ? we will find them .
i have to get to sugai .
goodbye , officer .
i am impressed . but let s use the short form . i am looking for
kobo . . . i know . he killed two of my partners . one in new york , one at the printing plant .
i want him .
he will be dealt with .
the families who control the casinos ?
yes . unlike our syndicates , your criminals do not understand the words honor and woulduty . . . we cannot afford not to deal with them .
the feds would be onto you in a month .
not with these bills . and even if it only took them six months , do you know what our profit margin would be ?
the other plate is currently in new york , in the hands of kobo s man . find it for me .
you trust me ?
i will pay you .
swiss bank deposit . gold bullion . whatever you want . you know the city and the police .
if i say no ?
you are smarter than kobo . you know the price of deceit . think about it .
i do not have to .
he will find out you took me . i am unprotected . he will kill us . all of us . you do not stand a chance .
you want him dead too .
after a court convicts him . he belongs to me .
we were worried to death . it is awfully kind of you .
you certainly have a nice place here .
well stocked .
if he will not cooperate ?
mr . sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated . we will appreciate him and he will cooperate .
i do not think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us .
pris ?
where ?
anywhere .
not to be trapped .
you underestimate the trap , mary .
then go get him .
that would not be very sporting .
oh ?
here s your check , my boy . thank you .
it is not an easy thing to meet your maker .
and what can he do for you ?
can the maker repair what he makes ?
would you like to be modified ?
had in mind something a little more radical .
that is the problem ?
death .
i am afraid that is a little out of my . . .
come here .
why ?
because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies like rats leaving a sinking ship . the ship sinks .
what about e . m . s . recombination ?
we have already tried it ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table .
would not obstruct replication , but it does give rise to an error in replication , so that the newly formed dna strand carries a mutation and you are got a virus again . . . but all this is academic you are made as good as we could make you .
but not to last .
put it this way . rolls royces are made to last as least they were . but i am afraid you are a ferrari . a high strung racing car built to win , not to last .
i am ?
also extraordinary things .
nothing the god of biomechanics would not let you in heaven for .
well , no , not really . there s mr . deetchum , he is the watchman , he lives on the first floor .
if it would not be too much of a bother . . . a little bite to eat would be . . .
oh , no bother , i would be glad to .
well , actually
you are just all so . . . so different .
you are androids .
nexus .
like what ?
like . . .
you mean that you cannot come here and i cannot go there ?
not only that , but we have smiliar problems . accelerated decrepitude . but we do not want to die quite yet .
of course not .
you could help us .
i do not know much about biomechanics , roy . i wish i did , but you are out of my league .
if we do not find help soon , pris has not got long to live .
dr . tyrell ?
tyrell could help us , sebastian .
he could ?
his company made us .
i would be happy to mention it to him .
be better if i could talk to him in person . but he is not an easy man to get to .
no .
when do you deliver your project ?
this afternoon .
thank you .
just thought i would . . .
no , you stay here with us . out last night together .
he is not ready yet .
when ?
tomorrow , he says .
hello , glad to meet you .
not if everybody is doing their job here at home . how are things at home ?
very good , pris . now show him why .
okay , but do not kill him . save a little for everybody . a masterpiece .
five . three nights ago one of them managed to break into the tyrell corporation . killed two guards and got as far as the genetic sector before he got fried going through an electro field .
what was he after ?
there was not much left of him , so we cannot be sure . but bio chemical data and morphology records of the nexus were reported missing . going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send holden in to run voight kampff tests on the new employees . guess he found himself one .
we are using esper a that picked up holdengs alarm . its guess is that all five are in the city .
where do we start ?
what was the cover on the one that got holden ?
industrial refuse .
garbage man ?
bryant here . regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants , esper s concluded that the only irregular category that tyrell s got is the entertainment section . you better get on it .
i was just about to have my dinner .
if you hurry you will get back before it gets cold . i got a spinner on your roof in five minutes . good luck .
then let her get away . i thought you were a pro you are supposed to be a fucking tracker !
you did not like her ! ?
yeah .
this is bryant . are you alone ?
yeah .
she is not with you ?
who .
got it .
okay , here it is . eldon tyrell , his family and half his staff were just massacred . the cat is about to get out of the bag . pressure is definitely on . the nexus program is terminated . when you finish there , locate nexus designated rachael and retire .
yeah . i got it .
go .
your customer , eh ?
soon as i finish the job .
when might that be ?
day after tomorrow .
oh ! day after tomorrow .
this is esper and i am ready . go ahead please .
why , yes , of course .
you start .
the five in question are third generation nexus sixes , constructed of skin flesh culture , selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self perpetuating thought , para physical abilities and developed for emigration program . are you with me ?
how do i stop one ?
unlike a five , they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another . sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run ,
okay , but . . .
i am coming to that . vulnerable zone is the base of the skull , the occipital bone . a direct hit is a positive retirement .
i know all that .
what about a summary then .
i think we are through for the night .
do you have something against science ?
not if it works .
and what in your estimation works ?
the umbrella .
never mind . do they have that knowledge ?
longevity is classified . no .
nexus designated mary incept november , domestic conditioning non competitive , trained for day care position .
next .
nexus designated pris incept data december , competitive , programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers .
number three .
nexus designated zhora incept june th , athletic conditioning , highly competitive , special abilities in the entertainment field .
it is okay . forget it .
but i would like to buy you drink .
i will but you one . what will you have ?
vodka !
shot of vodka , please .
thank you very much .
my pleasure .
prosit .
sorry , do not have the time .
no problem .
ya .
two months . but this one is not guy . it is girl . his girl .
prosit .
no thanks .
i like you too .
one more , eh ?
i gotta piss .
i do not know .
four years .
well , you do not have to worry about getting it wrinkled .
sorry .
hey , it is okay . i like to pee . so how are you doing ?
i am doing okay .
from what i hear you are doing great . bryant tells me you are going like a god damn one man army . making a lot of money , huh ?
yeah . but that is what i wanted to talk to you about .
money ?
no . i got a problem .
let s hear it .
i think i am starting to empathize with these nexus sixes .
i am taking a piss .
these are not just . . .
i know what they are , deck look , maybe they can pretend to feel , but far as the raw , hot emotions of the old heart no way .
no rust ?
i did not say that . your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time .
meaning ?
meaning you do not run as fast as you used to .
yeah ?
your mind kept wandering . that bothered me .
huh huh .
considering the nature of your work , that could be unhealthy .
true .
nope .
you are going to be over the limit .
listen , i could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but i still rather be here than up there .
what if you change your mind ?
they will change the limit before i change my mind .
you sure ?
never been more sure of anything in my life .
too old .
but if you could ?
me too .
yes ?
can i come in ?
of course .
do you recognize any of them ?
what did she want ?
who ?
the girl that does not look like that girl .
nothing . she wanted to know about suck night .
what night ?
i did not know if i wanted to handle her i already got a snake act . but my partner goes down there to the opera house on suck night to book the good ones .
that is suck night ?
that is what we call in the trade , audition free for alls and most of it sucks . bit i do not think that is her .
you talking about the opera house on the main ?
lots of places . the tours , the clubs , the silicone shows , private parties .
what shows ?
silicone valley . lots of these science guys never leave that place . we book two shows a month in there . those big time techs and bio guys might be real high zoners up here , but when it comes to the arts , they like it loud and lewd .
i am with the american federation of variety artists . . .
i do not know nothing about it .
you have not felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way ?
like to get this position . did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person ?
are you for real ?
oh , yeah . you would be surprised what goes on around here . i would like to check the dressing room if i could .
what the fuck for ?
for holes .
of course he is not real . you think i would be working here if i could afford a real snake ?
it is a good job .
you mean the snake .
does it eat ?
come on .
sorry .
hey ! do your job but do not wreck mine , huh ?
i bet i would .
little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress .
and who do i go to about you ?
a humanoid robot is like any other machine , it can be a benefit or a hazard . if it is a benefit , it is not our problem .
but because your department cannot do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large , it is a problem . correct , mr . deckard ?
of course not .
why should i be ?
for the responsibility of your power . being a police bureaucrat , you have got more than your share .
you have a little boy . he shows you his butterfly collection , plus the killing jar .
you are watching t . v . and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist .
i would kill it .
is this testing whether i am an android or a lesbian ?
you show the picture to your husband . he likes it and hangs it on the wall . the girl is lying on a bearskin rug .
i would never get an abortion .
why not ?
that would be murder , mr . deckard .
in your opinion .
it would be my child .
sounds like you speaks from experience .
ugh .
i know you think it complicates your work , but i am here to help .
i have already got more help than i need .
i think you need more help than you have got .
sounds like i am an ass hole either way , but the answer is still no .
two of us might be more effective than one .
i work alone .
so ?
so , i am a piece of equipment . use me .
yeah .
i am sorry .
can you ? i could not .
right .
what do you want me to do ?
sit .
there s a lot i have not done with a man before .
you did ?
you did not hear me . you were sleeping .
me and my dad .
where is he ?
dead .
oh .
i am . part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out .
how are you doing ?
not too good .
if they are smart , they take naps .
yeah . sometimes .
i wish i could .
yeah .
that is another thing i cannot do .
it was not very good last night , was it ?
i do not know , i have nothing to compare it to . i guess i thought there was something more to it .
what ?
i do not know . . . i think i missed something .
like ?
i am not sure . is there a secret ?
hmmm ?
have you ever cleaned your apartment ?
do not be fooled by appearances .
it appears to be dirty why do not you get somebody ?
i do not like people snooping around my stuff .
never mind the plug , just go through the motions .
but then how can you . . .
i do not like the noise . just practice . practice makes perfect .
good for a smart girl to feel stupid . part of your education .
i never felt better .
you mean a woman ?
uh huh .
that is a long time ?
ten years .
nope . nobody could stand me that long .
because it is not .
do not you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered ?
andies only simulate suffering if they are programmed for it .
do you think i simulated what happened between us ?
no , i do not .
what difference will it make ?
just wait here .
what ?
that some of the folks around here are more programmed then me .
you know where i been . i been on vacation .
next time you go on vacation , do me a favor , let us know where it is .
that is up ?
holden got hit .
severed spine . you would better get in here . bryant s waiting for you .
i will see you in a minute .
black ?
please .
yes .
capillary dilation of the so called blush response ? plus fluctuation of the pupil , plus involuntary dilation of the iris ?
go ahead .
have you ever retired a human by mistake ?
no .
but in your profession that is a risk .
nothing is infallible , but so far the voight kampff scale bas been foolproof .
like you said , mr . deckard , a machine can be a hazard . the voight kampff scale is a machine , is not it ?
one that relies on human interpretation . where is the subject ?
sitting next to you .
if she is , the machine works .

how about this one ?
yeah , sweet . that is a nice way of putting it .
what do i say to miss sweet when i meet her ?

gladly .
oh , my holy stars ! a negro !

oh , you got a problem with that ?

i will go up .
i will be all right .
you are my brave boy .
yes , ma am .
i just hope this is still good up there .
mom ?
i was thinking that , uh . . . you know , while i was up there and all . . . that maybe i could , you know . . . try to meet a girl . i have , been thinking about that a little . . . just these last . . . fifteen years or so .
yes , ma am .
yes , ma am .
your father has a few final words for you . you know , he would fight a buzz saw for you he loves you so much . we both do .
heck , i know that mom ! you are my parents .
are you in trouble , son ? !
i think i am being chased by a psychiatrist .
a psychiatrist ? !
what ?
i cannot explain it now . but i want you to set the locks for two months . you have more than enough of everything . then we will be back to get you .
no , wait ! at least stay for dinner !
no , mom , i have turned it into dad s office .
well , where are you
eve and i . . . eloped . we are married .
no .
yes .
he will catch him . hi . this is nina aron . i have got a run away and i am going to need police assistance .
no ! not the police ! do not call them !
i have to . if a complaint is made and the person resists obser
no , i cannot have that ! they will come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs
calm down , please . this man needs help and you need protection from him . that is obvious .
you know , i do not think so . i am confused but you know , i do not think he would ever hurt me . i do not think he would hurt anyone .
and now you must let me be the judge of that !
i was frightened and i did not know what to think ! but you know i believe him . i think he just wants to go home . wherever the hell that is . . .
let s all remain calm . that is the key thing .
well , he and mrs . nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit .
unless we get a postcard or something , that is my guess .
what about relatives ?
all back east .
the neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here . she would bring him sandwiches and hot dr . pepper .
he drank it hot ?
yeah .
good god .
yeah .
what ? ! a light ! yes , i have got a light !
good .
the blast ? honey , i have survived a host of things . like the song says a country boy can survive !
yes , yes , the song . so tell me . . . has it been . . . hell up here ?
hell up here ? honey , it is been hell up here , down there and over yonder ! hell everywhere .
yes , i can tell that just looking around . boy ? did you say you were a country boy ?
cute little old man , if you want a boy , i can be a boy . and if you want a girl , i can be a girl . i can be anything you want me to be !
really ?
uh huh . and it is all yours for the remarkably low price of only ! and if you act now , i might even throw in some free lawn furniture .
no , i cannot . i am sorry ! i have to go ! i have to . . .
sorry , honey ! i just got to fooling with this darn rheostat .
well , put it down and come in !
you bet , hon !
we will do this again ! maybe next week . here s your hat . could i wrap something up for you ? did you have a coat ?
time ? oh , no calvin . it is not time yet . i still have
did you rig it to do that ? you are so clever .
no . they all do .
i never know anymore .
yes .
i just hope those plates are not radioactive by tomorrow morning .
cheese is particularly troublesome .
worse than your kraft holiday dip ?
oh , much worse . but not as bad as that mexican jumping bean dip . you remember that ?
yeah , yeah . okay . give me the roast and watch your step . i will come back for the radio .
i do not know . for this thing to blow over , it could take days .
days ? ?
rather safe than sorry . that is my motto !
but , what if i go into labor ? that could happen any time .
i have read up on it . i will deliver the baby myself if i have to .
now you listen to me calvin webber , when this baby comes , you are going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers .
yes , dear !
as long as we have got that straight .
to you maybe .
the locks .
the locks ?
to keep us from trying to leave . after an atomic blast there s a radiation half life that lasts thirty five years .
thirty five years !
then after that it is safe .
it is safe .
to go up .
no .
we have to be strong , sweetheart . if not for ourselves , for the child .
all our friends . . .
i am not hungry .
hot dr . pepper ! your favorite !
no , calvin , you are favorite .
really ?
how could you ? ! this is just like home !
would you like a tranquilizer ?
you have tranquilizers ?
i told you ! i have got everything !
what ?
uh , oh . now it is time .
honey ?
no , calvin . babies cry .
i have noticed .
what shall we call him ?
and i was wondering . . . if . . . if i could have a . . .
yes !
if i . . . you know . . .
what ? whatever you want , helen !
right here !
we looked all over for you . what are you doing back here ?
oh , i was just examining this rear hatchway .
why ?
no reason . well , it is pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off . so , you know , when the time is up , we will have to return to the surface using , you know , this back entrance . which is very nice because it has the service elevator !
very nice . unless it caved in , too .
yes . well . . . yes .
what ?
yes , he is very bright , dear . much like his father . but you know , calvin , maybe he is a little . . . young for school .
nonsense . people have no idea what the human mind is capable of . look at us !
oh , calvin , i am not sure we should be making promises that perhaps cannot be kept .
i believe there will be other survivors . in fact , i am guessing there s life on the surface , even now . it is not life worth living perhaps , but believe me , something s moving around up there . and i do not just mean the cockroaches .
hi .
coming !
you bet .
and i made these !
if he tells , it will not come true !
oh , that is just a bunch of baloney ! we never believed that in my family !
well , we did in my family !
calvin webber ! what a thing to say !
well , we will be going up in two years . we will know then . i am very hopeful .
yeah . let s dig in !
yes . . .
you know , when we do go up . . . i am going to miss this old place . how about you , hon ?
would you excuse me ?
sure .
oh , yes . it just fascinates me how all these things work .
i know exactly what you mean ! hey , honey ?
just open the door .
it is an archaic colloquialism , roughly meaning . . . good .
yes ! that is right !
mutants ? !
it is not a pretty sight . some eat out of garbage cans . others are . . . cover your ears , son , and hum . i mean that literally and i mean right now !
no .
yes .
i do not believe it !
oh my . oh , my , oh my , oh , my . so , what do we do now ?
we stay down here .
we do ?
yes .
excuse me .
we will make do . i am of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then
no , calvin . we are not going to make do . not me ! not adam . we are going up no matter what ! we deserve it . even if it is terrible !
well , i am the head of this household
i want him to at least see the sky !
and we will
and the ocean ! a mountain range !
do as i say !
yes , dear , i know .
amen .
i thought ten years .
well , that is . . . considerably shorter than before . i was wondering , calvin , why set the locks at all . i mean the radiation is gone and . . .
to keep that is up there from getting down here ! it is not the radiation i am worried about .
some time .
what can i offer you , eve ?
what are you doing here ?
i forgot some of my stuff .
your stuff ? let me see that .
hey , they are ralph laurens . and who s this interesting looking fellow ?
this is adam . adam , meet cliff .
shana gillroy s apartment . remember her ? the model who went to harvard ? well , i better get going ! bye , adam . nice coat !
you know , i do not know . and looking at you , i do not care . it is been too long , eve .
yeah . before i kick your ass .
i guess we should not fight in here .
i knew you would like him .
darling , this is x file stuff ! think about it ! the guy s got all this easily negotiable property . he is obviously setting something up very big . like a self sustaining island off the coast of south america , for instance . or perhaps he is the head of a cult that is doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco . i have heard worse .
out of town . that is all he will say .
oh , yes .
i even guessed his hotel , did not i ?
oh , my god . . .
exactly . you understand that , do not you ? you have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that .
money is no object . he is got cards up the wazoo .
that is that supposed to mean ?
it means that your taste in mengs apparel is as bad as your taste in men .
well , that is blunt !
i am sorry . but if the shoe fits .
and i suppose you see him in some sort of strapless thing , do not you ?
i see elegant .
yeah ? like ralph lauren ?
that is what i am sensing .
i am busy tomorrow anyway . i have to buy six thousand paper napkins .
what do you think , adam ?
i think . . . it . . . works .
let me show you the entire trousseau !
no .
he is from alaska .
always good advice .
for him . it does not work for the rest of us .
eve ? !
well , i am trying to educate him ! it is nothing personal .
adam , i think for you , we should go for sweet .
it is not so much what you say but how you say it . women like men who are unpredictable .
right here ? well , you are being so bossy i was not sure !
uh . . he might of .
we did not leave together .
who did he leave with ?
i am his pimp . he left with the dancers , did not he ?
hey , you are the psychic . eve , the psychic pimp . you tell me .
those sluts !
yeah . but who s not a slut these days ?
to bed .
to bed ?
yeah . i am not the one who s in love with the guy .
what ? ! now hold on ! wait one damn minute !
yes , you do .
and i do not fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards ! !
uh , yes , you do .
or pee in their pants when they see the ocean !
yes , you do !
or have perfect table manners .
you know , i asked him about that . and he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them . see , you would eat like a slob if you were alone , but since another human being is present , you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners . i did not know that . i thought it was a way of appearing superior . know what else he told me ?
what ?
he thinks that i am a gentleman and that you are a lady !
well , consider the source . i do not even know what a lady is .
exactly ! i thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses . turns out , the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible . that is it ! if you do not do that , nothing else matters . the cars , the clothes , the houses . . .
where did he get all that information ?
from the oddest place . his parent s told him . i do not think i got that memo .
so now i suppose he is trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible .
he did not leave with them .
well . . . i admit it . i am glad to hear that .
he left with sophie .
what ? ! !
it is true . she swept him out the door whispering little french things into his ear .
oh , no ! not sophie ! no way ! please do not tell me that ! !
you are goddamn right i am !
coward !
i know . . . i know . you did the right thing .
what ? !
oh . well , you are . . . certainly welcome !
fallout shelter .
give it back to him .
and if we cannot find him ?
we will find him .
i do not know . everything s so neat . it is all just so . . . goddamn dear . damn !
see these ? found them in the box with the cards . these are stock certificates . ibm . at t . polaroid .
have him committed .
yeah ! that is thinking .
he was always so nice ! how was i supposed to know that is a good thing ? ! nice is weird ! nice is . . . what is nice ? it is not cool ! i will tell you that . was it ever ?
i do not know . i like to think so .
well , at least i fell for him before i found out he was rich ! that is new . wait a minute ! he said today he knew where home was . what happened this morning ? ! where did you go ? !
to get some frozen poultry .
then what ?
we came back to the house !
you did not stop anywhere else ? !
no . no , wait a minute . we stopped at a porno store .
what ? !
an adult bookstore . he was very excited about seeing it . you think home is under a dirty bookstore in the valley ?
come on .
none of this stuff was here in . the valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards .
well , we have come a long way , have not we ? i want to go home .
yeah . maybe he will call .
where ? !
stop !
you bet , mom ! coming up !
uh . . . yeah . it is like hard .
um . . . uh . . .

yeah ! yeah , that is it !
i will give it to ya , no money down . the neighborhood has gone to hell anyway .

i will get a coat for her .
looks like you would make a good runner .
well .
i mean , you do not exactly have the build for a football . i mean , no offense .
i mean , some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered .
yeah , well i never wanted to get slaughtered much .
well , most guys do not . i mean that is the point . you all mind if i take my vitamins ?
later mike . i gotta take care of someone who s hurt here , in case you have not noticed .
hey jeff .
uh uh .
are you feeling okay ?
uh uh .
it is good to see you , dad .
hey jeff . i am feeling so much better .
good deal dad .
i just know , that is all . i remember you from central .
you were pretty popular . did not you run for some office ?
yeah i did , treasurer . should not you be studying or something .
am i bothering you ?
no . you are not bothering me . you a senior ?
yes .
how is central these days ?
terrible boring .
what else is new ? right ?
yeah . what are you doing now ?
i am home from school . my father s in the hospital .
that is too bad .
what do you know about the ear ? anything ?
did not my father tell you not to talk about it ?
come on , you brought it up . do you know anything ?
i do not really know much but bits and pieces . i hear things . my room is right above my father s office . the ear , there s no corpse in the morgue missing an ear , and it did come off a living person . that is direct from the coroner s office . the person is unknown . there are a couple of cases i get mixed up on , but i think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear . i heard some of the same names .
do you know who was brought in for questioning ?
there were at least three , maybe four . but a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear . there s also a business man over by the franklin factory district that was questioned . and a musician . and some others .
were all these people questioned this afternoon ?
no , this has been going on for some time . several months . about six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river . they were from people who were reported missing . they never found one complete body , only parts .
the ear is from a missing person maybe ?
maybe so .
it is a strange world is not it ? do you know what building the woman lives in ?
yeah . it is close by , that is that is creepy . they have had her under surveillance for a couple of months , except i do not know what they have found out because my father is not in charge of her .
i guess you have to get back home soon ?
not really , why ? you want to see the building ? come on , i will show you .
where are they ?
i do not know , you are not supposed to see them . they are supposed to see you .
i do not know , like i said , she is not my father s case .
oh yeah . what about those other people ? anything ?
my father is watching the businessman . the businessman had a partner who disappeared . left his whole business and family , his wife and two kids . they think he is been murdered .
you really do hear a lot , do not you ?
yeah , i guess so . what are you going to do now that you are home ?
i have to help out in my father s hardware store . they are giving me sort of my own hours for a while , which is nice .
still , it must be kinda rough .
it is not bad , but it is bad enough . it is a lot worse for my father . i used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world .
i do not know . he moved away .
thanks for the tour . it was nice talking to you .
i guess so . like you said . it is a strange world .
yeah . good bye .
i do not know .
i would like to talk to you about something .
just a minute , pull over and wait a minute .
i am here , are not i ?
i guess mike s got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon .
ooooo , you are smart . just do not get too smart .
there are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience . sometimes , in some cases , it is necessary to take a risk . i got to thinking . i will bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that womangs apartment , you know , sneak in and hide and observe .
you said it was a strange world . and you are the strangest part of it . are you crazy ? she is possibly involved in murder . this gives me the creeps .
settle down . i have a plan which i think will work . there is very little for you to do , but i do need your help . are not you curious about my plan ?
it would not hurt to hear the plan , i guess .
alright . the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that i could crawl into later .
now , how are you going to do that ?
right out in the car i happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig . i will go to her apartment and be the pest control man . i will spray her apartment . after a few minutes you will knock on her door , drawing her attention away from me and i will then jimmy a window .
what will i say when she comes to the door ?
you will be a jehovah s witness . i have a few awake magazines for you . you do not have to keep her very long . a few seconds is all i will need . whatiya think ?
i do not know , it sounds like a good daydream , but actually doing it is too weird . too dangerous .
let s just try the first part . if that goes well , we will see about the rest . no one will suspect us , because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this .
you have got a point there .
alright .
let s go .
oh brother . dorothy vallens , seventh floor . look on the mailbox for her number , bright boy .
thanks . dorothy vallens . okay , goodluck . three minutes , no sooner .
alright . good luck , yourself .
yeah , let s get outta here . what happened ?
yes and no . did you recognize him ?
no . i only saw his back . he went down another stairwell at the end of the hall .
i did not get a good look at him either , but he sure looked at me . i did not have time to get a window , but i found this key . pretty nifty , huh ?
yeah , if it opens the door .
yeah .
pretty clever . are you game for more ?
i owe you , since i goofed up this one .
you did not goof it up , but you still owe me one . i want to sneak in tonight . it is friday , do you have a date tonight ?
yes . i do .
well , it is friday night and you are a beautiful girl . i guess you would have a date , that does that .
i do not want you to get involved , really , i mean , i do , but if something went wrong i mean , like you said , they may be involved in murder .
first of all , we will have a nice dinner . try to find out where dorothy sings .
i already know . the slow club . it is on route .
great . i will pick you up around eight o clock . is that good ?
yeah , but do not pick me up . my father may think it is strange . i will walk over to your house . i will be there at eight o clock .
okay . you better get out before someone sees us .
first of all , we are going to the slow club to see dorothy vallens . we will watch her for awhile . i would like to hear her sing anyway , and then also we will know she is there and not in her apartment .
brilliant .
then we will drive back to her apartment and i will plant myself there .
this is not my usual friday night !
two .
i will drink to that .
why not ?
it is crazy and dangerous . my god , i should not have told you .
it will be okay . i do not think you should wait out here though . i think you should go home . can you drive this car ?
yeah , but .
leave it in the front of your house for me , okay ?
ok .
could you wait a little while , this key may not fit .
i wish you would not do this . it does not make any sense . let s go somewhere and have some coffee .
i am going in , sandy . i will see you tomorrow and tell you how it went .
i , i do not want to see you tomorrow . mike s coming over .
oh , okay , can i call ?
okay , yeah , call .
look , it can wait till sunday .
call tomorrow . it is okay . good luck . i hope you can sneak out okay . you are going to wait until she is asleep ?
yeah .
i am going to wait here until she comes .
are you sure ?
i will honk four times so you will hear it and know she is on her way up . okay ?
i do not know if you are a detective or a pervert .
that is for me to know and for you to find out . i will see you . i mean call you , okay ?
okay , okay . bye .
well , i have found out some things , nothing really for certain . there are some strange people involved .
what did you see ?
well . maybe we should discuss this somewhere else , you know what i mean ?
he got a little jealous .
i am sorry , i did not . . .
it is okay . do not worry about it .
no way . i am about to blow up .
ok . it is a strange world , sandy . this is what i have found out . what i think i have found out . dorothy vallens is married to a man named don . they have a son . i think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named frank who has now cut off both of dongs ears . i think he is holding them to make her do things for him . i think she wants to die . the ears were for her a warning to stay alive . there is another man involved . i call him the yellow man . you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door . i do not know what he does but i think he is on drugs supplied by frank . frank is a very dangerous man .
wow . should you tell my father ?
i do not see how i can , and i cannot prove any of this . i got all this information illegally . also it could get you in trouble .
you saw a lot in one night .
actually . i have been in twice .
twice . without her sensing anything ?
yes .
did you see her undressed ?
yeah . i mean a little , you know .
yeah ?
that does not bother you , does it ?
who , me ? why should it ?
that is what i thought .
you are sure right . it is a strange world .
why are there people like frank . why is there so much trouble in this world ?
i do not know . i had a dream . in fact , the night i met you . in the dream the world was dark because there were not any robins . you know , birds . robins stood for love , and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love . and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference . i guess , until the robins come there is trouble .
yeah i guess so . you are a neat girl .
so are you . i mean you are a neat guy . we better get back .
i guess so . you want to help me watch frank ? i am going to stake out frank s place tomorrow with a camera .
i will . i will pick you up on the same corner at three thirty five , okay ?
okay , sandy .
you better not , jeffrey .
okay , okay .
goodnight .
see ya tomorrow .
i am really sorry .
what am i going to do ?
you want to go talk to him ?
yeah , but i do not think it is going to do much good . let s go . i will try to talk to him later .
that is what makes it so good . you wanta hear what i saw today ?
shoot .
number one . i saw the yellow man go into frank s building , laughing with frank . now , the only trouble is , what does this prove ?
nothing really , but it is interesting . they know each other . they seem to like each other .
maybe . but i think the yellow man is on drugs . i think frank supplies him .
oh yeah ?
number two . i saw the yellow man come out . this time with a well dressed man with an alligator briefcase . they drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance . number three . now get this . in the distance was a murder . a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken .
jeffrey ! !
then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead mangs place .
i cannot believe what you are finding out . are you going to continue with this . are you going back to her apartment ?
yeah .
jeffrey ? why ?
i am seeing something that was always hidden . i am involved in a mystery . i am learning . and it is all secret .
you like mysteries that much ?
yeah , you are a mystery . i like you . very much .
yes . is that so surprising ? yeah i worry , a lot . i got you into this .
jeffrey , are they important things ? well forget me you have to tell him . jeffrey , i mean it .
okay , but i promise i will not mention you . okay ? i will see him at the police station , okay ? see you friday night , if not before .
yeah . i think so . i just had to tell him some of what i knew . is friday still on ?
you did not tell him about me ?
no .
okay . great !
what is it ?
just some fatherly advice .
nothing , really ! it is good to see you .
it is good to see you .
where to ?
just go over to gelford and up to vista . it is not far . can you tell me any more about what you learned ?
i would rather not talk about it . i will tell you about it sometime .
it is okay .
you look beautiful .
thank you . whatiya say we just enjoy the evening ?
i like that idea , that is a real good idea .
i cannot dance fast .

no .
let s wait for some slow one .
just a minute .
okay .
frank ! ! !
no .
sandy , this guy is a killer ! ! i promise you .

you can change it if you want to .
i do not know why we have to watch tv .
mike . we do not have to watch it . come on .
sure , just a sec . excuse me .
okay .
stop it mike .
you shut up . nobody s talking to you . hey who s that jeffrey ? your mother ?
needed an outsider . the package boy knows everyone . he would spot our hitters a mile away .
just for him ?
well he is the one shooting up all his guys , right ? he is scared of the kid . says he is real good , got every available gun in the city up there .
up where ?
up his house . i do not know that is going on but i know it is gotta have something to do with this kid .
oh fuck !
hey , augustus , i need your help , i got a serious problem here . i am not screwing around .
i bounced you on my knee at family reunions , for christ sakes . your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot nosed little prick . and when you took the wheel , who was beside you ?
do not start with your shit . do not you talk to me . oh , hey uncle gussy , thanks for years of service . here s a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys shit eight hours a day . what am i , a retired bus driver ?
i need il duce .
the duke ? what did you do ?
this kid , this package boy could bring down the whole east coast . if he decides to turn states he could dismantle us . . . totally . but it looks like for now , he is content with just killing us one by one . and even worse the kid is good at it . i mean i had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and did not even know it .
yeah . i was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him , like he was a ghost or something .
your dad and i used him three times over twenty years , only when everything went totally fucked . believe me kid , you do not want this guy unless you are sure you need him . he is . . . a fucking monster .
go find one .
mother mary , full of grace .
what did you do , connor ?
yes mother .
i mean it now . i carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants . ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop , and then ya sucked me dry . my tits are sagging down ta my ankles . i trip over em for christ sakes , now ya listen ta me , no fighten !
aye .
look in the trash around their hands . see if you can find me two bullet casings . s , if my eye serves me right . do not disturb them . mark them as they lay . newman , root through this shit . if this was a sink find me some metal parts . gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something .
i cannot find the second one , sir .
look under the body .
got it .
well , not armed . if they had guns , they would have used them . but dangerous ? oh yeah .
any tips on where these guys may be ?
any word back from the e . r . s ?
what ?
the press is everywhere outside . they are going nuts for these guys . what do you want to do ?
you are not being charged . it is up to you . do you want to talk to them ?
where is your gun ?
chest pocket . shit !
this is a six shooter .
let s do him right here .
certainly illustrates the diversity of the word .
get a hold of yourself , man .
yes .
do not you think that is a little psycho ? a little weird ?
weird , huh ? . . . know what i think is weird ? decent men with loving families go home every day after work . they turn on the news and see rapists , murderers , and child molesters all getting out of prison .
fuck it ! i am doing it . i deserve it . i have been working for those fat bastards since i was in high school and look at this place .
shit . she is on every drug know to man . she would have sold that thing for a dime bag . screw her . but i do kinda feel like an ass hole .
you sound real remorseful .
listen . something s been bothering me about last night .
what ?
well . . . what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there . . . in that room ?
what are you saying ?
think about it man . nine men , six bullets .
you think they sold me out ? no way .
he probably knew you would end up nailing the fat guy , maybe one or two more , but he had to know you were not walking out of there . figure it out . shooter s dead on the scene . no in depth investigation . it would slide right off his back . cause as much as i love ya , you are not exactly don corleone . what would he be losing ? a thirty five year old delivery boy ?
no , no . that is just not the way things are done . besides , how is he know i do not just get in there see there s too many and just serve em their fucking food and beat it ?
he knows you , man . he knows all you want is to move up . that is all . a smooth hitter woulda gone in there , seen it was a wash and slipped out . but a guy like you ? knowing this is your only chance ? waiting eighteen years ?
no . no man . that is . . . that is . . . you do not know what you are talking about . that is bullshit . i know these guys . i mean , thanks for your concern , but that just ai not the thing of it .
do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in .
no , look . no rolling . nothing needs to be rolled .
what happened ?
i killed em ! oh , jesus ! i killed em all ! !
lakeview the deli ? oh , shit !
fuck , man ! i may as well have posted flyers . right out in public , man .
oh , what the fuck ? how do you guys decide who you are . . . i mean , who makes the cut ? is there a raffle or something ?
meee ! me ! i am the guy ! i know everyone , their habits , where they hang out , who they talk to . i know where they fucking live . we could kill everyone !
i i will tip her .
this place is like a scumbag yard sale .
no way . i have been waiting for this asshole .
aw , c mon . i gotta clear my family name here . i have brought shame to the house of della rocco .
forget it . it is a family prayer . my father , his father before him that sort of shit .
c mon !
fuck you ! i told you i never saw him before !
i know what the fuck he looks like !
what ? what , that guy ?
this guy is very sharp . if he has not figured us out yet , he will .
okay , just calm down . he could hurt us , brother . he could ruin the whole thing .
let him go or i will deliver you , right now .
you will not do it connor , you will not . you love me man .
we are here brother .
you gotta keep going .
connor , is that you ?
is that worthless brother of your there ? i want you both ta hear this .

mother , what are you saying ? you are talking crazy here .
what the hell are you doing with da s gun ! ?
i want ta tell ya one last thing before i pull the trigger .
pull the trigger ? ! have ya lost it woman ? ! now just calm down here .
blame . . .
well , you know how it is with him . always complaining he is never turning a profit on st . patty s . whole damn family goes down there with no money , cause we know he cannot bear ta charge us .
what . . . the dirty bitch ! i hope ya trounced her a good one !
well , i did not but . . .
well , there s my boys . shit . i gotta go . looks like i caused a ruckus with that shot . half the damn neighborhood is coming .
come on , ma . out with it . who came out first ?
all right , i suppose you have the right ta know .
we . . . met them last night .
they had some pretty interesting bandages . know anything about that ?
we paid attention in school .
know any other languages ?
our mother can see through bags .
so you are telling me it was one guy with six guns ? a and he was a senior fucking citizen ?
i think it is better if we find this man before he finds us again .
i will see what i can do . how do i get in touch with you ?
we are going to hit poppa joe tonight , right in the comfort of his own home . then we move on to new york . it is getting a bit hot for us here .
be careful .
i will call you tonight , afterwards .
an f . b . i . agent came by the bar . he left me his c c , he left me his c c , he left me this .
we are going to turn ourselves in . it was self defense .
y y yeah that is what he said .
right .
fuck !
me up the . . .
ass !
aye .
aye .
how many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb ?
how many ?
two . one ta screw it in and one ta suck my cock .
shut it . it is ma .
lord have mercy . that was a good one ma .
i gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today .
do not even do it , ya bastard .
he got beat up by a girl .
if that was a girl i want ta see some papers . she had ta be just preoperative for christ sakes .
yeah . it is been twenty seven years .
we just got up and left . bum musta rolled them before the police got there .
okay . we are ready .
do not c cross the road if ya cannot get out of the kitchen .
yeah , it is st . patty s day . everyone s irish tonight . now , why do not ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us ?
i am afraid we cannot let that one go , ivan .
italian .
german . not in our neighborhood , man . a hundred percent irish . no one talks to cops . period .
spanish . then i guess he is just real . . . real good .
no pictures , either .
. . . so that which is good may flourish
for what ?
charlie bronsongs always got rope .
what ?
yeah , these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it .
oh , you have lost it , have not ya ?
i am serious .

i do not know they just always need it .
what is all this they shit ? this ai not a movie .

asshole ! ? i am not the rope toting charlie bronson wanna be that is getting us lost !
sh , sh ! fuck you !
aye .
on tv ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch .
yeah , and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes .
oh , we are good man .
yes , we are .
oh , you are good . what were you gonna do ? laugh the last three to death , funny man ?
little girls catching stray bullets in their heads , playing hopscotch in their front yards . and everyone thinks the same thing . . . someone should just go kill those motherfuckers .
kill em all . admit it , even you have thought about it .
yes .
then what the fuck ?
holy shit . who ? how many ?
i am strangely comfortable with it .
so , when are you getting a plastic fuck doll ?
rocco , this is the real deal . we must kill without hesitation , without guilt or remorse . evil man , dead man .
a fucking men !
and he is one smart man .
he is a good man .
we do not ask for your poor or your hungry .
we do not want your tired and sick .
it is your corrupt we claim .
it is your evil , who will be sought by us .
with every breath we shall hunt them down .
each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies .
do not kill , do not rape , do not steal . these are principles which every man of every faith can embrace .
these are not polite suggestions . they are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost .
there are varying degrees of evil . we urge you lesser forms of filth not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption . . . into our domain .
for if you do , there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three . and on that day you will reap it .
and we will send you to whatever god you wish .
okay then . . . let s get ya started .
rule of thumb ?
yeah ?
do you know where that term comes from ? in the early s it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb .
oh , come on now rozengurtle . i was just trying ta get a rise outta ya .
now look rozengurtle , we are sorry . just relax .
yeah , well . . . i am an expert in name ology .
uh . . . two shooters !
fan fuckin tastic !
that depends . you either do your job or get ethical .
can she i . d . them ?
they were wearing masks .
of course they were . how many ?
three .
nah , too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the copley plaza . besides , if you are a hitter , you are either working for the russians or the italians . there s no riding the fence . our little theory from last night just got blown to shit . something . . . new is going on here .
no . this guy is big time . these two are street walking scum .
that is just fucking weird . i have no idea .
how do you figure ?
friends , gentlemen . they were friends .
rocco !
where is my cat ?
i killed your fucking cat , you druggie bitch !
you . . . oh god , why ?
i felt it would bring closure to our relationship !
you killed my . . . my . . .
my , my . . .
your what , bitch ? i will shoot myself in the head , you can tell me that cats name ! go ahead . . . your what ? your precious little . . .
pee . . . per . . . man .
peeperman ? wrong ? what color was it ? ! ! !
it was . . . it was . . .
male or female , bitch ? ! !
really want to know ?
these guys were pros . i think they were coming for one target , the fag man , he was the . . .
the what man ?
the fat man .
well , freud was right . so you think they came for the fag man , huh ? and what do you base this upon ?
he was the only one done right . two in the back of the head .
and the pennies ?
new hitman wants to leave his mark
that is a possibility . y know you boston cops are perking up . that is two sound theories in one day , neither of which deal with abnormally sized men . another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent .
yeah . some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead , or silver .
the greeks . the italians .
the sicilians .
they shot him at a downward angle . they put him on his knees .
excellent ! number two . greenly .
what about one guy with two guns ?
possible , but unlikely . the angles are too extreme . a guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead . he would not cock out his elbows , makes no sense . besides , you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds ? no way . had to be at least two .
it is gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other .
and is there an american , shit is there a man seated among us that has not thought about it many times , let s just put them all on an island , give them guns and let them kill each other . this is our wet dream come true . you can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law , then bury it from here on out .
no way they could have seen it ?
those doors were down . . . which means this . they looked down in through the peep hole , saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside . pop , pop , pop , right through the glass . why ?
what ?
a guy went nuts over off of commonwealth today . shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight . fled the scene . do not have much on him .
why was i not informed of this ?
crime of passion . he just went nuts . he would have shot everyone in here . he just ran out of bullets .
duffy . this look like a fucking post office to you ? this guy came in here with intent . maybe he did not know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea . the bartender was not a fucking accident .
well , we did not get any help on that . a lot of people saw it . nobody s talking .
fucking figures . look , are you guys seeing the pattern here ? we got big questions at both of these crime scenes , with no answers . why did they kill the guys in the other two booths ? why did he do the bartender ? it would seem unnecessary , even stupid . god , i hate cold crime scenes ! i am fucking leaving now . and do me a favor , tell me when the next guy dies , cause these guys are not done yet .
brilliant . so now we got a huge guy theory and serial crusher theory . top fucking notch . that is your name ?
detective greenly . who the fuck are you ?
twist of lemon !
chief , what the fuck is this ?
sweet n low !
why do you always disrespect me like that ?
respect is earned , greenly , never given . guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table .
eight .
shit ! shit !
it tells us that he was the last to die . all these men were carrying . they came in , dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man . did not they , duffy ? ! they sure as fuck did !
witness ?
no way they could have seen it .
who were the victims ?
a couple of peons for the mob and . . .
oh that is just beautiful ! all the scumbags in the quiet city of boston start dropping dead and you think it is unrelated ? ! greenly , the day i want the boston police doing my thinking for me , i will have a fucking tag on my toe ! now , get me a squad car and get me over there . i want the crime scene photos and any witness statements . now !
why do not you let me do the thinking , huh , genius ?
i got it ta my head now . i got it ta my head now .
i . . .
okay , seriously , both you listen ta me now .
just called ta torture us did ya ?
well you tell him ta take it easy with that . he is gotta learn ta respect women the way connor does .
we promise .
do not kill me . oh shit , please no . i am rocco . i am the funny man ! . . . the funny man . . . the funny .
hallelujah , jaffar .
so you are not just talking mob guys . you are talking anyone , right ? even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit ?
we are like eleven . we ai not always doing business , but we are always open .
who says that ? you could take credit on it .
what are you serious ?
yeah , fuck it . if you think about it , it is all you can do really . you cannot tell him it was us . go in bragging and shit .
oh , jesus . you are such a fucking retard !
fuck you !
use your brain for once . is it so unbelievable they do not care about you ? you are fucking dead , you go in there today . dead !
oh yeah . you two fucking micks know that is going on , huh ? fuck you !
i will be back at .
hey murph .
roc . you okay ?
yeah . anybody call for me ?
no . you sure you are okay ?
i am fucking fine . catch you on the flip side .
hey , murph .
roc . you okay ?
yeah . anybody call for me ?
no . you sure you are okay ?
i am fucking fine . catch you on the flip side .
this is some crazy shit , man !
those cocksuckers sold me out !
you sure you killed them ?
y know it is , a bit .
so ?
so let s kill the motherfucker . i mean , what are you guys . . . like that is your new thing right ?
well , what ya do ?
fine ! fuck it ! when we are done she can i . d . me . i do not care . just trying to be professional , but no . . .
well , i am sold .
fuck you both ! ya ask me , he was aiming at you !
what the fuck do you mean ?
i mean he ai not here .
well , i would say that makes him a lia fuckin bility .
we have to go now . we are on the lamb .
you will make it outta here . you cannot ever stop , not ever .
y yes my son .
why have i come to a church ? i never have before . i guess i just . . . felt i should .
what is it my son ?
it is ethics . i put evil men behind bars , but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these . . . cocksuckers to slip through . i have found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist . as if they have god s permission . but what they do is wrong and i should arrest them . . . technically .
god s permission ? god does not . . .
you believe ?
yes .
you feel ?
yes .
you feel ? a soul is what gives you feelings . happiness , guilt , right or wrong . it is a conduit through which the lord speaks to us . you felt that your answers would be here in the house of god today . you feel these men are necessary . the lord has spoken to you twice this day .
you have entered the house of the lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings . is it so much to believe that god has brought you here ?
i guess not .
it is easy to be sarcastic about religion . it is harder to take small hints from god , your feelings and listen to them . . . to take a stand .
those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision .
i want to stand for what i believe in , father .
then you must find out what your beliefs are .
i believe these young men are right .
you know them personally ?
yes .
do you think they would harm an innocent man , for any reason ?
no . they would never do that .
yes ! yes ! i was thinking that , too . no . i was feeling it . all i needed was to hear you say it ! amen ! i will help them .
forgive me father .
thank you , father , thank you . whatever . goodbye , amen .
yes .
i am sorry you are gonna hafta see this . do not look at me !
i am sorry , i am sorry . i did not see .
shut up ! shut the fuck up !
open it !
have you no fear of god ?
that is who i am doing this for , now open the fucking thing .
god have mercy on my soul .
what do you want me to say ?
just be natural , goddamit .
how long since your last confession , my son ?
just go !
yeah . thanks , rocco . see ya .
yeah boss ?
the . . . the funny man .
the funny man . well , i got a new job for you , just for now . roc , i am having a real shitty day . i am depressed . tell me a funny story or a joke .
uh . okay . . . um . . . you hear the one about the , no fuck that one . . . uh . . . oh ! oh ! well . . . shit . okay , there s a white guy . he is walking along the beach and he finds a , a pot , y know and ah , he rubs it and this genie pops out . but this genie , he is a ni . . . he is a black guy .
he is a nigger .
yeah . and uh , he is pissed off . he says , why you crackers always gotta find my mother fucking pot ? and he tells him he is gonna grant all his three wishes but he is gonna give all the black guys . . .
he says , that is your third wish ? and the guys says , i i want you to beat me half to death .
joey bevo said it was important . said i had to give it to him myself .
gimme the fucking thing . now sit the fuck down !
fuck you vincenzo .
tell me a joke funny man . hee hee .
i caught your show down at the velvet room at the holiday inn , loved it when you busted into viva las vegas .
black hair . paul michael glaser .
making hutch david soul ?
right . the blond guy .
ok . that is wrong .
dignan , it is
plus where is huggie bear ?
he is not there . huggie bear is not in every single episode .
i think you might of dreamed this one , anthony .
no . it is a real episode . the killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones .
as part of his plan . i do not know why .
see , that is what i am saying . it has the logic of a dream .
the point is the killer always goes , may i speak to starsky ? he says his name .
what does starsky say ?
he says . this is he .
this is he ?
no . this is he .
kind of . except we have already got the keys .
that is true . but what if they change the locks ?
would they do that ?
who knows ? that is why i filed it down .
see , your mind is very good with the more mechanical details . whereas my strength would be
she is an attractive older woman .
what do you think the cops have ?
but dignan , do you really know that much about rare coins ?
i know about money , anthony . i know the value of money . plus the earrings are worth three times that .
every valuable item in the house was on that list .
that does not make any difference . i bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday . they have a very special value for her .
yeah , but i cannot be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary . there s just not time for it .
then you should not of gone in there , dignan . maybe we should of robbed your house . did you ever think of that ?
i do not appreciate you ridiculing me .
how was i ridiculing you ?
you are making fun of my family . you know there s nothing to steal from my mom and craig . you know exactly what you are saying .
that is not what i meant , dignan .
yeah , i saw it .
i am lookout .
dignan , it is got an alarm .
i do not think so . just reach on in .
that sets it off .
no , just do it real quick . i will meet you down there .
yeah , i heard that .
five , seven , eight dollars .
eight dollars .
that is not bad .
hang on a second .
yeah .
just turn right here .
you think we are going to be chased ?
that is a good question . no . i do not . i am just being hypocritical here . however , i will say
nothing . go ahead .
no , dignan . it is not your gun . it is all of ours .
you are out ! i am not working with either one of you !
dignan ! stop !
you are right . you are right .
where is the other stocker ?
there s another stocker , right ?
we know there s another stocker .
unlock that door . check the aisles .
we got it . we got it .
oh , shit . that was scary . in the middle of the robbery . the manager looks at me . right in the eye . and goes , i am going to remember you .
like he meant it .
yeah .
like he would find dignan . one day .
like i am going to hunt you down and kill you .
what do you think ?
anthony , he sat in the car and watched a in progress . he got what he deserved .
he was the driver , dignan . he did what he is supposed to do .
i did not realize you were so sensitive to bob s feelings . considering i did the plans , you are actually lucky you got
do not even say it , man .
i do not like to use that credit card , dignan .
why not ?
because my mom gets the bill .
she is not going to notice , anthony .
i do not want to use it .
well , then cut it in half .
i keep it for emergencies .
anthony , we are on the run . this is an emergency . it is only fair that . . .
dignan , those are not running shoes .
yes , they are .
look at the treads on those .
what about them ?
they obviously were not designed for racing .
well , those treads stink . you would blow a knee out racing on those .
you have never had a pair of fast shoes in your life , dignan . in fifth grade dignan used to wear cowboy boots for p . e .
that is real cool , anthony . yeah , i wore boots . my parents would not buy me any running shoes like yours . i was not spoiled .
do not call me spoiled , dignan .
you were spoiled rotten .
i will say it .
ok . go ahead .
on your marks . . . get set go .
bob ?
no , i am not saying her . i am just saying , i do not know .
it is a great shirt . do not worry about it .
i know . but once you get inside you are home free .
right . get back to me on that one . once your plan is worth a shit .
it is not a plan . it is just
actually . if you knew the exact route , you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over .
yeah , but you would not have the truck if you blew it up .
true .
then you are going to have to dye it , anthony . we have got to hide our identities . especially after bob crashed the car .
even if it is the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not ?
no . we did not .
hi .
inez , this is
jerry . and this is my associate cornelius .
sure .
what . that is the matter ?
anthony , we are on the run from the law here . did you tell these people your real name ?
no . i did not . dignan , they do not speak english .
they do not ?
no . not really . inez speaks a little .
which one was that ?
on the left .
no kidding .
no , no . look . ok . let s stay here until we find out that is going on .
as long as he gets out ok .
obviously . that is a given .
bob ?
do not worry about it , bob .
this was in fourth grade .
mr . langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation . cpr . i have never said this before , but frankly i thought anthony was dead . the veins in his face were all sticking out . his skin was blue . he truly did look dead .
after that my parents never let me go to dignangs again .
they blamed my family for everything . they always said mr . langston saved anthony s life .
yes . . . it is true .
where was it parked ?
right here .
maybe he just went to the store .
he took his stuff . he is gone . i should of seen this . i should of expected it . bob does not have any character .
we said hours .
that is a long time to be in jail .
this morning .
where was i ?
you were asleep .
he told you and you let him do it .
he told me because he wanted to know if i wanted to go .
if you wanted to go ? what were you going to do ? just leave me here by myself ?
well , i did not do it , did i ?
so when you were saying bob s at the store and acting real surprised , that was just an act . you were just
bob went to help his brother . i understand that and i cannot help it if you do not .
i understand that if i had a few more friends like you and bob i would be dead .
if you say so .
i did not realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself , dignan .
well , the world is a little bit colder today .
no . i am going to swim . i will see you later .
ok .
can you hand me those french fries .
would of been nice .
i do not really feel like talking about it . the only thing i feel like is getting the fuck out of this place .
we need a car .
what ?
inez has a master key to all these rooms , does not she ? does not she ?
i do not think we can do that .
i know we can . it is real simple . we go into a room , grab some car keys and
what i am saying is she would not go for that .
she does not need to know .
i do not know , dignan . i just
look . i am ready to get the fuck out of here . it is real torture for me to be here . getting the shit kicked out of me by mexicans .
shh .
no one to back me up . now i have a good idea . so unless you come up with something better
dignan . i cannot do that . all right ? i just cannot .
you do not know how to hotwire .
yes , i do . bob taught me .
bob taught you how to get electrocuted .
no , i am serious . he made me a diagram .
do not panic , anthony .
i am not . but there s
you cannot just run home every time things get tough . first of all , we have got enough dough to
our money situation is not good .
you are so spoiled . what is not good to you ? only a few hundred
we have got sixteen dollars .
that is not correct .
i know .
where is the rest ?
how much ?
.
she needed it .
a tip ! for the housekeeper !
her name s inez . stop calling her the housekeeper .
that is what she is !
i know that . but
you are in love with the fucking housekeeper !
shut up !
what are you going to do , get married ? have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats ! and go around scrubbing the
ah . couple days ago .
that is applejack . you want to meet him ?
sure .
you really hit a guy with a bottle ?
what is it ?
it is big , anthony . real big . it is called hinckley cold storage .
that is hinckley cold storage ?
who s mr . henry ?
you will meet him this afternoon . he is helping us set it up .
right . freezers . imported foods .
right now .
let me feel that .
he seems pretty good .
bob !
get out of the way .
no , dignan . this is not
easy , dignan . it is ok .
what the fuck are we doing out here ?
i do not know , dignan . you went crazy .
i am sorry , bob .
eleven fifteen .
ok . mark that down .
i did .
yeah . it is pretty good .
it is like we have finally arrived .
hopefully this trip will go a little smoother than the last one .
did that hurt ?
i do not think you will .
i do not want to be too much of a liability .
look , you are going to do fine . it is ok to be scared .
i do not think i ever said this to you . but it meant a lot to me the way you were after that swifty stuff happened .
he was all right .
as a person ?
yeah . as a girl .
yes . i do .
so do i .
go ahead , bird dog .
you are all clear .
roger .
we all set ?
hang on a second .
take your second position .
ok . roger .
any activity ?
not at all . the place is totally deserted .
good . it is supposed to be .
i have got a great view up here . i can see all the
stand by , bird dog .
check the fucking elevator . it is moving .
it was bob . his walkie talkie s busted .
it is going back down .
applejack ! that is happening ?
nobody move !
get against the wall !
careful . check his pulse .
it is the fire alarm . somebody pulled the fire alarm .
where is kumar ?
i do not know .
jesus christ , anthony . did you lose him ?
let s go . come on .
come on , kumar .
applejack s stuck in the elevator ?
i will see you there .
what ?
i will see you there .
what are you talking about ?
i will get him .
there s not enough time .
yes , there is . let s get organized .
i do not think so .
cannot remember shit . crs .
i do not think so . i mean . actually , he robbed bob s house .
he did ?
yeah .
you got to be kidding me .
i am not kidding .
what would he get ?
pretty much everything .
the grandfather clock ?
we have not heard from applejack since he got out of the hospital . his case got dismissed .
we are not sure .
what do you mean ?
nothing .
it belongs to bob s uncle .
how big is it ?
oh , i would say about
behind bob s house .
we are not sure yet . it is going to need some repairs .
what can i say ? it is jail . you do not sleep when you want to . you do not eat when you want to .
he stole a tractor .
you are kidding .
no . i am not .
how ?
shhh . wait for my instructions .
dignan , i
what ?
have the car running at the north west checkpoint . bob and i will
dignan , i
scale the
shield me from the bullets . they will not shoot civilians . ready ?
nice to meet you .
that is a sharp jacket .
thanks .
it is called a racquet , anthony , and you are holding it wrong . that is ghetto play . hold it like this .
thanks .
grammar .
technique . that is right . seventy five percent of your job is crowd control . seventy five percent . do you believe that ?
yeah . convert it into lofts . ok . pop quiz . that is the single most important aspect of your job ?
yeah . and i will tell you who we are going to want kumar banijamali .
so do i .
i am not really sure . i think it is irish . or maybe
i guess what i am trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this dignan ?
what do you mean what kind of person ? he is a good person .
sure , sure . he is a great person , and i would call bullshit on anybody who said differently . but i wonder if the kid has the goods up here .
i do not think you are giving him enough credit . i know sometimes he does not think an idea through . he gets too excited . but
as far as i can tell he has not thought his life through . he would be fine cutting my grass or parking my car . but business ? you i can work with . you i could groom . dignangs not going to make it .
hold it .
what do you mean ?
the abe henry double cross test . you just made a perfect score .
take a deep breath .
it feels good .
yes , he did .
how would he do ?
that sounds like dignan .
me ?
no , that door over there .
i do not want to die .
are you afraid ?
yeah . i mean , i do not think about it all the time . but once in awhile i kind of go , woah . man .
exactly . woah .
death .
the fear of death , the pain of consciousness . did you mix this martini ?
no . bob did .
bob . bob . that is a palindrome . i love palindromes .
are you afraid to die , mr . henry ?
anthony , i am petrified .
i want to ask a favor , boys . one day , when i am long gone and all but forgotten , make one last toast to abe henry . and remember me as a friend .
yeah .
it is an esoteric journey .
can i ask you something , mr . henry ?
absolutely .
why would you want to help us ?
because i was like you once . and there was no one there to help me .
who ?
future man . you know . cause he looks like he is from the future .
yeah . i have stolen two cars before . one jaguar . and one trans am . with t tops . that trans am was fun to drive .
pot is an herb . it is just like any type of gardening .
it is private property . plus i have hector .
hector woud not do anything .
but he is got a loud bark . that is the most important thing is a loud bark .
i do not know . sure , i guess .
you could make your own cinnamon toast .
let them fight .
yeah . he said that .
see you , bob .
what was that ?
there s a million places to hide around here .
oh , yeah . they will never catch the guy .
i hope not .
phil probably provoked him . where is he going ?
move .
i do not know . i personally do not need that shit in my life right now .
nobody does .
ok , dad .
he looked too shaken up .
i do not know . i do not know anything . except phil says they got him . and he is in jail .
and if future man does not get let out of jail in hours , then we go back . all right ?
is that ok ?
i am not playing any more golf .
why not ?
cause i am not getting any better . it is a waste of time .
you have only been playing for two weeks , bob . it takes a long time to learn this game .
you think i am improving ?
yes . you just got to stick with it .
no , i do not mind .
i know it must of been a bad experience . but it does not sound like it was your fault .
well , i did not mean to electrocute him . but the whole operation was my idea .
that is pretty complicated for a senior prank .
i do not like that word prank , bob . i was trying to do something more than a prank .
sixty days ?
yeah . one minute you are studying great expectations and the next minute you are drawing the holy mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend .
why were you drawing the holy mary ?
prison tatoos . i got to be pretty good . it is not like drawing on paper .
yeah , but he still has the aggravation . three days sitting in a cell .
were you adopted , bob ?
why do you say that ?
well , because you guys do not look alike .
no . i was not adopted .
jesus christ ! no .
it was stupid .
cause you would of let my brother rot in jail .
hopscotch . the code name is hopscotch .
no , i am having a heart attack . of course , i am ok . that is that supposed to mean ?
nothing . i was just asking .
sure .
my walkie talkie s busted . i cannot tell that is going on .
let me see it . did you drop it ?
no .
i did not do anything .
who s got the car keys ?
his health is not very good , you know . they take that into account .
temporarily .
dies y nueve .
right . yeah . yo soy dies y nueve . how old are you ?
no .
it could happen . this is the exact kind of place where it happens . but i do not want to scare you .
cuba .
oh , really ? that is interesting . do you prefer cuba or the united states ?
god , yes . like silk .
like silk ?
god . that does sound corny . oh , your skin feels so soft and silky . but it really kind of does .
you are anthony ?
yeah .
i hear you are a good thief .
uh uh .
s . cooper trust , in san francisco ?
uh uh .
abdul shabazz ?
what do you mean ?
feel this .
the front stairs .
where were you ?
why the fuck do we need to blow up the car ? it does not make any goddamn sense .
just settling an old score . you might say revenge .
that sounds like a lot of bullshit that will land us in jail .
we might have to take that chance . cause i feel pretty strongly about this .
is that buckethead ?
wait a second .
that is your friend anthony ?
yeah .
that is he doing here ?
looks like he is staying with buckethead . that is what i figured . he is probably got his own room . let s see where he is going .
we are going too slow . it looks like we are following him .
hell , no . this is a . i was driving a pontiac .
well , this is not really a party per se .
you do not celebrate til it is over .
true .
bob ! get back in position !
you are the faggot .
i do not know about that .
little richard . trust me . you are insane . jesus , this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk . you do not want a guy like that loose on the streets .
it seemed like a good idea at the time .
the one and only little richard .
i do not know , bob . what about one of those ?
not even for emergencies ?
no .
i thought your parents were in italy .
they are .
so who s going to know ?
my brother .
that never would of
let s cut the bullshit .
what are you talking about , bob ?
can you use a coaster .
yes . i did .
ok , bob .
it is true , dignan .
well . what do you want to do ? you want to steal one or just drive your car ?
i will just drive my car .
as much as i want . when these plants bud i will probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed .
six thousand dollars ? come on , bob .
you should take a look . i have an entire crop in my backyard .
good question .
you are paranoid , bob .
yeah , but do not tell anybody .
i cannot believe you said that .
what did i say ?
i told you he is crazy .
i warned you , dignan .
you said it like it was a big joke , bob . like he is wild .
no , i was saying crazy like a lunatic .
i know that now . he is a fucking psycho .
well , do not blame me . i told you .
i do blame you , bob . and woah . look at her .
maybe she turned .
let s just go .
hang on . this is important , bob . anthony and i are responsible for the internal situation . the money and the people . you are responsible for the external situation . the streets and the getaway .
that is my responsibility .
that is your domain .
ok .
i am paying attention . i just want to look at it for a minute .
that is your fucking problem ? you are a shithead !
i just want to see how much bullets it takes .
god dammit .
well , in reality it is not that dangerous , bob . it is only dangerous if you do not know what you are doing .
yeah , but what if some nut pulled gun on you ?
he electrocuted someone ?
it was an accidental . i do not want to go into the details . it was just one of those senior pranks that did not really go right . i mean , obviously , since swifty s dead . that is why anthony never graduated .
his name was swifty ?
yeah . one of the nicest old guys you would ever know .
that is too bad .
you know , when somebody gets electrocuted , their skin starts smoking . at least swifty s did .
i am putting a piece of tape on my nose .
shhh . slow down , bob . drive natural .
this is natural .
that is good . keep it at forty .
did we get it ?
be cool , bob . be cool . make that light .
do not count it .
no . i was calm .
no . all he will remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose .
i do not want to talk about it .
that is true . that would give me nightmares .
bob , i have got nightmares .
i told you they were there .
so it is my fault ?
there were more than that .
he would not move .
i do not know .
it is registered in my mother s name .
what the fuck possessed you ?
you are the one who kept saying ram him .
see you in a little while .
my brother s in jail .
what are you talking about ?
but it is not his . how can they arrest future man ?
they said he is a drug dealer .
well , the marijuana crop is a good start .
that could be anybody s .
they also found my two beam scale in the garage .
since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house ? everybody has a scale .
the cops say it is a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana .
so tell them the truth . what do you use it for ?
i was just going to use it to see how much i had .
i do not know .
then how come they have not set the bail yet ? that is unconstitutional .
we will have to see when we get back .
well , obviously , we got to go back .
bob , that makes no sense .
dignan , he is my brother . i cannot just leave him there .
this could be a trap .
come on , dignan .
do not come on , dignan me .
i am going back .
not in that car you are not .
watch me .
good luck , since i got the keys .
i cannot do that , bob .
dignan . you are going to give me those keys or you are going to get hurt .
do not threaten me , bob .
goddammit , dignan ! it is my car ! if you do not give me my keys , i swear to god
his name s not future man , dignan .
i know it is not .
you do not even know his name .
yes , i do .
what is it ?
just get in the car , bob .
that is his name ?
ok , bob . i do not know his name . you know why ? because i do not care . he is future man . but i care about you . and to me it does not make sense to go back to the scene of a crime . will you get in the car , bob ? this is stupid .
that is right . i only have one vote . we will go talk with anthony and figure it out .
let s go .
anthony . bad news .
not bad .
come on in . what you been up to ?
not a whole lot , bob .
yeah . it is .
i do not expect an apology and i do not even want one . i just want us to
i cannot fucking believe this guy . an apology , bob ?
man , i do not want to go into this .
i never agreed to that .
bob , you are lying !
bullshit .
all right ! backyard ! right now !
i do not want to fight you , dignan .
i did not have any choice .
that is ok .
look . we want you on the job .
i know it , man . hang on .
jesus christ .
yeah ?
yeah . we are in the elevator . how is it look back there ?
it looks pretty good . there s nobody back here .
stand by . bird dog ?
who s watching the door ? what the fuck are you doing ? get back in position .
he is having a heart attack or something .
let s go !
i think so .
i did not think there was an alarm .
take him to the car , bob .
where is applejack ?
he is stuck between two floors .
run . run . let s go .
that is that ?
that is just what the da asked . crs is a disease where you cannot remember shit .
we do not have rooms , bob . we have cells .
do you have your own cell ?
no . i have a cellmate . his name s carl .
i do not really want to talk about it , bob .
here we go .
wait a second
now !
i am working on it .
hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting .
yeah . hey , clay .
john , i am twenty six years old i did not run away from home .
i know , bob . you were on a secret mission .
i would appreciate it if you did not go around telling people lies about me .
right . i am sorry . you have got a reputation to think about .
hey , jackson . how is it going ?
i am trying .
this boy s a troublemaker . he used to tear this place apart .
he said what ?
he said you ran away from home .
no . i did not run away . i went out of town .
weeks .
and what does that cover ?
social issues . crime prevention .
hand to hand combat ?
did you hear that ?
this is anthony adams , mr . henry .
this is no good .
i do not know . are you in , anthony ?
the basic grammatical rules of robbing .
crowd control . crowd control . wake up , guys .
oh , yeah .
you are going to need a boxman for this one . but that can be arranged .
he is damn good .
we are just going over a few things .
yes .
why ?
well , i think
no , if i go out on this job , then it is just another score by mr . henry . and i do not see it like that . this is your job . your creation . i want you to try this .
who ? applejack ?
why did he go that way ?
he is going to watch the back stairwell , remember ? do not worry about it .
cannot get it . it will not . . .
what can we do ?
where is that guy going ?
he left his sweater .
well , i left some money in there .
where ?
in the cash register . step away from the door .
i do not know . maybe in literature . that is his section .
you got that ?
no . i just have short hair .
is that your chiquita ?
no , my friend knows her .
she chicano , yes ?
sure .
got a little lucky .
where is your friend ? he go with the chiquita ?
she is a good looking woman .
si . tecate . you like to fight ?

mr . henry ?

it is locked .
no , it is not .
good to know you , john .
what ?
the world needs dreamers . to relieve the pain of consciousness .
pleasure to meet you , john .
nice to meet you .
there was a mistake .
i will say . you killed his goddam girlfriend instead . now they are onto neski . they are at the brecker hotel even as we speak .
will it track back to us ?
no . the files are spotless . whatever they find , it is just going to make conklin look worse .
and the landy woman ?
she is done everything i wanted . she bit on conklin so fast it was laughable . she even found his bogus swiss account . . .
anything else ?
one last push . one .
what do you mean ?
go to the airport . get a plane . i will have a brass band waiting for you .
save it for bourne .
what ?
bourne comes here ? why ?
never heard of it .
that is not gonna fly .
with all due respect , pam , i think you might have wandered a little past your pay grade .
i want to know about treadstone .
to know about it ? it was a kill squad . black on black . closed down two years ago . nobody wants to know about treadstone . not around here . you better take this back to marty and make sure he knows what you are doing .
he does . i have been down to the archives . i have the files , ward .
what are you after , pam ? you want to fry me ? you want my desk ? is that it ?
i want to know what happened .
what happened ? jason bourne happened . you have got the files ? then let s cut the crap . it went wrong . conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap . bourne was his number one guy went out to work , screwed the op and never came back . conklin could not fix it , could not find bourne , could not adjust . it all went sideways . finally there were no options left .
so you had conklin killed . i mean , if we are cutting the crap . . .
i have given thirty years and two marriages to this agency . i have shoveled shit on four continents . i am due to retire next year and believe me , i need my pension , but if you think i am gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this , you can go to hell . marshall too . it had to be done .
and bourne ? where is he now ?
dead in a ditch ? drunk in a bar in mogadishu ? who knows ?
i think i do . we had a deal going down in berlin last week . during the buy , both our field agent and the seller were killed . we pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that did not go off . they were killed by jason bourne .
. . . this is conklings computer .
. . . at the time of his death , conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven hundred and sixty thousand dollars .
do you know what his budget was ?
excuse me .
we were throwing money at him . throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark .
may i finish ?
conklin might have been a nut , but he was not a mole . you have me his calendar for a couple of days , i will prove he killed lincoln . this is supposed to be definitive ?
that is definitive , is that i just lost two people in berlin !
so that is your theory ? conklings reaching out from the grave to protect his good name ? the man is dead .
i have already got a team there . i doubt bourne s in naples to settle down and raise a family .
you do not know what you are getting into here .
and you do ? from the moment he left treadstone , he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him . . .
hold on he said he wants to come in .
my ass he does . you are playing with fire , pamela . marshall said nail him to the wall . i do not know how you interpreted that , but i do not think he meant repatriate him .
do not you want answers ?
there are no answers . there s either jason bourne alive or jason bourne dead . and i for one would prefer the latter . and what about her ? you just send her out to this lunatic with no protection ?
it is hard to swallow . the confusion the amnesia but he keeps on killing ? it is more calculated than sick . what about nicky ? she is the last one to see bourne in paris . she is the one he asks for . they disappear . . .
well , whatever he is doing , i have had enough this is now a search and destroy mission . i want the berlin police fully briefed and get this out to all the agencies .
i was not sleeping . you ok ?
they found danny zorngs body . dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time .
oh , god . . . it must have been bourne .
did he say anything to you ?
no . . . it must have been bourne .
do not know .
jesus . . . i , zorn . . . i have to call his family . tell them . . .
i am sorry , ward .
i would rather stand if it is all the same to you .
i do not exactly know what to say i am sorry .
why would be enough for me .
i am not a traitor . i have served my ountry .
and pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it .
why not ? it was just money .
and danny zorn , what was that ?
had to be done .
no good options left ?
in the end , honestly , it is hubris . simple hubris . you reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are .
no . you lost your way .
well , you are probably right . i guess that is all that hubris is .
thanks .
the sooner the better .
what do you have , danny ?
you put a four gam kel on here and it is gonna take out power to the building . you know that . what you cannot know , is if it is gonna blow the room with it .
and ?
there were two charges , they were supposed to go off simultaneously . the second one , the one that did not go off , was down here . . . first of all , this is nothing , it is a sub line for the breaker above . second , why put the charge all the way down here ? if you are good enough to get in here and handle the gear , you are good enough to know you do not need this . bourne would know .
it was staged ?
is it a slam dunk ? no , but . . .
jesus . . .
okay . what if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming conklin and bourne . what if bourne did not have anything to do with this ?
keep going . . .
something s been going on here in europe . and it is still going on . post conklin . who s been in berlin ?
lots of people . . .
including landy . . . she had access to the archives .
nobody . you . i had to tell you , right ?
show me again . . .
okay . . .
i speak english .
okay .
it is nothing . it is just a picture .
no . it is because you do not know how they died .
no , i do .
what ?
yes . . .
that is not what happened to your parents .
then what ?
i killed them .
you killed them .
how . . . how can . . . how can you be here and say this ?
i do not want you to forgive me .
you are a liar .
you know i am not .
you are a liar !
look at me .
i cannot let you do that either .
because you are afraid !
no . because you do not want to know how it feels .
is this really happening ?
i am sorry .
felt a little light .
drop it .
sorry . old habits .
i like it here . last time i saw you was greece . you had a good spot .
she would not let me . she is the only reason you are alive .
conklin .
he is dead .
shot dead in paris . dead the night you walked out .
i do not know .
who sent you to greece ?
a voice . a voice from the states . someone new .
pamela landy ?
i do not know who that is .
that is going on in berlin ?
i do not know ! why would i lie ?
i did .
i am sorry .
how long ? how long do i have
my coat but we should
what ?
take the back get another car
conklin up front .
i will get the book .
no . there s nothing new .
you are sure ? we should still we should write it down .
two years we are scribbling in a notebook
it has not been two years
it is always bad and it is never anything but bits and pieces anyway ! you ever think that maybe it is just making it worse ? you do not wonder that ?
i do remember something good . all the time . i remember you .
i worry when you get like this .
it is just a nightmare .
i do not mean that . i worry when you try to ignore it .
i should be better by now .
you are better . and i think it is not memories at all . it is just a dream you keep having over and over .
but it ends up the same .
one day it will be different . it just takes time . we will make new memories . you and me .
the telegraph office .
but we were so careful .
we pushed it . we got lazy .
he was at the campground yesterday .
so . . .
it is wrong . guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent ?
no . not this . this is real . and he is right there . . .
where
back there at the corner hyundai silver
we cannot wait to be sure .
i do not want to move again . . . i like it here .
look , we clear out , we get to the shack , we get safe . we hang there awhile . i will come back . i will check it out . but right now we cannot
where is left to go ?
there s places we cannot afford to be wrong !
what ?
switch ! you drive !
where ?
make the left toward the bridge
not yet
it is just him ?
yeah one guy i do not think he was ready
hang on
where are you going ?
i am going to bail on the other side and wait . this bridge is the only way he can follow .
what if it is not who you think it is ?
if he crosses the bridge , it is .
there must be another way !
i warned them , marie . i told them to leave us alone .
jason , please do not do this . . . it will not ever be over like this .
there s no choice .
tell me later .
but you found another choice .
i did .
it would not have changed the way you feel .
it might have .
you do ?
i only dream about people who are dead .
jason . you know exactly what to do . that is your mission now .
yes .
get on it .
who is pamela landy ?
you hear me ? i believed you .
is she running treadstone ?
they know ! they know you were here . they know you killed these two guys . they know you and conklin had something on the side . they do not know what it is , but they know !
what is this , a game ?
i want to hear it from you .
last week an agency field officer went to make a buy from a russian national .
a russian ?
it was pamela landy s op . the guy was going to sell out a mole or something . i have not been debriefed on exactly what it was .
last week ? when ?
i killed him ? ? ?
you left a print ! there was kel that did not go off ! there was a partial print , they tracked it back to treadstone ! they know it is you !
i left a fingerprint ! you fucking people .
conklin ! stuff on conklin !
please i am only here because of paris because they cannot figure out what you are doing i am here because of abbott
abbott ?
he closed down treadstone he took care of me after paris . . .
so when was i here ?
what do you mean ?
for treadstone . in berlin . you know my file . i did a job here . when ?
no . you never worked berlin .
my first job .
your first assignment was geneva .
that is a lie !
you never worked berlin . . .
i was here !
. . . it is not in the file . . . i swear . . . i know your file . . . your first job was geneva ! . . . i swear to god you never worked here ! . . .
bourne ?
i want to come in .
i want someone i know to take me in .
who ?
there was a girl in paris . part of the program . she used to handle the medication .
alexanderplatz . minutes . under the world clock . alone . give her your phone .
ramstein air base , germany . before the wall fell you would have woken up in a russian prison hospital .
careful . . .
are you disappointed ?
that is that ?
do you think you can read ? are you well enough ?
sounds like a threat .
you did not answer my question .
why you are alive ? you are alive because you are special . because she kept you alive . because we want you back on our side .
i am working on it .
and the germans cannot match it ?
who s going ? us ?
there s only a consulate , they sent a field officer out half an hour ago
then get a number , they need to know who they are dealing with .
uplink all relevant files to kim and i want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with treadstone
the hotel how far ?
i want to look at the room . check it out .
what ?
this stays between you and i . we finally have an edge . i do not want to lose it .
but we can relax . we tracked him . he is on a train to moscow .
what ? the tapes ?
hold on . . . yep . and abbott just direct dialed moscow from his room . . .
here ?
now . show now .
is there . is all there .
no ! not me ! no other people !
shut up ! just shut the
that is where we came out .
it is a lot of money , pam .
we are talking raw , unprocessed kgb files . it is not something we can go out and comparison shop .
still . . .
for a thief . a mole . i vetted the source , marty . he is real . if it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects , it is a bargain at ten times the price .
i think that bourne and conklin were in business . that bourne is still involved . and that whatever information i was going to buy in berlin , it was big enough to make bourne come out from wherever he is been hiding to kill again . how is that scan ?
who s this ?
pamela landy , again . where do we stand ?
me ? four years .
if you ever want to make it to five , you are gonna listen to me real close . jason bourne is armed and extremely dangerous . a week ago , he assassinated two men in berlin , one of whom was a highly experienced field officer . . .
yes , sir ma am . . .
i am getting on a plane to berlin in minutes , which means you are going to call me back in , and when i ask you where we stand , i had better be impressed . my mobile number is . . .
depression . anger . compulsive behaviors . they had physical symptoms headaches sensitivity to light
amnesia ?
before this ? before bourne ? no .
you were his local contact . you were with him the night conklin died . you are coming with us .
am i a doctor , no , but . . .
are you an expert in amnesia ?
look , what do you want me to say ? i was there . i believed him .
believed what ?
i believed jason bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown .
so he fooled you .
if you say so .
not good enough . you are the person who floated this amnesia story . ever feel sorry for him ? for what he would been through ?
you are making it out like we are friends here or something . i met him alone twice .
you felt nothing ? no spark ? two young people in paris ? dangerous missions ? life and death ?
you mean , did i want a date ?
did you ?
these were killers . conklin had them all jacked up . they were dobermans .
some women like dobermans
what do you want from me ? i was reassigned . i am out .
see , that is a problem for me , nicky . whatever he is doing , we need to end it . this is not the kind of mess you walk away from .
and why is that ?
because he is doing just what he said he would do . he is coming for us .
it is got caffeine in it . that is all i know .
i do not know . he was sick . he wanted out . i believed him .
alright . . .
so ?
felt promising . it is a start .
yup . . . the main word there , the file heading , translates as treadstone .
what the hell is a treadstone ?
no . munich s a bust . he is loose .
are we locked up ?
yeah , that will work . . . what the hell was he doing here ?
by who ?
his wife . in room . then she shot herself .
alright . . . i want you , kurt and kim to stay on bourne , track everything that is out there . . .
are we hacking or asking ?
yes . in that order .
and what about you , anything ?
we just had a funeral , is not that what it means in england as well ?
what it means in england and in scotland too is that rebels have forfeited their lands . we were ambushed last night . but the scots dragged their dead away .
my brother and nephew perished two days ago , when their hay cart turned over .
then we will just have a peek at the wounds . dig em up !
they have been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of god s church , and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation . so please do it .
i do not want to leave .
did not want your father to die either , did ya ? but it happened .
it was in latin , sir .
non loquis latinum ? you do not speak latin ? we have to fix that , will not we ? did he give the poetic benediction ? the lord bless thee and keep thee ? patris benefactum et . . . it was malcolm s favorite .
saying goodbye in their own way in outlawed tartans , with outlawed pipes , playing outlawed tunes .
i will invade england . and defeat the english on their own ground .
invade ? ! that is impossible , it
we must sue for peace .
peace ? !
we cannot defeat this
with cavalry not heavy , like the english , but light , fast horsemen , like you nobles employ we could outmaneuver their bowmen !
it is suicide .
you have all sworn to longshanks .
an oath to a liar is no oath at all . an oath to a patriot is a vow indeed . every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you .
so let the council swear publicly .
we cannot . some scarcely believe you are alive . other think you will pay them mornay s wages . we bid you to edinburgh . meet us at the city gates , two days from now , at sunset . pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you . scotland will be one .
he has already agreed to come .
my father hears that longshanks has granted prima noctes .
clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here .
he strained his leg so that it pains him to ride . but he sends his greetings and says that i speak for all the bruces . and for scotland .
no . but his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything . the balliols will kiss his ass , so we must .
he was a modest man .
it will not be long before longshanks too is encased in stone , and his crowns divided for others to wear .
homage is nothing . it is the crown that matters !
the crown is that of scotland . and scotland is william wallace .
that is another matter . there is a price to all this , required both by longshanks and our nobles . pay it , and you will be our king . and we will have peace .
he will . i know he will .
you are surprised he would lie ? balliol was murdered in a church yesterday . you are longshanks new designate . you will be king .
i hear . this wallace is a bandit , nothing more .
nothing new , majesty . we have sent riders to speed any word .
while i am in france fighting to expand your future kingdom i learn that stirling castle is lost , our entire northern army wiped out ! and you have done nothing ? !
i have ordered conscriptions . . .
impossible . how dare you bring a panicky lie .
so the scots will have none of them , will they ? my armorers have already made a thousand .
the scots will fight for us ?
what choice do they have ? now they must serve us or starve .
but if we have not caught wallace
he is gone ! finished ! dead ! if he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him , he will not survive the winter . it is very cold is it not , our flower ?
you let wallace escape your whole army . you cannot blame me for this .
you directed me to report to you the moment the king s conference was ended .
so i did ! and what was so important about it ?
scotland . he intends
. . . his majesty was quite keen that you should understand
all so very boring ! he wants me to learn to fight too , so let me do it !
look at me . i said look at me !
yes . i had thought that . . . i was loathsome to you . perhaps i am . if i may be excused , m lord .
you may .
you mock us with a smile ?
i am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries . all of england shudders with the news of renewed rebellion .
wallace s followers .
wallace himself . if you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every scottish town , i leave you to your hauntings . if you wish to take him , i know a way .
grant , as you do everything else , with treachery . offer him a truce to discuss terms , and send me to my castle at locharmbie as your emissary . he trusts me . pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along . and i will set the meeting , and the ambush .
simply because he eluded your trap , do you think he is more than a man ? my father is dying . perhaps you should think of our coronation .
when will his trial be ?
wallace s ? for treason there is no trial . tomorrow he will be charged , then executed .
you fancy him .
i respect him . at worst he was a worthy enemy . show mercy . . . oh thou great king . . . and win the respect of your own people .
before he lost his powers of speech , he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know wallace was dead .
hamish , i . . . thank . . .
fourteen ?
mornay has come . so will the bruce .
aye .
we are here to stay . we do not care to live , if we cannot fight beside ya .
i rest .
your rest is making me exhausted .
probably . but we cannot win alone . we know that . this is the only way .
i do not want to be a martyr .
nor i ! i want to live ! i want a home and children and peace . i have asked god for those things . but he is brought me this sword . and if he wills that i must lay it down to have what he wants for my country , then i will do that too .
that is just a dream , william !
we have lived a dream together . a dream of freedom !
your dreams are not about freedom ! they are about marion ! you have to be a hero , because you think she sees you ! is that it ?
my dreams of marion are gone . i killed them myself . if i knew i could live with her on the other side of death , i would welcome it .
no . one of us is enough .
how many ?
three , maybe more !
armed ?
they are english soldiers , ai not they ?
with your father and brother gone , they will kill us and burn the farm !
it is up to us , hamish !
i wanna have supper waiting .
we will get those english pigs tomorrow .
aye , we will get em .
you win .
call it a test of soldiery , then . the english will not let us train with weapons , so we train with stones .
the test of a soldier is not in his arm . it is here .
that depends on the man .
i could crush you like a roach .
i will not .
i should a remembered the eggs .
is your poppa a ghost or do you converse with god almighty ?
in order to find his equal , and irishman is forced to talk to god . yes , father ! . . . the almighty says do not change the subject , just answer the fooking question .
a common thief .
a patriot !
we do not split up !
they used hounds on us in ireland , it is the only way !
he was so brave . with courage alone he nearly won .
so more men were slaughtered uselessly !
he broke because of me . i saw it . he lost all will to fight .
we must have alliance with england to prevail here . you achieved that ! you saved your family , increased your lands ! in time you will have all the power in scotland ! . . . yet you grieve .
in my heart i had begun to hope that he would never break .
all men lose heart . all betray . it is exactly why we must make the choices we make .
your pardon , m lord , he asked me to come in his stead .
shall i leave , m lord ?
if he wants his queen to rule , then you stay and learn how ! i will deal with him .
no . he did not .
then why does he stay ? my scouts say he has not advanced .
he waits . for you . he says he will attack no more towns if you are man enough to come fight him .
you spoke with this wallace in private . what kind of man is he ?
. . . a mindless barbarian . not a king like you , m lord .
the scottish nobles have sent him no support . his army starves . our stall has worked , he must withdraw . you may return to your embroidery .
humbly , m lord .
this is what happens when you must send a woman . and a fool .
forgive me , sire . i thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule .
my greatness is better demonstrated with this .
let her speak .
he will fight you forever . but what does he fight for ? freedom first , and peace . so grant them .
against thy king , thou vile fool ! hast thou anything to say ?
never , in my whole life , did i swear allegiance to your king
it matters not , he is thy king !
while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times . i cannot commit treason , if i have never been his subject !
confess , and you may receive a quick death . deny , and you must be purified by pain . do you confess ? . . . do you confess ? !
i do not confess .
then on the morrow , thou shalt receive they purification . . . and in the end , i promise you will beg for the axe .
it is not you . he dislikes that you are a wallace . he just says . . . the wallaces do not seem to live for very long .
thank you for accepting .
thank you for inviting .
i will invite you again , but your mother thinks i am crazy .
you are . and i will come again .
some nights . i have dreams . mostly dreams i do not want . i started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when i did sleep i would dream only of the ride and the adventure .
did it work ?
no . you do not choose your dreams . your dreams choose you .
i . . . accept your proposal !
i am not just saying it !
nor i !
but i will not give you up to any nobleman .
you scare me .
i do not want to scare you . i want to be yours , and you mine . every night like this one .
this night is too beautiful to have again .
i will be with you , like this . forever .
shush . it is only been a day . and it is seemed like forever .
tonight then .
my parents are growing suspicious ! i cannot keep meeting you every night !
. . . tonight !
yes , you are . and you must wake .
i do not want to wake . i want to stay with you .
and i with you . but you must wake .
i need you so much ! i love you !
wake up , william . wake up !
how do you know this ?
last night i slept with a member of the war council .
he should not be telling secrets in bed .
ah , oui ! englishmen do not know what a tongue is for .
a magistrate wished to capture him , and found he had a secret lover , so he cut the girl s throat to tempt wallace to fight and fight he did .
. . . i would not know .
wife of edward , the king s son ?
it is battle i want , not talk .
but now that i am here , will you speak with a woman ?
i have been given nothing . god makes men what they are .
did god make you the sacker of peaceful cities ? the executioner of the king s nephew , my husband s own cousin ?
york was the staging point for every invasion of my country . and that royal cousin hanged a hundred scots , even women and children , from the city walls .
that is not possible .
a lordship . and gold . that i should become judas .
peace is made is such ways .
slaves are made in such ways !
she was my wife . we married in secret because i would not share her with an english lord . they killed her to get to me . and she was pregnant .
it does me good to see you .
because of the way you are looking at me now . the same way . . . as when we met .
i have taken vows . more than one . i have vowed faithfulness to my husband , and sworn to give him a son . and i cannot keep both promises .
i cannot love you for the sake of revenge .
no . but can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost ? or simply love me . . . because i love you ?
sir , i . . . come to beg you to confess all , and swear allegiance to the king , that he might show you mercy .
will he show mercy to my country ? will he take back his soldiers , and let us rule ourselves ?
mercy . . . is to die quickly . perhaps even live in the tower . in time , who knows what can happen , if you can only live .
if i swear to him , then everything i am is dead already .
every man dies . not every man really lives .
it will numb my wits , and i must have them all . if i am senseless , or if i wail , then longshanks will have broken me .
i cannot bear the thought of your torture . take it !
and the common man who bleeds on the battlefield , does he risk less ?
no . but from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself . its nobles share allegiance with england and its clans war with each other . if you make enemies on both sides of the border , you will end up dead .
we all end up dead . it is only a question of how . and why .
nobles ? what does that mean to be noble ? your title gives you claim to the throne of our country . but men do not follow titles , they follow courage ! your arm speaks louder than your tongue . our people know you . noble and common , they respect you . if you would lead them toward freedom , they would follow you . and so would i .
i am trying .
then tell me what a king is ! is he a man who believes only what others believe ? is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart ? there is strength in you . i see it . i know it .
i must . . . consult with my father .
and i will consult with mine .
they have tricked us .
that is the crazy man saying , lord ?
the dogs have a scent . my scent . someone must have given it to them .
who would do such a thing ?
exactly .
no english lord would trust an irishman !
bring out our spearmen and set them in the field .
aye . but it will not let me dream .
i am sorry , but can it wait til tonight ? i am already late for work
what is it ?
yesterday i had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up . most of them made drawings of what their parents did , but this . . .
of course . there is one more thing , mrs . treborn . and i feel bad for mentioning it . . .
what ?
when i asked evan about his drawing , well , he did not remember doing it .
not according to his teacher . it just got me thinking about jason and what if evangs inherited his father s condition ?
hold it , hold it , andrea . let s not jump to conclusions . i will run some preliminary tests , see what we can rule out .
look , andrea , i am sure he will test negative for brain disorders . but there s something else you can try to monitor his memory .
anything .
a journal . just have him write down everything he does .
why ? what for ?
it could be extremely useful to jog his memory . see if he remembers anything new the next day . and i will have the test results back in a few days .
and the bad news ?
unfortunately , we have got nothing to work with . it is harder playing detective now .
but you must have something to go on ?
if i had to guess , i would say the blackouts are stress related .
but he is seven . what kind of stress can he have ?
plenty . who knows ? maybe he is got severe coping problems about not having a father . did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend s dad .
come on , i doubt the answer s that simple .
you would be surprised how often they are .
well , he has been pushing me to meet his father , but i have been putting it off .
it is worth a shot . i can arrange a controlled meeting . a careful dose of sedatives for jason , some security , you and i monitoring . evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck , no more missing father complex .
how soon ? . . .
nine , ten . and you are awake ! open your eyes , dammit !
so what did you find .
the hemorrhaging . . . the neural damage is irreparable . i am frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions .
when did you ever care about getting to school on time ?
we are putting up pictures for parent s night .
thanks . do not worry evan , you will have plenty of time .
um . . . can dad come this time ?
you know the answer to that .
cannot he come out for one day ?
we have been over this a hundred times . it is too dangerous for him .
but lenny said that his dad s coming . . . and tommy and kayleigh s dad . . .
i get the point , kiddo . but i am not so bad , am i ?
no .
good . because i have been waiting to see your art projects all week and i would feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there .
you will be fine . dr . redfield just wants to give you some tests . you will like him .
my father has a bad memory , too ?
great . i will see you soon .
honey . what were you doing with that ?
i . . . i do not remember .
okay .
something must have happened ! what set him off ?
i . . . i blacked out .
do not try to use your blackouts to get out of this one !
i cannot help it . i am just so proud of you . you have got the highest grades in all of your classes .
did da jason get good grades ?
please . he got straight a s without ever touching a book . that was the one area where his memory never failed him .
ma ? did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time ?
no , it is just weird with him being such a brain and all , i just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he would forgotten .
when he was around your age . . . almost exactly your age . he said he figured out a trick to remember the past .
sure . . .
and then , just before it got so bad that he had to be committed , he said that he could . . .
what ? what could he do ?
how long will i be in here ?
i do not know . these things take time .
how is kayleigh doing ? she all right ?
damn it , mom . i told you i need them all !
fine . you will get them , evan . but i think it is far more important to focus on your case right now .
cute , evan .
he is saying it is like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year . overload city . sat about the gist of it , doc ?
fix ?
i just need the entry about the blockbuster . wait , shit , no arms . i never even got the chance to write it .
come on , mom . just cause dad was my age when he started going crazy does not mean that i am nuts .
you told me that on parents weekend . remember ? wait , that was not me . or you .
do not worry . i am gonna get you out of here .
can you protect me ?
jesus himself could not make me take on the brotherhood . when they come , just put your mind in another place , man . be somewhere else .
straight up .
because i think he sent me to your cell on purpose . for you to help me .
shit . i knew you were crazy .
i ai not bullshitting . jesus speaks to me in my dreams .
you need to see the prison shrink , man .
weirder than this ?
marks , scars , i dunno . anything could happen i guess .
signs of the lord . they just appeared out of nowhere . i thought you were loco !
so you believe me ?
you know my father ?
not in this wing , actually . no .
yes .
where are you now ?
i am standing next to kayleigh , my hands are over her ears .
are you hurting her ?
no , protecting her .
i see a car .
i cannot . . . the car vanishes and all of a sudden i am on the ground in the woods .
the car does not vanish evan . the movie in your head has broken , that is all . but now i have re spliced it and i want you to tell me about the car .
it is coming . . . argh ! i cannot !
are you sure ? not even with my father ?
lemme guess . would that be where the memories are stored ?
where are my goddamn books ?
books ?
my journals ! where are they ?
but i . . . i need those books .
you remind me of your father . he always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one .
photos ?
i thought you were a december baby .
this is bigger . seven years to the day . no blackouts .
like ozzy .
that is probably why hannibal lecter s so smart .
all i know is that i might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories .
what the fuck are you doing ?
shhh ! i need quiet for this .
what ?
shucks , i dunno . but maybe there s a reason why you have repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities , dammit !
huh ?
fuck off , frat boy .
sorry , dude . just figured it would be okay with you being sick and all .
so let s go . this place creeps me out .
shit , lenny . that is happened to you ! we have gotta get help !
you really do not remember anything that happened ?
i am sorry .
damn . your dad did this ?
what are you talking about ? what you deserve is a better brother and father . all they do is make you feel like shit .
he is been acting real strange lately . he will not even look me in the eyes anymore .
duck , here they come .
he must be . they are letting him go , right ?
hi , lenny .
oh , comme si , comme ca , you know . . .
no , evan . i do not know . it is been a long time . fill me in .
i am going to state now . things are going okay . i guess . mom s good . . .
i have stopped a hundred times .
so how is tommy ?
they kept him in juvy for a few years . now he works over at dale s autobody .
wow . that must have taken some courage .
not if you remember my dad .
could not you have moved in with your mom ?
she had a new family . not enough space for me . said i should have moved in with her when we were kids . but . . . whatever .
me ? are you kidding ? why ?
remember when i was a kid i had all these blackouts ?
of course .
well , lately some of the memories have begun to come back and i would kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular . it would be a big help .
well , sure . i will try to remember . shoot .
when we were kids . your dad was making a movie . robin hood or something ?
what do you want to know , evan ?
it is just . . . did he . . . what happened in the basement ?
it was a long time ago .
i know , but . . .
is that why you came all the way back ? to ask a lot of stupid questions about robin hood ?
no , but i think something really bad might have happened to us .
you cannot hate yourself just because your dad s a twisted freak .
who are you trying to convince , evan ? ! you come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory ! ? you want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything s all better now ? well fuck you , evan ! nothing s gonna be all better ! okay ? ! nothing ever gets better !
mmmm . . . you give good compliment . clean up and come back to bed .
those are your clothes , silly .
well i remember he had one . . . but he , like , put it away after the first day . why would that freak me out ?
i dunno . just being weird .
so it did not feel . . . weird ?
yeah , if you call multiple orgasms weird .
as if my dad could have stopped me from seeing you . that is he gonna do to me ?
you will see .
go on . sit down .
simple math . when i woke up this morning and saw your smile . . . i knew that i wanted to spend the rest of my life with you .
might a been nice . like this is gonna do any good . maybe one of the frat guys has a gun .
please , evan . do not even joke . he would not hurt you . he is just trying to scare you away from me .
yeah , right . tell that to crockett .
it is not his fault , evan . you knew how bad he had it when we were kids .
do not give me this oprah book club bad upbringing shit , because you turned out fine .
my father never laid a hand on me . it is like the prick saved it all up for tommy .
what do you mean ?
it is just . . . you have been acting kinda strange , you know ?
like how ?
i do not know . you seem . . . different . you make weird jokes . your accents changed . you do not even walk the same .
i walk differently ?
i cannot put my finger on it , but everything s a bit off . even the dinner tonight . it was beautiful , but . . .
i know i have been actin strange lately . it is just that . . . i do not want anything to happen to us .
what ?
he is a fucking maniac !
evan . stop it . it is not the time .
now s the only time ! today you get a chance to redeem yourself . start over with a clean slate . tabula rasa
nice to see you , too . can i come in ?
i get it . you can drop it now .
oh , i am sorry . does my line of work make you uncomfortable , precious ?
no . just that you need to hurt me with it . i have been where you have been .
ha ! where is that ?
the bottom . when you are just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack .
you would not believe me . i mean , people always say , you would not believe me , but in this case , it is not even worth trying .
i have seen some sickening shit . i do not blink twice anymore , especially in your case .
why s that ?
because you are . . . different .
different ? how ?
let me ask you a question . just a little one that is been gnawing at me for years .
yeah ?
on the bridge . how did you know that tommy had your dog ? that was no fucking hunch .
do you remember when i was a kid and i had those blackouts ?
i never thought you would . that is why i have never bothered to tell a soul until now , and why i never will again .
i am the only person you have told ? that is a great line . does that make other girls swoon ? do they actually eat up this bullshit ?
i could not give a shit if you believe me or not , and frankly i am too tired to prove it to you .
oh ? there s proof now ?
shit . i dunno . how would i know about the twin moles on your inner thigh ?
anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that .
then forget that . how about . . . you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers , you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you , it reminds you of your step sister .
know what ?
that i did not leave you there to rot .
which is ?
there is no fucking way on this planet or any other that i was in some fucking sorority .
do not think i will need it where i am going .
off to change everyone s life again , is that it ? maybe this time you will pop up in some mansion while i wind up in tijuana doing the donkey act .
i am over it . whenever i try to help anyone it all turns to shit .
well , do not give up now , slick . you have already done so much for me . hell , why do not you go back in time and save mrs . halpern and her baby . then maybe lenny would not freak out and ruin my family .
we have to get you to sunnyvale . you are having one of your famous hemorrhages .
stop ! take me back !
he saved mrs . halpern ? please , the twisted fuck .
yeah , i think i gotta get these fixed or something .
sure , evan , why not ? you were the first person i really ever cared about .
i was ?
that is why when i was little i never went to live with my mother .
i do not get it .
when my folks split , they gave me and tommy a choice who we wanted to live with . i could not stand my dad , but i knew if i moved to my mom s i would never see you again .
i never knew that . so then you still sometimes think of us . . . together ?
it is crossed my mind from time to time .
and . . . ?
well a lot of things cross my mind . i have always been a fast thinker , ev . i can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second . boom we fall in love get married two kids , your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature kids grow old as do we , relatively stable relationships , matching burial plots , the whole bit . it took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine .
then you think it might have worked out ?
why not ? but that is not how things wound up . i am with lenny , lenny s your friend . and there it ends .
that is right , evan , and you get to be the star .
calm down , kid . stand still .
quit acting like some retard or i will call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you have been .
kayleigh ? what happened ?
it is time for you to stand where the hell i told you .
wrong answer , fuckbag . this is the very moment of your reckoning . in the next thirty seconds you are going to open one of two doors . the first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood .
it will change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father . ultimately , it will lead to her suicide . nice work , daddy .
who who are you ?
. . . yes .
listen close then , fuckbag . you screw up again and i swear i will flat out castrate you .
and i will tell the child protective services about your kiddie porn endeavors . one step closer and i will shove this up your ass !
been there , done that .
uh huh . mom says i have your eyes and your
look , jason , i need some fast answers if i am ever gonna fix what i have done .
but it did not . and now i need info to make things right again and you are the only one who can give it to me .
there is no right . when you change who people are , you destroy who they were .
who s to say you cannot make things better ?
bullshit . i will send you a postcard when i have made everything perfect again .
we will find out soon enough .
me neither .
damn , evan , on the d . l .
thanks . wow . hey , i want to do something really special for kayleigh tomorrow . if i said i needed some help from you and the brothers . . .
i would say blow me . get the pledges to do it .
typical psych major . a complete wise ass . and how is your project coming ? still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation ?
hey , i got no choice .
oh , fine i guess . it is been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up , so i have not . . .
i know , i know . who can think of worms when your libido s in full swing , right ?
i will not let you down , professor carter .
i still owe you an essay from last week . is there any way i could get an extension ?
and you are . . . ?
evan treborn .
the answer s no , mr . treborn . now take a seat . the exam s about to begin .
maybe if i can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function , it will help me understand the complexities of the human brain .
thumper had a busy afternoon .
you are kidding . he is so . . . big .
yeah . i have been keeping journals since i was seven .
wow . . . read something .
deal . now read me something .
it was like tommy was possessed or something . there was a hate in his eyes that i could not really call human .
maybe because they never do . so don juan , you pass out on all your dates ?
sure . i was gonna make a new one , anyway .
gee , thanks friend .
yeah , good , what else do you remember ?
drop it or i will slit your mother s throat in her sleep .
y . . . yes . i guess i did .
forget it . that is the point of psych now ? tomorrow i could wake up as some dirt farmer in bangladesh .
my mom packed for me . i think she sent everything i ever owned . so we will see .
duly noted . now i am gonna ask you for one last favor .
what ?
shhh . i need to concentrate on the blockbuster if i am gonna destroy it .
destroy it ?
if i had not blown my arms off , mom never woulda started smoking in the first place . now shhhh .
fat little baby , crying for mommy .
hold your horses , man . it is here somewhere . i saw it when i was a kid .
what happened ? ? where are we ? !
that is wrong with you ? !
get this us shit . as if i was gonna lay a hand on my own sister . you have done nicely for yourself , evan . nice friends , nice life , not to mention you are fucking my sister . not a bad piece of ass if i say so myself .
it was not enough that the whole world loves you , but you had to take away the last person on earth who did not think i was a piece of shit .
no one thinks you are a piece of shit , tommy .
right , evan . i believe you just said sick fuck .
i will do whatever you want . you do not want me to ever see kayleigh again , fine . just let crockett go . besides , you kill him now and they will stick you in juvy for sure . and i know you would never leave your sister alone with your father .
oh goody , nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of hava nagila til i puke .
sorry , mrs . t . he is been out of sorts lately .
i think i will go check out the chapel .
huh ?
nothing . just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that .
i come from a big family .
meant no offense .
none taken . hey , uh , does kayleigh miller still work here ?
sorry . never heard of her .
i do not think evan gets to be in it
quit it , tommy . evan gets to be robin hood . i am gonna be maid marian , and you are the sheriff of nottingham !
i thought i was the bad guy !
you are , silly . he is a bad sheriff .
where the hell are you taking us anyway ? just blow something up already .
just blow something up ? are you nuts ? there s an art to mass destruction . would you just paint the mona lisa ? no . besides , we are here already .
i am sorry .
oh my god oh my god . . .
aw , hey now , that was a compliment .
you are such a retard !
what ? no frigging way , man . i am not touching that thing .
the hell you are not . anyone of us does it , you will puss out and narc for sure .
ai not gonna work this time , buddy . look how small that fuse is ! i will get killed .
yeah , you do that , lenny .
yes ?
could i speak to you for just a moment , please ?
i came with captain renault .
i should have known .
my husband is with me , too .
he is ? well , captain renault s getting broadminded . sit down . will you have a drink ?
no .
oh , he is just like any other man , only more so .
no , i mean , is he trustworthy ? is his word
now , just a minute . who told you to ask me that ?
he did . captain renault did .
i thought so . where is your husband ?
at the roulette table , trying to win enough for our exit visa . well of course , he is losing .
eight weeks . we come from bulgaria . oh , things are very bad there , monsieur . a devil has the people by the throat . so , jan and i , we , we do not want our children to grow up in such a country .
so you decided to go to america .
yes , but we have not much money , and traveling is so expensive and difficult . it was much more than we thought to get here . and then captain renault sees us and he is so kind . he wants to help us .
yes , i will bet .
he tells me he can give us an exit visa , but we have no money .
does he know that ?
oh , yes .
and he is still willing to give you a visa ?
yes , monsieur .
and you want to know
will he keep his word ?
he always has .
and he never knew , and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart ? that would be all right , would not it ?
you want my advice ?
oh , yes , please .
go back to bulgaria .
oh , but if you knew what it means to us to leave europe , to get to america ! oh , but if jan should find out ! he is such a boy . in many ways i am so much older than he is .
yes , well , everybody in casablanca has problems . yours may work out . you will excuse me .
he is just a lucky guy .
well ?
thank you , but i hardly think
then perhaps for the lady . the ring is quite unique .
what is your name ?
berger , norwegian , and at your service , sir .
i am sorry . it is .
yes , monsieur .
a champagne cocktail , please .
in a concentration camp , one is apt to lose a little weight .
we read five times that you were killed in five different places .
as you see , it was true every single time . thank heaven i found you , berger . i am looking for a man by the name of ugarte . he is supposed to help me .
but we who are still free will do all we can . we are organized , monsieur , underground like everywhere else . tomorrow night there is a meeting at the caverne du bois . if you would come . . .
no thanks , carl .
monsieur rick !
how long can i afford to stay closed ?
oh , two weeks , maybe three .
maybe i will not have to . a bribe has worked before . in the meantime , everybody stays on salary .
oh , thank you , herr rick . sacha will be happy to hear it . i owe him money .
i will . then i am going to the meeting of the
do not tell me where you are going .
i will not .
goodnight .
goodnight , monsieur rick .
come up here a minute .
i want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance . it might attract the police .
but sacha always puts out that light
tonight he forgot .
yes , i come , i will do it .
yes , sir .
well , i will get it from the safe .
i am so upset , monsieur rick . you know i cannot understand
forget it , emil . mistakes like that happen all the time .
i am awfully sorry .
it shall not happen again , monsieur .
that is all right .
er , good luck , yes .
i would better be going .
er , my check , please .
i have to warn you , sir . i beseech you . . .
it has been a pleasure to meet you .
hello , ferrari . how is business at the blue parrot ?
fine , but i would like to buy your cafe .
it is not for sale .
you have not heard my offer .
it is not for sale at any price .
what do you want for sam ?
i do not buy or sell human beings .
that is too bad . that is casablanca s leading commodity . in refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market .
suppose you run your business and let me run mine .
suppose we ask sam . maybe he would like to make a change .
suppose we do .
my dear rick , when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy ?
no hurry . i will have it sent over . have a drink with me .
i never drink in the morning . and every time you send my shipment over , it is always just a little bit short .
carrying charges , my boy , carrying charges . here , sit down . there s something i want to talk over with you , anyhow .
you are a fat hypocrite . you do not feel any sorrier for ugarte than i do .
practically no one .
if i could lay my hands on those letters , i could make a fortune .
so could i . and i am a poor businessman .
i have a proposition for whoever has those letters . i will handle the entire transaction , get rid of the letters , take all the risk , for a small percentage .
and the carrying charges ?
naturally there will be a few incidental expenses . that is the proposition i have for whoever has those letters .
i will tell him when he comes in .
rick , i will put my cards on the table . i think you know where those letters are .
well , you are in good company . renault and strasser probably think so , too .
rick , do not be a fool . take me into your confidence . you need a partner .
it is certainly not good enough . but since i am in a hurry , it will have to do .
oh , by the way , my agreement with sam s always been that he gets twenty five percent of the profits . that still goes .
hmmm . i happen to know that he gets ten percent . but he is worth twenty five .
and abdul and carl and sacha , they stay with the place , or i do not sell .
of course they stay . rick s would not be rick s without them .
well , so long .
i shall remember to pay it . . . to myself .
as leader of all illegal activities in casablanca , i am an influential and respected man . it would not be worth my life to do anything for monsieur laszlo . you , however , are a different matter .
signor ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you .
we might as well be frank , monsieur . it will take a miracle to get you out of casablanca . and the germans have outlawed miracles .
well , good luck . but be careful . you know you are being shadowed ?
yes , something .
those letters were not found on ugarte when they arrested him .
not for sure , monsieur , but i will venture to guess that ugarte left those letters with monsieur rick .
he is a difficult customer , that rick . one never knows what he will do or why . but it is worth a chance .
thank you very much . good day .
good day .
you need not be concerned about me .
this morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave casablanca .
that is also true , except for one destination , to return to occupied france .
occupied france ?
uh huh . under a safe conduct from me .
what value is that ? you may recall what german guarantees have been worth in the past .
there are only two other alternatives for him .
what are they ?
it is possible the french authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here .
and the other alternative ?
my dear mademoiselle , perhaps you have already observed that in casablanca , human life is cheap . good night , mademoiselle .
how nice . you remembered . but of course , that was the day the germans marched into paris .
not an easy day to forget .
no .
i remember every detail . the germans wore gray , you wore blue .
yes . i put that dress away . when the germans march out , i will wear it again .
i will .
there s still nobody in the world who can play as time goes by like sam .
he has not played it in a long time .
we said no questions .
here s looking at you , kid .
in america they would bring only a penny . i guess that is about all they are worth .
i am willing to be overcharged . tell me .
and i was wondering .
yes ?
why i am so lucky . why i should find you waiting for me to come along .
why there is no other man in my life ?
uh huh .
that is easy . there was . he is dead .
i am sorry for asking . i forgot we said no questions .
well , only one answer can take care of all our questions .
i am on their blacklist already , their roll of honor .
it is the gestapo . they say they expect to be in paris tomorrow .
yeah . it is pretty bad timing . where were you , say , ten years ago ?
ten years ago ? let s see . . . . . . yes . i was having a brace put on my teeth . where were you ?
looking for a job .
ah , that is the new german . and judging by the sound , only about thirty five miles away .
i know very little about you , just the fact that you had your teeth straightened .
no , no , no , no . we must leave .
yes , of course , we
the train for marseilles leaves at five o clock . i will pick you up at your hotel at four thirty .
no , no . not at my hotel . i , uh , i have things to do in the city before i leave . i will meet you at the station , huh ?
all right . at a quarter to five . say , why do not we get married in marseilles ?
yes , i guess it is a little too far ahead . well , let s see . what about the engineer ? why cannot he marry us on the train ?
oh , darling !
i love you so much , and i hate this war so much . oh , it is a crazy world . anything can happen . if you should not get away , i mean , if , if something should keep us apart , wherever they put you and wherever i will be , i want you to know . . .
no . no , rick . not tonight .
especially tonight .
why did you have to come to casablanca ? there are other places .
i would not have come if i had known that you were here . believe me , rick , it is true . i did not know .
it is funny about your voice , how it has not changed . i can still hear it . richard dear , i will go with you any place . we will get on a train together and never stop .
please do not . do not , rick . i can understand how you feel .
huh ! you understand how i feel . how long was it we had , honey ?
i did not count the days .
well , i did . every one of them . mostly i remember the last one . a wow finish . a guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face , because his insides had been kicked out .
has it got a wow finish ?
i do not know the finish yet .
well , go on , tell it . maybe one will come to you as you go along .
it is about a girl who had just come to paris from her home in oslo . at the house of some friends she met a man about whom she would heard her whole life , a very great and courageous man . he opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals . everything she knew or ever became was because of him . and she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love .
yes , that is very pretty . i heard a story once . as a matter of fact , i have heard a lot of stories in my time . they went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs , mister , i met a man once when i was a kid , it would always begin . huh . i guess neither one of our stories was very funny . tell me , who was it you left me for ? was it laszlo , or were there others in between ? or are not you the kind that tells ?
it does not matter .
yes .
well , you can tell me now . i am reasonably sober .
i do not think i will , rick .
why not ? after all , i got stuck with a railway ticket . i think i am entitled to know .
last night i saw what has happened to you . the rick i knew in paris , i could tell him . he would understand . but the one who looked at me with such hatred . . . well , i will be leaving casablanca soon and we will never see each other again . we knew very little about each other when we were in love in paris . if we leave it that way , maybe we will remember those days and not casablanca , not last night .
did you run out on me because you could not take it ? because you knew what it would be like , hiding from the police , running away all the time ?
you can believe that if you want to .
well , i am not running away any more . i am settled now , above a saloon , it is true , but . . . walk up a flight . i will be expecting you .
no , rick . no , you see , victor laszlo is my husband . . . and was , even when i knew you in paris .
the stairs from the street .
richard , i had to see you .
you use richard again ? we are back in paris .
please .
your unexpected visit is not connected by any chance with the letters of transit ? it seems that as long as i have those letters i will never be lonely .
you can ask any price you want , but you must give me those letters .
i went through all that with your husband . it is no deal .
i know how you feel about me , but i am asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important .
do i have to hear again what a great man your husband is ? what an important cause he is fighting for ?
it was your cause , too . in your own way , you were fighting for the same thing .
i am not fighting for anything anymore , except myself . i am the only cause i am interested in .
i would not bring up paris if i were you . it is poor salesmanship .
please . please listen to me . if you knew what really happened , if you only knew the truth
i would not believe you , no matter what you told me . you would say anything now to get what you want .
what of it ? i am going to die in casablanca . it is a good spot for it .
i do not have to . i have got them right here .
put them on the table .
no .
for the last time , put them on the table .
if laszlo and the cause mean so much to you , you will not stop at anything . all right , i will make it easier for you .
it was not long after we were married that victor went back to czechoslovakia . they needed him in prague , but there the gestapo were waiting for him . just a two line item in the paper victor laszlo apprehended . sent to concentration camp . i was frantic . for months i tried to get word . then it came . he was dead , shot trying to escape . i was lonely . i had nothing . not even hope . then i met you .
why were not you honest with me ? why did you keep your marriage a secret ?
when did you first find out he was alive ?
just before you and i were to leave paris together . a friend came and told me that victor was alive . they were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of paris . he was sick , he needed me . i wanted to tell you , but i , i did not care . i knew , i knew you would not have left paris , and the gestapo would have caught you . so i . . . well , well , you know the rest .
huh . but it is still a story without an ending . what about now ?
now ? i do not know . i know that i will never have the strength to leave you again .
and laszlo ?
oh , you will help him now , richard , will not you ? you will see that he gets out ? then he will have his work , all that he is been living for .
all except one . he will not have you .
all right , i will . here s looking at you , kid .
i wish i did not love you so much .
no , not yet .
but it is all right , is not it ? you were able to arrange everything ?
everything is quite all right .
oh , rick !
because you are getting on that plane .
i do not understand . what about you ?
i am staying here with him til the plane gets safely away .
last night we said a great many things . you said i was to do the thinking for both of us . well , i have done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing . you are getting on that plane with victor where you belong .
but richard , no , i , i
you have got to listen to me . do you have any idea what you would have to look forward to if you stayed here ? nine chances out of ten we would both wind up in a concentration camp . is not that true , louis ?
no .
maybe not today , maybe not tomorrow , but soon , and for the rest of your life .
but what about us ?
we will always have paris . we did not have , we would lost it , until you came to casablanca . we got it back last night .
and i said i would never leave you .
and you never will . but i have got a job to do , too . where i am going you cannot follow . what i have got to do you cannot be any part of . ilsa , i am no good at being noble , but it does not take much to see that the problems of three little people do not amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world . someday you will understand that . now , now . . .
she tried everything to get them , and nothing worked . she did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me , but that was all over long ago . for your sake , she pretended it was not , and i let her pretend .
hello , miss ilsa . i never expected to see you again .
yes , ma am . a lot of water under the bridge .
some of the old songs , sam .
yes , ma am .
i do not know . i ai not seen him all night .
not tonight no more . he ai not coming . uh , he went home .
does he always leave so early ?
oh , he never . . . well . . . he is got a girl up at the blue parrot . he goes up there all the time .
you used to be a much better liar , sam .
leave him alone , miss ilsa . you are bad luck to him .
play it once , sam , for old time s sake .
i do not know what you mean , miss ilsa .
play it , sam . play as time goes by .
oh i cannot remember it , miss ilsa . i am a little rusty on it .
if we would walk out so soon , it would only call attention to us . perhaps ugarte s in some other part of the cafe .
will not you join us ?
victor , i am afraid for you .
we have been in difficult places before , have not we ?
be careful .
i will , do not worry .
goodnight .
goodnight .
please , ilsa , do not be hasty .
no , victor , no .
but , victor , if the situation were different , if i had to stay and there were only a visa for one , would you take it ?
yes , i would .
i meant to , but something always held me up . i love you very much , ilsa .
and as far away from major strasser as possible .
we will discuss it later .
victor , please , do not go to the underground meeting tonight .
i must . besides , it is not often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife .
to tell you the truth , i am frightened too . shall i remain here in our hotel room hiding , or shall i carry on the best i can ?
apparently he has the letters .
yes ?
but no intention of selling them . one would think if sentiment would not persuade him , money would .
he suggested i ask you .
ask me ?
yes . he said , ask your wife . i do not know why he said that .
yes ?
when i was in the concentration camp , were you lonely in paris ?
i know how it is to be lonely . is there anything you wish to tell me ?
no , victor , there is not .
i love you very much , my dear .
you do not even have to say it . i will believe . goodnight , dear .
of course , i will be careful .
yes , i am ready . goodbye , rick . god bless you .
sam ?
yes .
he came from paris with rick .
rick ? who s he ?
mademoiselle , you are in rick s and rick is
is what ?
well , mademoiselle , he is the kind of a man that , well , if i were a woman and i . . . were not around , i should be in love with rick . but what a fool i am talking to a beautiful woman about another man .
oh , you have already met rick , mademoiselle ?
this is mr . laszlo .
i was not sure you were the same . let s see , the last time we met
you are saying this only to make me go .
how do you do ?
one hears a great deal about rick in casablanca .
and about victor laszlo everywhere .
will not you join us for a drink ?
what for ?
your work .
thank you . i try .
we all try . you succeed .
not at all .
any time .
signor ferrari is the fat gent at the table .
good evening . you see , here we are again .
i take that as a great compliment to sam . i suppose he means to you paris of , well , happier days .
go ahead .
well , is not there some other place ? it is rather confidential , what i have to say .
my office .
right .
i am not interested in politics . the problems of the world are not in my department . i am a saloon keeper .
my friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record . you ran guns to ethiopia . you fought against the fascists in spain .
what of it ?
is not it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog ?
yes . i found that a very expensive hobby , too . but then i never was much of a businessman .
i appreciate it , but i do not accept it .
i will raise it to two hundred thousand .
my friend , you could make it a million francs , or three , my answer would still be the same .
there must be some reason why you will not let me have them .
there is . i suggest that you ask your wife .
i beg your pardon ?
i said , ask your wife .
my wife ?
thank you .
had a close one , eh ?
yes , rather .
we might as well question why we breathe . if we stop breathing , we will die . if we stop fighting our enemies , the world will die .
what of it ? then it will be out of it is misery .
yes , i get the point .
you seem to know all about my destiny .
i know a good deal more about you than you suspect . i know , for instance , that you are in love with a woman . it is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman . the first evening i came here in this cafe , i knew there was something between you and ilsa . since no one is to blame , i , i demand no explanation . i ask only one thing . you will not give me the letters of transit . all right . but i want my wife to be safe . i ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from casablanca .
you love her that much ?
apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause . well , i am also a human being .
oh , save it . we have still lots of things to do .
keep it . you will need it in america .
but we made a deal .
oh , never mind about that . you will not have any trouble in lisbon , will you ?
no . it is all arranged .
good . i have got the letters right here , all made out in blank .
all except one thing . there s something you should know before you leave .
monsieur blaine , i do not ask you to explain anything .
i am going to anyway , because it may make a difference to you later on . you said you knew about ilsa and me .
yes .
but you did not know she was at my place last night when you were . she came there for the letters of transit . is not that true , ilsa ?
here it is .
yes .
i am captain renault , prefect of police .
yes . what is it you want ?
merely to welcome you to casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay . it is not often we have so distinguished a visitor .
thank you . i hope you will forgive me , captain , but the present french administration has not always been so cordial . may i present miss ilsa lund ?
i was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit casablanca . that was a gross understatement .
no . please , monsieur , it is a little game we play . they put it on the bill , i tear the bill up . it is very convenient .
very well .
no . two champagne cocktails , please .
this is a very interesting cafe . i congratulate you .
ilsa , i do not wish to be the one to say it , but it is late .
so it is . and we have a curfew here in casablanca . it would never do for the chief of police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself .
we will be there .
goodnight .
i slept very well .
that is strange . nobody is supposed to sleep well in casablanca .
may we proceed with the business ?
with pleasure . will not you sit down ?
thank you .
well , perhaps i shall like it in casablanca .
i was in a german concentration camp for a year . that is honor enough for a lifetime .
thank you .
by the way , monsieur , last night you evinced an interest in signor ugarte .
yes .
i believe you have a message for him ?
nothing important , but may i speak to him now ?
are you quite finished with us ?
you were a czechoslovakian . now you are a subject of the german reich !
i should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on french soil .
this is hardly the time or the place .
then we shall state another time and another place . tomorrow at ten in the prefect s office , with mademoiselle .
captain renault , i am under your authority . is it your order that we come to your office ?
whether or not you succeed is , of course , problematical .
not at all . captain renault s signature is necessary on every exit visa . captain , would you think it is possible that herr laszlo will receive a visa ?
do not be in such a hurry . you have all the time in the world . you may be in casablanca indefinitely . . . or you may leave for lisbon tomorrow , on one condition .
and that is ?
you know the leaders of the underground movement in paris , in prague , in brussels , in amsterdam , in oslo , in belgrade , in athens .
even in berlin .
yes , even in berlin . if you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts , you will have your visa in the morning .
if i did not give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more persuasive methods at your disposal , i certainly will not give them to you now .
herr laszlo , you have a reputation for eloquence which i can now understand . but in one respect you are mistaken . you said the enemies of the reich could all be replaced , but there is one exception . no one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape .
you will not dare to interfere with me here . this is still unoccupied france . any violation of neutrality would reflect on captain renault .
good day .
thank you , captain . it is very good to be here .
major strasser , my aide , lieutenant casselle .
oh , we germans must get used to all climates , from russia to the sahara . but perhaps you were not referring to the weather .
what else , my dear major ?
by the way , the murder of the couriers , what has been done ?
realizing the importance of the case , my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects .
i have already heard about this cafe , and also about mr . rick himself .
good evening , captain .
champagne and a tin of caviar .
may i recommend veuve cliquot , a good french wine .
thank you .
i expected no less , captain .
how do you do , mr . rick ?
well , personally , major , i will take what comes .
do you mind if i ask you a few questions ? unofficially , of course .
how about new york ?
you were not always so carefully neutral . we have a complete dossier on you .
i admit he is very clever . three times he slipped through our fingers . in paris he continued his activities . we intend not to let it happen again .
perhaps .
mademoiselle .
if rick has the letters , he is much too smart to let you find them there .
you give him credit for too much cleverness . my impression was that he is just another blundering american .
but we must not underestimate american blundering . i was with them when they blundered into berlin in .
it may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here .
my dear major , we are trying to cooperate with your government , but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people .
i have no conviction , if that is what you mean . i blow with the wind , and the prevailing wind happens to be from vichy .
and if it should change ?
a leader , like laszlo ?
uh , huh . i have been thinking . it is too dangerous if we let him go . it may be too dangerous if we let him stay .
i see what you mean .
but everybody s having such a good time .
yes , much too good a time . the place is to be closed .
but i have no excuse to close it .
find one .
victor laszlo is on that plane .
ask monsieur rick .
how extravagant you are , throwing away women like that . someday they may be scarce .
when it comes to women , you are a true democrat .
why ? that is in lisbon ?
the clipper to america .
and what in heavengs name brought you to casablanca ?
my health . i came to casablanca for the waters .
waters ? what waters ? we are in the desert .
i was misinformed .
huh !
what , again ?
this is no ordinary arrest . a murderer , no less .
i stick my neck out for nobody .
a wise foreign policy .
our entertainment is enough .
perhaps not .
yeah ? have a brandy ?
thank you . rick , there are many exit visas sold in this cafe , but we know that you have never sold one . that is the reason we permit you to remain open .
i thought it was because we let you win at roulette .
that is another reason . there is a man who s arrived in casablanca on his way to america . he will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa .
yeah ? that is his name ?
victor laszlo .
victor laszlo ?
well , he is succeeded in impressing half the world .
it is my duty to see that he does not impress the other half . rick , laszlo must never reach america . he stays in casablanca .
it will be interesting to see how he manages .
manages what ?
his escape .
oh , but i just told you .
stop it . he escaped from a concentration camp and the nazis have been chasing him all over europe .
this is the end of the chase .
twenty thousand francs says it is not .
i just paid out twenty . i would like to get it back .
make it ten . i am only a poor corrupt official .
okay .
done . no matter how clever he is , he still needs an exit visa , or i should say , two .
why two ?
he is traveling with a lady .
he will take one .
i think not . i have seen the lady . and if he did not leave her in marseilles , or in oran , he certainly will not leave her in casablanca .
maybe he is not quite as romantic as you are .
it does not matter . there is no exit visa for him .
louis , whatever gave you the impression that i might be interested in helping laszlo escape ?
because , my dear ricky , i suspect that under that cynical shell you are at heart a sentimentalist .
and got well paid for it on both occasions .
the winning side would have paid you much better .
maybe . well , it seems you are determined to keep laszlo here .
i have my orders .
oh , i see . gestapo spank .
excuse me .
and you already know herr heinze of the third reich .
i was born in new york city if that will help you any .
hello , ilsa .
thanks . i will .
another precedent gone . this has been a very interesting evening . i will call you a cab . gasoline rationing , time of night .
that was some going over your men gave my place this afternoon . we just barely got cleaned up in time to open .
louis , are you pro vichy or free french ?
serves me right for asking a direct question . the subject is closed .
well , it looks like you are a little late .
huh ?
who knows ? in her own way she may constitute an entire second front . i think it is time for me to flatter major strasser a little . i will see you later , rick .
yeah ? why ?
why do you interfere with my little romances ?
put it down as a gesture to love .
well , i forgive you this time . but i will be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde , and it will make me very happy if she loses . uh huh !
i am shocked , shocked to find that gambling is going on in here !
ricky , i would advise you not to be too interested in what happens to laszlo . if by any chance you were to help him escape
what makes you think i would stick my neck out for laszlo ?
because one , you have bet ten thousand francs he would escape . two , you have the letters of transit , now do not bother to deny it . and , well , you might do it simply because you do not like strasser s looks . as a matter of fact , i do not like him either .
well , they are all excellent reasons .
do not count too much on my friendship , ricky . in this matter i am powerless . besides , i might lose ten thousand francs .
you are not very subtle , but you are effective . i , i get the point . yes , i have the letters , but i intend using them myself . i am leaving casablanca on tonight s plane , the last plane .
huh ?
and i am taking a friend with me . one you will appreciate .
what friend ?
ilsa lund . that ought to put your mind to rest about my helping laszlo escape . the last man i want to see in america .
you did not come here to tell me this . you have the letters of transit . you can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please . why are you interested in what happens to laszlo ?
it certainly would . germany . . . vichy would be very grateful .
then release him . you be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves .
there s still something about this business i do not quite understand . miss lund , she is very beautiful , yes , but you were never interested in any woman .
well , she is not just any woman .
i will make the arrangements right now with laszlo in the visitor s pen .
ricky , i am going to miss you . apparently you are the only one in casablanca who has even less scruples than i .
oh , thanks .
go ahead , ricky .
i was informed just as laszlo was about to leave the hotel , so i knew i would be on time .
i thought i asked you to tie up your watchdogs .
oh , he will not be followed here .
yes , i know what you mean , but i have already spoken to ferrari . you will still win at roulette .
is everything ready ?
tell me , when we searched the place , where were they ?
sam s piano .
serves me right for not being musical .
have you taken leave of your senses ?
i have . sit down over there .
put that gun down .
i do . we have got plenty of time to discuss that later .
call off your watch dogs you said .
just the same , you call the airport and let me hear you tell them . and remember , this gungs pointed right at your heart .
that is my least vulnerable spot .
you think of everything , do not you ?
and the names are mr . and mrs . victor laszlo .
stay where you are . i do not know what you are talking about .
anyway , thanks for helping me out .
i suppose you know this is not going to be pleasant for either of us , especially for you . i will have to arrest you of course .
as soon as the plane goes , louis .
maybe , but it seemed like a good time to start .
i think perhaps you are right .
my letter of transit ? i could use a trip . but it does not make any difference about our bet . you still owe me ten thousand francs .
and that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses .
our expenses ?
uh huh .
louis , i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship .
that is so long ago , i do not remember .
will i see you tonight ?
i never make plans that far ahead .
sacha , she is had enough .
do not listen to him , sacha . fill it up .
sacha , call a cab .
take your hands off me !
what is your nationality ?
i am a drunkard .
there seems to be no secret about that .
are you one of those people who cannot imagine the germans in their beloved paris ?
it is not particularly my beloved paris .
aha . who do you think will win the war ?
i have not the slightest idea .
you will forgive my curiosity , mr . blaine . the point is , an enemy of the reich has come to casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us .
my interest in whether victor laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one .
in this case , you have no sympathy for the fox , huh ?
not particularly . i understand the point of view of the hound , too .
victor laszlo published the foulest lies in the prague newspapers until the very day we marched in , and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar .
good evening , mr . blaine .
i was willing to shoot captain renault , and i am willing to shoot you .
put that phone down !
get me the radio tower !
put it down !
hello ugarte .
well , what makes you think i have not ?
oh , nothing . but when you first came to casablanca , i thought
you thought what ?
they got a lucky break . yesterday they were just two german clerks . today they are the honored dead .
you are a very cynical person , rick , if you will forgive me for saying so .
no .
i forgot . you never drink with . . . i will have another , please . you despise me , do not you ?
if i gave you any thought , i probably would .
but why ? oh , you object to the kind of business i do , huh ? but think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if i did not help them . that is not so bad . through ways of my own i provide them with exit visas .
for a price , ugarte , for a price .
but think of all the poor devils who cannot meet renault s price . i get it for them for half . is that so parasitic ?
i do not mind a parasite . i object to a cut rate one .
well , rick , after tonight i will be through with the whole business , and i am leaving finally this casablanca .
who did you bribe for your visa ? renault or yourself ?
myself . i found myself much more reasonable .
for how long ?
perhaps an hour , perhaps a little longer .
i do not want them here overnight .
do not be afraid of that . please keep them for me . thank you . i knew i could trust you .
do not be a fool . you cannot get away .
rick , hide me . do something ! you must help me , rick . do something !
i like it fine here .
he will double what i pay you .
yeah , but i ai not got time to spend the money i make here .
sorry .
yeah ?
boss , ai not you going to bed ?
not right now .
no .
you ever going to bed ?
no .
well , i ai not sleepy either .
good . then have a drink .
no . not me , boss .
then do not have a drink .
boss , let s get out of here .
no , sir . i am waiting for a lady .
please , boss , let s go . ai not nothing but trouble for you here .
she is coming back . i know she is coming back .
we will take the car and drive all night . we will get drunk . we will go fishing and stay away until she is gone .
shut up and go home , will you ?
no , sir . i am staying right here .
yeah , boss ?
sam , if it is december in casablanca , what time is it in new york ?
uh , my watch stopped .
i bet they are asleep in new york . i will bet they are asleep all over america .
just a little something of my own .
well , stop it . you know what i want to hear .
no , i do not .
you played it for her and you can play it for me .
well , i do not think i can remember it .
if she can stand it , i can . play it !
yes , boss .
you said it ! here s looking at you , kid .
the germans will be here pretty soon now , and they will come looking for you . and do not forget there s a price on your head .
no , mr . richard . i cannot find her .
six kilometers . four miles .
so how are we going to get this place shaped up ?
worse than warsaw .
nobody remembers that .
the failures they remember . it is the successes they forget .
catch another fish tomorrow .
stay calm , identify the problem . problem , rope fraying . solution , fix rope .
with what ? there s nothing to fix it with . this rope comes undone , you are going to drown .
feels so good to lie here .
get up , damn you .
you have had today s water .
thirsty .
come on , shape up , get going , you can do it .
no water , no work .
do too much , i will die .
do too little you will die .
going to die anyway .
take it .
no .
take it , damn it .
no .
wilson , do you believe this ? take the damn water .
survive today , that is the point .
you do not know where you are . you missed the shipping lanes .
moongs too bright .
i am putting it off .
fix raft first .
water water water
you idiot , if he dives , he will capsize the raft .
cannot kill another one . cannot . cannot kill my friends anymore .
you fucking bleeding heart , you kill or you die .
why do they have to die for me ?
they would eat you if they could . they are laughing at you . listen .
no !
you quitter you quitter you quitter .
the sea is lovely , dark and deep .
but i have promises to keep . and miles to go before i sleep . and miles to go before i sleep . got to fix the sea anchor . use the sail .
use the sail for a sea anchor and you will not move .
if i do not have a sea anchor i will capsize .
die tomorrow or die today .
grow up , stop being such a baby . other people get through a lot worse .
yeah , sure , what ?
thank you for fucking up my life .
i am dancing on the roof of the peabody hotel . with kelly .
they are on autopilot .
they are always on autopilot . or else it is night , or you are in the sun , or you are in the trough of a wave . they will never see you .
damn it ! do not be so negative !
i am serious . i am always going on about me , me , me . enough about me . your turn .
it is a fucking soccer ball , you idiot .
shut up .
you are .
look again , asshole . it is a mirage .
nothing out there but ocean .
let s get a second opinion . wilson ? what do you see ?
it matters . we do the best we can , that is all we have .
then we have just got shit .
shut up . i do not feel like dying today .
there was an unavoidable delay .
no .
as much as anybody .
want to come in ? get dry for a minute .
okay . sure .
possible . so you did those wings ?
yeah . a long time ago .
they are harder to do than they look .
oh ? you have tried ?
well , i do a little drawing
he was a sorry sonofabitch , and i am sorry i ever married him .
well , not really , i
you are . yes you are . what gave you the idea to paint on that cave ?
do you . . . have any more packages to deliver ?
no . that was the last one .
just sit here , i will get us some lunch .
sure .
i did not steal it , and he was not crippled .
had a package to deliver .
you ? personally ?
i had it on the island with me .
must be a story there .
i have got lots of time .
so do i .
hey , be nice to it , it will be nice to you .
you smell like formaldehyde .
let s take a look .
cold .
do not overwhelm me with details , you know how i hate that . did you get it fixed ?
i thought i did .
chuck , forget the xerox . so russia did not turn out well ?
what do you want me to say ? that i thought i would done a great job but it all turned to shit ? that i might as well have gone sailing for all the good i did ?
yeah , tell me . tell me all of it .
not if you work for fedex .
you do not seem too happy about it .
ah , the staff meeting could have gone better .
let me guess , russia came up ?
i figure , if we could take care of a puppy , we could , you know , take care of
he is your cute thing .
i cannot even keep fish alive .
a puppy s got a little more personality than a fish .
and for you
for when i travel ?
a ring . i wanted a ring .
you did ?
you cannot go now .
i have to .
you want to .
we are a little emotional here . it is christmas , maybe we are over reacting .
we are not over reacting .
could you watch jango ?
no .
i cannot take him to work .
it is our dog . it belongs to us .
there is not any us .
yes there is .
no , it was great . maybe a little overkill
i burned the christmas tree .
i guess i had not thought through how i felt .
what , you were going to come over the next day all calm and say , kelly that really made me mad ? do not tell me you are mad . be mad . be who you are right now .
look , we will do our trip as soon as i get back .
do not even start .
malaysia . they are holding the sweep .
a week , max . okay ? okay ?
go on . we will be fine . i will feed jango to the frogs .
hey . . . hey . . . it is okay !
a few things came up . or went down .
i thought you might have .
i would never
i know .
if i would known you were alive
i would have done the same thing .
you have any children ?
is that jango ?
no , this is jack . jango was hit by a ups truck . can you believe it ?
that is my sea anchor . my second one . made it out of part of the sail . it keeps you from capsizing in a storm . in theory . and this , this i used to collect water . about half a cup a day .
yeah , well . . . could not be helped .
my epitaph .
yeah , coffin , headstone , the whole thing .
what was inside ?
your calendar , your cell phone , your whoo pig sooey hat , some pictures of that ketch you wanted .
that about sums it up .
maybe now s when you tell me about it .
the plane went down . my friends died . i washed up on an island . then i found these barrels , built the raft , and here i am .
yeah ?
the tide came in , the tide went out . i survived . that is the headline . i survived .
do not overwhelm me with the details . you know how i hate that .
cliches , mainly . do not take anyone for granted . do not sweat the small stuff . live each day like it is your last .
so simple to say , so hard to do .
not when you have no choice .
i did not know what really being alone was . no one back here does .
that is what i told the fish i caught . but i ate them anyway .
great . really .
i do not know . i really do not know .
it means a lot . . . that you came .
i had to come . to be sure you were okay .
you too .
i am so glad you are alive .
and how was your christmas ?
terrific . yours ?
the regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow .
anything else ?
there s a sweep leaving memphis in an hour , goes through sydney .
under the circumstances your overall health is good . those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated , but they are healing nicely .
dehydration . vitamin deficiency . protein deficiency . any or all of the above .
all i ate was fish . that is solid protein .
protein digestion is very costly in water usage .
which i did not have .
and fish are very low in fat , which is energy inefficient . so you are going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat . luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas , which contain some vitamin c , so you did not get scurvy .
your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability , depression , anxiety , periods of self reproach . it is almost like schizophrenia . different sides of your personality might come to life , speak out , act out .
but all that is behind me . i am fine now .
i most definitely say i am .
doctor hegel tells me he discussed the vietnam pow syndrome with you .
you are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life ?
not to mention on me .
well , when that iv runs out , you are through with us . just the dentist tomorrow .
you bet i do . high tide comes right up to this road .
no .
hey , once a driver , always a driver . you want a lift ? i have just got one more pickup .
sure .
yeah .
let s eat .
so did i .
sixty three pounds consumed per capita , up from twenty seven in . going to pass beef . chickengs global . no religious taboos . you do not see your hindus and your muslims boycotting poultry .
true enough . no sacred chickens nowhere , so far as i know .
come on down to the plant . it is state of the art . we are doing for chickens what fedex did for the delivery business .
just do not count em before they hatch .
mom , meet jango .
it is nothing you did , mom , believe me .
that new roof , that is your doing .
oh no , the prodigal songs home . we bring out the store bought .
do not you even think about it .
the place is falling apart .
i am doing fine .
there s settled folks , and there s nomads . you are just not a settled folk . you never belonged here .
roger got me on . i was not doing anything , and but you are back , you are really back . i would have come to memphis , but
i wanted to come here .
this is my home . i am part of the wallpaper .
the tide saved me , mom . i lived by it . i am just wondering where it will take me next .
kamal , you are breaking up . can you hear us ?
what about the sender ?
sure . bettina peterson . marfa , texas . let s run a current check .
can you find her ?
you are looking at a level iii search . for your level iii , you gotta have e authorization . i do not have it .
who is this ? where is kamal ?
it is ibrim , i , i am a sorter .
that is going on down there ?
kamal is not here . we are very defused .
who s in charge then , where is chinn ?
borrowed . i borrowed it .
great . terrific . the good guys won one for a change .
it was fifteen minutes late .
but i might not have .
jesus . i got it working . . . you have no idea how hard it was . . . they are finally a team . . .
i am touched .
you fucked us over .
the point of fedex , as i understand it , is to make the damn connection .
i was making a point .
what ? let paris hold its plane ? let memphis take care of it ? let somebody down the line clean up your mess ?
every person counts , every package counts , that is my point .
you know what your problem is ? you just see the packages in front of you . you do not see the big picture .
baloney . i do see the damn big picture .
it is a ketch kelly and i had chartered .
for all those vacation days you got coming .
look , i am sorry about your plane . but i could not risk being late into memphis .
forget it .
you know general mclelland , he would not attack unless he had everything just right . finally abe lincoln came to him and said , general , if you are not going to use my army , could i borrow it for a while ? so he gave it to grant and grant just said , let s go .
i am from arkansas . tell me a story with robert e . lee in it and maybe i will pay attention .
we are warriors , not desk jockeys . we have got to be bold . you always want all your ducks lined up . but nothing s percent . it is always , maybe . hell , i would take . then roll the dice .
that is why you are a gambling man .
that is why i am running foreign and you are not . that is why you are not married and i am .
for the third time .
take the plunge , admit your mistakes , move on to tomorrow . that is fedex , that is women , that is life .
i am trying to help you here . there s warsaw , there s this
this was nothing like warsaw . i held the truck then minutes , it is not that big a deal .
ninety five percent ? just give me the money now .
talk is cheap . are we on or not ?
we are on .
right . get me everything on indonesia , new guinea , all the way to australia .
stan , it is chuck . . . chuck noland . . .

i am most definitely not dead . and as i recall , you are the sick fucker .
you beat em to shit , pal ! jesus !

time i had lots of .
forty three days .
i never thought it would end . then it did . it was so great to be saved , i could not stop laughing .
to wilson .
hallelujah .
that is it all about ? it is about being so thirsty you would crush a fish s backbone to suck out the spinal fluid that is what it is about .
to life .
that is all there is .
believe me i know .
digital laser readers . wow . terrific .
what ?
that is what it is about .
being patient . do not rush things . i get it .
deep , real deep .
deliver this package . then , i dunno .
you want that delivered , we will deliver it . that is what we do .
i need to do it .
finish what you started . you have not changed , chuck . it is still you .
no sweat .
permission granted .
may i ask , where are you bound ?
san francisco . and you ?
as it happens , i am headed for frisco myself .
would you do us the honor of joining us ? we are just sitting down at mess . pork chops and gravy , cranberries , baked potatoes with all the trimmings , fresh baked bread , apple pie . . .
no please , join me . some sundried fish strips , a few eyeballs , some gills to munch on .
try to think of nothing , dorothy .
it claims to restore monthly regularity .
life is waiting .
you were not dreaming about me .
i was !
you were ! you are ! it was fantastic .
it was just the ether , wilbur . . .
they just want you to hire some new help .
some new things would be useful . i do not need any new help .
let him try to make some money ! that is part of seeing the world , is not it ?
oh , just stop it ! you knew this was going to happen . he is a young man .
he is still a boy out in the world , he is still a boy .
just find him some clothes , wilbur . he could use some clothes .
it is that mrs . goodhall you have to be careful of , wilbur .
one has to be more than careful of mrs . goodhall she has sufficient christian zeal to start her own country ! i would like to give her a little ether .
an internship and two years of training at the boston lying in , south end branch . for his age , he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon he is also experienced in pediatric care . . .
you invented him ! you have completely made his up !
do not you understand ? the board is going to replace me ! that is what the new blood is for !
we all know who trained homer his credentials are as good as mine are . do not you be holy to me about the law ! what has the law done for any of us here ?
wilbur , he picked them for us himself . . .
you do not find it depressing that homer wells is picking apples ?
dr . homer wells .
i just hope he will not expect us to say grace all the time .
it is because he is too tired to sleep . he has to .
he smells like he could put you to sleep !
he is a doctor , buster doctors smell like ether .
you are a doctor , homer you do not smell like ether .
i am not a doctor . i have not been to medical school i have not even been to high school !
but you have studied with the old man for years !
i am not a doctor !
i am sorry , homer .
i know who you mean . i think about leaving here , but not to find them .
why not ?
whoever they were , they did not do any of the things parents are supposed to do . dr . larch did those things , and nurse edna , and nurse angela .
yeah . but sometimes i wish i could meet mine , anyway .
what for , buster ? what would you do if you met them ?
uh . . . i would like to show them that i can cook , a little .
you cook very well !
and that i can drive a truck !
better than i can !
sometimes i want to meet them so i can kill them . just sometimes .
i know .
i doubt it . she is just an . . .
i do not know . she got left here , like the rest of us , did not she ?
she died of secrecy , she died of ignorance . . .
i will tell them fuzzy was adopted .
why would the little ones believe that anyone would adopt him ?
they will believe it because they want to believe it .
should not we tell homer ?
if homer wanted to know what was happening here , he could pick up a telephone and call us .
i was looking for wally s letter . i was gonna show it to homer . . . they made him a captain already captain worthington !
daddy , it is a letter to me .
he mentions homer , too , you know .
wally said to say , hello .
good night , daddy .
daddy , please . . .
good night , daddy .
candy . candy kendall .
two .
no , but i work there i like it . my dad s a lobsterman .
i have never seen a lobster .
really ?
i have never seen the ocean , either .
he is going to be dropping bombs on mandalay ! they are going to be shooting at him !
where is mandalay ?
burma !
oh . . .
i cannot have a baby alone . i do not even know if he is coming back !
i understand .
it should taper off tomorrow , but it can come back again . you have cramps ? they will ease up , almost entirely . as long as the bleeding is not heavy , it is normal .
sure . . . i will see you around .
i am never bored ! it is all very . . . different for me . . . here .
when i am not thinking about wally . i am not good at being alone . oh , goodness . you meant . . . yes , i am fine . i . . . . . . i do not suppose you have seen a lobster yet .
okay . . .
i do not think mr . rose would leave without you .
yes . but it is closed all the time now , because of the blackout .
people watched the movies in their cars ?
when they watched at all . do you like movies ?
yes ! i have only seen one , though .
king kong . it is really good .
i did like it . all i said was , it is not king kong .
she did love him ! how many women have you known ?
she was torn apart ! she died of a broken heart .
oh , sure !
well , she was in a weakened condition . . . i do not know ! what about king kong ? ! is that medically possible ?
you think ? maybe i was . i love this place !
yes . . . and no . when you come here , you do not really care about the movie .
it was my favorite night at the orphanage movie night . we would race into the dining hall . of course everyone wanted to sit in front , so we would be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing .
at least you were never lonely .
i did not say that . growing up in an orphanage , you are always lonely . you are just never alone .
i miss things . i miss . . . people . i miss reading to the boys .
but you had so much responsibility .
i never asked for any responsibility .
just a little privacy .
did you come here with wally to not watch movies ?
ah ha . so what is that a radio ?
the speaker . for the movie sound .
you just cuddle . you come to hug . . . to kiss . you do not come here to watch the movie .
that is what i would come here for . i would watch the movie .
not with the right girl you would not .
nobody will swim here until next summer . by then , the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand there will not be any sharp edges .
right .
it will be okay .
what will be okay ?
we have to wait and see . i think that , for everything in life , you have to wait and see .
i am just waiting and seeing . like you said .
so we should wait and see . for how long ?
i grew up with wally . i began my adult life with him .
fine . that is all there is to it then .
no ! that is not all there is to it ! i love you , too i know i do .
okay , okay i know you do , too .
it is a good thing i did not have that baby , is not it ?
i told her ! she does not feel she can do that . something about her father not letting her go anywhere . . .
well , we have to help her !
well , we cannot force her . it is her decision .
you do not understand ! it is her father . . .
mr . rose knows ?
he is the father ! he is her baby s father !
we have got to keep her away from that bastard !
nothing .
is not that like waiting and seeing ?
no . nothing is nothing . i want wally to come home . i am afraid to see him , too .
i know . is that nothing .
no , do not that is something . nothing is nothing . do not even look at me . i want . . .
go anywhere ? of course not ! that would be doing something , would not it ? we would not want to do something . let s just sit here all night !
if you are trying to be funny , homer . . .
i am not trying to be anything i am just doing nothing ! if i wait and see long enough , then with any luck i will not ever have to make up my mind ! decisions can be painful , after all . . .
you got up ! you did something ! if you keep this up , you might be in danger of making a decision !
for god s sake , homer , wally s been shot down !
he is paralyzed !
he is alive . he still loves you . so do i .
what do you want me to do ?
no , that is not it i just want to be sure i understand you .
please . . . that is enough . i loved you , too you know i did .
. . . did . well , okay .
please do not . . .
and now that wally s coming back , and because he will certainly need you . . .
you say that as though it is some awful thing ! i never stopped loving wally !
she knows how to take care of herself .
sure . thanks .
i am sorry for what i said about wally needing you . it was . . . unnecessary .
no , i am the one who should be sorry . you have every right to be angry .
no . you warned me . i did not listen , but you warned me .
oh , he is fine ! i just heard from him . he is bombing all these places . . .
hi . . .
i do not need no more clothes , thank you .
rose , i know that is going on . homer told me . i got pregnant , too about a year ago . i have been through this .
yes , i have !
i cannot go nowhere .
why ?
no . it ai not muddy . muddy s just . . .
well , this is an orphanage .
i do not want you to walk i want to carry you . should i put the top up ? it might get cold .
no keep it down . i want to feel the air .
i never said they were boring .
you said , apples are not exactly flying .
well , they are not .
well , picking them is ! it is about as exciting as . . . walking !
i love you , too . see you tomorrow .
i know what you have been doing .
he loved it ! did not you ?
homer liked it ! did not you ?
they wanted a girl .
nobody ever wants me !
dr . larch would not let just anyone take any of us !
that is true .
nobody s asked for me , have they ?
nobody special enough , curly .
you mean somebody asked ?
only the right people can have you , curly .
how old are you , dear ? thirteen ?
you bet it is a heavy sedation ! the fetus is unexpelled , her uterus is punctured , she has acute peritonitis , and there s a foreign object . i think it is a crochet hook .
he is leaving . . .
homer was born here , in , what was it , ?
. . . graduated bowdoin college , , and harvard school of medicine , .
well , we can only guess about that , edna . they are against the law .
but what about school records ? homer does not have any diplomas . . .
he probably does not make much money picking apples he must have had to pay to send them , too .
i would not worry , edna , that he does not have money . if he gets hungry , he can pick his dinner !
edna ! come dance with me ! let s be foolish tonight .
does he know he is supposed to be in india ? does he even want to come back ?
cirrhosis it is a disease of the liver .
liver killed him ?
alcohol killed him he drank himself to death .
but did you know him ?
barely . it hardly mattered that i knew him .
did you know your mother better ?
she is dead now , too . she was a nanny .
that is a nanny do ?
she looks after other people s children .
did you grow up around here ?
no . she was an immigrant .
that is an immigrant ?
someone not from maine .
uh , sure that is what kong thinks , all right .
that is why kong loves her !
his father s dead , right ?
is that soon ?
why cannot we have pumpkins for christmas , too ? we do not get any good presents at christmas , anyway .
i do not remember .
it looks like you bit it it will be all right .
maybe i was kissing someone and he bit me .
no , you did it yourself . maybe in your sleep .
i must have been dreaming of kissing someone .
it is okay i do not mind .
no . dr . larch will be performing the procedure .
ah , well . . . okay . good ! i just wondered . . .
a b liberator .
liberator . . .
have you enlisted ?
they would not take me . i am class iv i have got a heart defect .
really ! is it serious ?
no , it is not serious . i am just not supposed to get excited . you know no strain , no stress . i try to keep calm all the time .
actually , someone did . i just did not think i could eat anything .
sure ! be glad to ! uh . . . a ride where ?
where are you going ?
we are heading back to cape kenneth .
you are a little overqualified , are not you ?
no , i am not . i need a job .
the only jobs are picking jobs . picking apples is truly boring .
i do not have any time . there s a war !
it is all very normal .
and over the himalayas . that is called flying over the hump .
i have got thirty five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet that is the first mountain pass .
actually , i volunteered .
oh , i would love that , wally .
migrants ?
yes . they pick fruit , all kinds . they travel up and down the coast with the seasons . the trick to mr . rose is , you have to let him be the boss .
what about the trees ?
the trees are flak antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground .
uh . . . actually , picking apples is as much excitement as i want for a while . i am grateful for the job .
you are the one who s helping me , homer . you are going to give my mom a little peace of mind while i am gone . candy , too .
well , sure . . . that is good , then . all i mean is , i am lucky i met you .
i do not think so , homer . i am the lucky one .
out back , there s a shed . it is just a mess . if that shed was better organized , i could put my truck in there .
right .
okay . . .
i guess so . . .
homer , you the only one who s read them rules , so you the only one who feels like he is doing something wrong .
what about the worms ? most of these apples are the drops off the ground , right ? there have to be worms .
of course there s worms , homer ! and what is them worms , really ? they just protein , them worms ! they is good for you !
this is easy i am not hurrying .
you still doing it too fast !
is it true ?
you are actually having sex with your own little girl ? is that possible ?
ai not nobody having sex with my little girl , homer that is something a father knows .
you are lying . how can you . . . with your own daughter !
go on , cut my clothes . i have got other clothes .
and i love her ! there ai not nobody else gonna treat her as good as i do ! i would not do nothing to hurt her , homer you must know that .
you forget yourself , homer . this here s my daughter ! you got your own mess to deal with ai not that right ?
mr . rose , i am in the doctor business . if you want , i can help you . you do not have to go anywhere .
one cervical stabilizer , two sets of dilators douglas points . one medium sized curette , one small one medium speculum , one large two vulsellum forceps .
there ai not no almost about this stuff , homer ai not that right ?
when it comes to this , you is the real thing is that what you saying ?
okay . then you can be of use .
where would she get you ?
she just plan misunderstand me i was trying to give her my knife , i was just reaching to touch her hand . but i understand if she misunderstand me it is all my fault , ai not that right ?
that is cause i sticked my own knife in the wound after she go , i sticked my own knife in there . i poked it all around , i just trying to find the same place she got me .
right ?
yes , for both .
i presume you would prefer handling the delivery .
all i said was , i do not want to perform abortions . i have no argument with you performing them .
you know how to help these women how can you not feel obligated to help them when they cannot get help anywhere else ?
one it is illegal . two i did not ask how to do it you just showed me .
what else could i have showed you , homer ? the only thing i can teach you is what i know ! in every life , you have got to be of use .
no . the fetus was dead . her uterus was virtually disintegrating my stitches pulled right through the tissue !
it looks like scurvy .
scurvy ! ah yes , the curse of the old time sailor , suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables . homer , dorothy is not a sailor !
obviously .
i do not know it .
if you take enough of it , your intestines lose their ability to absorb vitamin c .
in other words , scurvy .
good boy . good job . and you call yourself not a doctor ! keep an eye on her she is in trouble .
i have not read that .
i have not , either . but you will . the morons who write the books should do a little research here .
but is not fuzzy just . . . well , underdeveloped ?
when does not he have bronchitis ? i would not call his bronchial infections underdeveloped . would you ?
nobody s named this one yet .
it is my turn !
cannot a boy be a dorrit ?
i do not think so .
you do it then .
i am not crazy about the little . . .
we have not had a wilbur here in a year or so , have we ? we used to have dozens !
it is your splice ! you blame me for everything !
it is . i will get this . you go ahead .
how about this child ? you expect her to be responsible ?
i am happy i amuse you .
try to look at it this way . what choice does buster have ? what are his options ? nobody will ever adopt him .
try to look at it this way . buster and i are sitting right here beside you . we could have ended up in the incinerator !
happy to be alive , under any circumstances is that your point ?
i was not intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless i expect i will find some ways to be of use .
in other parts of the world , i suppose there are other ways .
of course .
are you really so stupid that you imagine you are going to find a more gratifying life ? what you are going to find is people like the poor people who get left here only nobody takes care of them as well ! and you will not be able to take care of them , either . there s no taking care of anybody not out there !
you know i am grateful for everything you have done for me . . .
i do not need your gratitude .
it is your heart you ought to take it with you .
you know everything i know , plus what you have taught yourself you are a better doctor then i am and you know it !
mrs . worthington , i feel i am very lucky to be here .
there s not a lot of work in the winter , and you will have to tolerate vernon even wally despises him , and wally likes everyone .
i do not know . just promise me one thing .
just promise me that , if there s a blizzard , you will move into wally s room until it is over .
right .
how long s this been going on , muddy ?
long enough . you ai not gonna stop it .
we heard that one already , homer .
two please do not go up to the roof to eat your lunch .
yeah , well . . . you could move on with us , man ! you could move on somewhere warm !
pretty , ai not it ? you a plumber ?
it is just my heart .
what you got a picture of your heart for ?
so what ?
yes , so what . it is nothing serious , really . just a small defect .
i cannot read . nobody taught me .
no trouble .
yeah , you is . i know when people is in trouble , and you is .
oh , i suppose you is a doctor , homer ?
almost .
i guess you must like watching me be sick . . .
i do not like watching anyone be sick .
not yet . what do you know about it ?
i know more than i want to know about it . who s the father ?
do not trouble yourself about it , homer this ai not your business .
but you do not look very happy .
happy ! what are you thinking ? how am i supposed to take care of a baby ! i cannot have a baby .
rose , please listen . whatever you want to do , i can help you .
you think daddy s gonna let me go anywhere ? i ai not going nowhere .
rose , listen do not do anything . you know , i mean to yourself . please listen . . .
that is it .
it means nothing at all ! and all this time i been wondering about it !
now , now . he is a good boy .
shit . we do not know what he is .
jack , you gotta watch your language round my daughter .
you think so , jack ? well . . . i would not want to be in that wally s shoes tonight .
them people drinking that cider , they do not know there s a cigarette in there !
it is not that hard to find it in there , jack it will take you just a minute . you just gotta go fishing .
you mean swimming . i ai not going in that vat to fish out no cigarette !
what business is you in , jack ? just tell me what your business is . . .
no ! i do not want to know him ! he is doing missionary work in india ! i wrote him weeks ago , but he is either too holy or too busy to answer . maybe he got killed in the war !
does it snow in bombay ? one winter here and we will be shipping him south , in a coffin !
you cannot think that a man who has served under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little snow have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of disease that part of the world is ?
then i suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him !
anyway , i was just showing you this guy as an example of that is available i did not think you would be interested .
why was he missing for twenty days ?
because the crew thought he would gone down with the plane . they were hospitalized for almost a week in china before they were flown back to india . it was not until that they sorted through their gear . . .
it is encephalitis b . he is recovering at mount lavinia hospital , ceylon . uh . . . captain worthington is paralyzed . waist down . he will not walk .
when will he be home , major ?
four weeks or so , right around halloween .
they told muddy his feet was too flat !
mind your own business , peaches .
sorry , homer . . .
we see you next harvest .
it look nicer then home !
what have you two been doing to make it look so nice ?
they ai not drops i picked em off the tree !
then you picking em too fast they ai not no better than drops to me . see that bruise , and that one ? half of these is bruised ! look at this one ! it ai not got no stem ! you might as well step on em , too they only good for cider .
who live here in this cider house , peaches ? who grind them apples , who press that cider , who clean up the mess , and who just plain live here . . . just breathing in the vinegar ? somebody who do not live here made them rules . them rules ai not for us . we the ones who make up them rules . we making our own rules , every day . ai not that right , homer ?
what view ?
well , muddy , we can look at all these angry stars homer s been reading to us about .
yeah , we can wait all night for the water to come back on you just go on and take your time .
tell that vernon to mind his own business , muddy .
i told him that you all is sick .
tell him what you want , muddy you is the crew boss today .
you taught her , i suppose . . .
that is right ! a girl s gotta know how to defend herself , do not she ?
that is right . i know you understand how i feel , homer you is breaking them rules , too . ai not that right ?
you lucky you in your work boots tonight , girl . . .
that is lucky about that ?
that is right that sounds like trouble to me .
now , now , darling . . . jack just needs to know what business he is in .
yeah , you really showed him , daddy you just about cut your own hand off , and all you cut off him was his clothes !
you oughta know you do not go to jail for cutting a guy s clothes . ai not that right , homer ?
you just stay out of trouble , homer !
you gotta let me go , daddy . please . . .
i ai not your business no more , daddy . please let me go .
that is right , homer . this ai not your business .
she is about the most beautiful girl i ever seen i do not know if she is the nicest .
the good news , jack , is you are half undressed for swimming . . .
yeah , that cigarette ai not hard to find when you are properly undressed .
she took off in the night !
she took off on the bicycle , man .
he ai not never been outta maine !
i was not sure if you would make it .
tough day ?
brutal day . they say the streets are lined with money down here , but i guess you have to know the secret handshake . what are you drinking ?
uh , maker s mark . rocks .
oh god . i am overbearing and rude . lily . lily finn .
it is more like what are not i doing . my partners and i are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company . we tried the venture capitalist route in the valley , but then again who has not up there .
silicon valley ?
that is right . so , brainiacs that we are , we thought we would be innovative and relocate east . try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here .
on me . for the seat . cheers .
well , typically , corporate loans are relatively simple matters , but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery .
no , no . nothing like that . i work in a bank .
really ? wish we had met eight hours ago .
you are welcome . i was just going to ask you if you would like to join us .
i envy you guys . taking a chance like that .
what do i do ? i am the vp of finance .
maybe you can help us understand that is so hard about getting a corporate loan .
well , typically speaking , they are not . as long as you can demonstrate
a capacity for gross fund recovery . yeah , we got that part .
that is right . and tech firms . . . they tend to scare people off .
they scare people off because most people lack vision . vision and balls . present company excluded of course .
banks need to know how they are going to get their money back .
we know exactly how we are going to make the money back . there in lies the catch
i do not follow .
big . com . that internet thing .
right . the guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the valley do . they get a good idea , shop it around , raise some capital , then sell it off to a bigger company . microsoft , intel , oracle , whatever . the beauty of it is , they have pretty much sold the company before they are even real . the bigger company is already set to buy it , all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works . so they get some start up capital , make it work , then sell it for like five times the initial loan .
sort of like a letter of intent .
exactly . but the catch is that you cannot tell anyone about the offer , because if it is public , you could start a bidding war and that is considered a breach of etiquette . it could kill a deal . but , wait too long and you are not considered hot anymore .
and you have this letter of intent ?
yes . that is why i wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little .
everything looks in order .
this has to happen fast .
i know . it will not go unnoticed .
there will be red flags .
you need some convincing . consider it a convincer .
you are worried about recouping the loan . i already told you .
no , i understand that . what i mean . . . what i am trying to say . . . i was actually wondering about . . . well , my cut .
the standard ten .
ten percent . of how much ?
two million .
jake ? right . uh huh . . . uh huh . . . yeah , it is going through
gordo plays the inside . you are the shill .
yeah , but come on . . . all i get to do is cry and get insulted .
what are you talking about ? you should get a fucking academy award for the shill work you do . we got it down cold , al . you do not want to jinx it by changing something up , do you ?
i am gonna go get eggrolls . anyone want eggrolls ?
it is alfonse . i want to settle up . i have not been ducking you . i told you i would get it .
know who i am , jake ?
the anti christ ?
no . i am not the anti christ . or the prince of darkness . i am just a guy looking for some answers .
gee . . . what makes you say that ?
your life flashing before your eyes ?
just the last three weeks .
that is not a bad place to start .
we cannot all be model citizens such as yourself .
it is all about the money , is not it ?
is not it always ?
and these cops ? what do they get ?
you never know when you can use a crooked cop .
keep going . i want to know how you got lionel dolby .
so you want to know how to play the big con .
in this case , you might say i want to know how not to play the big con .
suits used to say that in any con , sooner or later someone s going to start asking the right questions . usually , it takes a little longer .
that was it . we had our crew . now we needed the mark .
factors that were not clear to me until now .
cue the fucking violins . come on . . . it is getting cold .
we got our stake . now we need to find our guy in gillett s bank .
back in wwi or wwii , one of the ww s , if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match , some nazi would be able to figure out where you were . then , well . . . it was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had . so three on a match is bad luck .
you are a superstitious fucker .
luck s a funny thing . especially the bad .
like what ?
having a gun pointed at you for one . it is not like breaking a mirror bad luck , but it is bad . three on a match , black cats . . . believe it . believe it all .
my father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy . the same numbers everyday for sixteen years . one day he gets pissed off , tells them he is out and plays his own numbers . they hit the lucky seven for one point two million .
you know when the first con was ever played ? it was when adam fell for eve in the garden of eden .
i was doing it for them .
bullshit ! you were scared , jake ! you lost your nerve ! you lost your confidence ! you were not being noble . you were not trying to save anybody but yourself ! admit it .
it is not true .
yes it is , jake ! yes it is ! they were right there for you . she was right there for you ! look at her !
after you cut her loose .
she walked .
today ? started off great . . .
probably safe in the hands of the federal government .
it is like putting on a play , where everyone knows their part except for the mark .
like putting on a play . . . guess some people forgot their lines .
guess so .
so why do not you take a deep breath , jake , and i will count to ten . one . two . three . . .
let s see . . . let s suppose he gets to customs and he gets caught . we get our money back , but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation . i do not much like that idea . then again , let s suppose he actually gets through customs . now , that will be something . we recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud . we double our money .
so we go to the bar .
i think so . the airport s going to be crawling with police . traffic will be a nightmare . go down to the bar . if they pull it off , great . have someone deal with ashby .
we will take care of it .
and how much did you say you wanted for this . . . what did you call it ? a finder s fee ?
fine . but only if we recover the cash .
the cash we fleeced off of him was collection money . he was supposed to take that money and give it to the king earlier yesterday like he does every thursday . cept this time , he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the king s money back before any body says boo .
that is a king pin ?
mob ?
independent . same shit , just independent . they call him the king pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book . . . big . fat . bald .
so what ? we hide , right ?
what are you ? new ? let me tell you how good this guy is . last night , al calls this bookie to settle up . apparently he is been ducking him for like a month . so the guy asks him where he is got all this money all of a sudden , right ? what does al do ? does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking bar mitzvah bond ? does he tell him he is been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop ? no . . . he starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some wall street asshole type . . . how he fleeced .
you are pissed we did not get credit ?
no , that was the only semi fucking smart thing he said ! except anybody that is ever met big al knows that the only thing he is comfortable doing alone is eating . this guys tells this guy , that guy tells some other guy , eventually it works it is way back to someone who works for the king and
we sure big al threw him to us ?
come on . . .
we are going to give him the money back ?
alright , let s all put our dicks back in our pants for a second . is this the best thing to do ?
people have tried this before , jake . it is never worked . teddy fraiser and his crew went on vacation in chicago for it . last year , mumps got pinched in l . a .
it is not like she is a real redhead , jake . . .
i gotta work off some of this adrenaline . i got a line on this pawn shop guy over in brooklyn . anybody want in ?
so far , masters of our own demise . what bank are you with ?
it is alright . grant s one of the good guys .
let s go , jake ?
so what ? we just stay clear of him .
jake , i mean , come on
i told you , use less powder .
but you will not get that splatter effect .
that is a lot of cash . he came up with it pretty quick .
probably some investment banker or convertible bonds broker dickhead . did you see how fast he ran out of here ? it is done . he is not coming back .
i guess . i gotta drop a dime . did anybody mess up the hoop ?
i just do not know if this says , me . that is the fabric ?
well , this is just fucking great . . .
it gets worse . now i know why he was such a good rope . i mean , cash . . . that much and we never had to put him on the send ? turns out this ducking moe was an accountant for the king pin .
and what about big al ?
leave him . someone s going to find him eventually . then they will start looking for us , too .
tonight . just me .
yes , her . where is my wallet ?
two million .
we get fifty percent . and we get clear of the king .
how is that ? he works for gillette .
we pay better .
no , not whatever . you are either in or you are out .
here s that is going to happen . gordo , we need to find a guy in gillette s bank . miles , we need papers , corporate , insurance . . .
she is up for it .
so then miles walks straight into the creative director s office and says the code s fine , the program s for shit and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy s desk !
you sure ?
and all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow .
eight a . m . flight .
calls ?
we will use the euc .
what do i always tell you guys ? do not spend it all . sooner or later we are going to run into some bad luck . save some . put it away , so when shit like this happens , you are not desperate . that is it . the gig s up .
that is it .
i would like this cashed , please .
what ? no . use the bathroom on the plane !
jake . you can call me jake . here and there .
here and there , scooter ? here and there like boston , chicago , houston ? the bay area ? some action in london , til it turned nickel and dime . or how about that little stint down in miami ? heard you actually got into some trouble with the feds down there . you guy s pretty good ?
i have a good crew .
minus one .
you know , back in the day , grafting was considered a gentlemangs racket . good suits , good food . . . the underworld of the underworld . a grifter had to survive on his wits , his instincts . . . i like that . i like the idea of that . these days , things being what they are , guys like me gotta stay low . it is all take , take , take . you cannot just be fucking witty about it .
i guess it lacks a certain style .
of course , your line of work s only as good as the people you find .
you cannot cheat an honest man .
you cannot cheat an honest man . but a man like lionel dolby . . .
i apologize for the inconvenience .
i cannot do that .
why not ?
let me rephrase i will not do that .
let me repeat why not ?
because you killed one of my crew .
buddy , that was business . besides , you have more crew . then there s you . . .
i will get the money back , plus interest . i go on the grift for you . you get a cat , i get a cut . and we get square .
fucking grifters ! i love it ! you got balls , i will give you that much .
no . just confidence .
we got caught . so you know it will not happen again .
you ask a lot of questions . come on . let me see em .
i think two million .
what do you need from me ? permission ? go ! if you can fleece him for two million , then do it , kid .
i need you to stake me .
stake you ?
i need you to stake me . i cannot do it without it . it is just a couple hundred grand . taken out of our cut when we are done .
nothing ventured , nothing gained .
hey skippy ? do i have the word chump tattooed on my forehead ?
no , you listen . we are partners now and even though i am running the show for you , i am still running the show . that means i get a little respect . so i do not want to hear anymore of this scooter , buddy , junior , skippy , tiger , bullshit . it is jake . and i gotta tell you , for a guy who spends all his time in a gym , you could be in better shape .
i said take off your fucking shirt .
you are not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything , are you ?
no thanks . i am good .
come here !
i think i just broke my hand .
harder . remember , i killed your buddy .
yeah well , sobo s kid needs braces .
all the shit we pulled with you and you are trying to shake us down ? you guys got sack .
was that a threat ? did i hear a threat ? last i remember , we were talking economics , then this . . . ? what happens next time if we gotta stop and help a little old lady cross the street ? well , shit . . . then we gotta pass the call to someone else .
tip was fine , jake . we were a little more curious about the fed .
hey , listen . . . if you guys do not pay your taxes , that is your business .
gunther ? i think i would remember a gunther .
ring it for him , sobo .
well he is in town and he sure as shit remembers you . what are we going to do about this jake ? we cannot afford to have a fed onto us .
would not dream of it .
something stupid .
good boy .
do not worry about moonan . we got him covered . when . . . ? it was him . there s a shipment coming through tonight . kennedy .
jake . jake pearson . i go to lawschool with your daughter . carolyn . we met once or twice .
well , it certainly is a coincidence . here of all places ! how is mrs . lewis ?
great . thank you .
my wife and i are just taking a little vacation .
thank you . actually , it is our first anniversary this weekend . she thinks i am here to pick up something for my mother , but it is actually a gift for her . think i have fooled her ?
take it from me , you never do . but congratulations . nice to be married , is not it ?
very much so .
sure .
y y you fucking shot him ! that is what happened !
i had to ! that motherfucker was about to welch ! you saw what he was doing , right ? you heard him !
listen to me ! it went to shit . it happens sometimes .
listen to me ! we do not have much time . we can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me !
help me .
what about this situation makes you think i can answer that question right now ?
we are not cops .
you interested in a little work ?
take a deep breath and count to ten . it is not that kind of work . you are lily , right ?
says who ?
you are working daffy s block . he was going to break your kneecaps . pick pockets can be so bitchy sometimes . i told him you were with us , so that is two you owe me .
oooh . sassy . what do you care who feels me up , jake ? unless it kinda gotcha going . did it , jake ? getcha going ?
gee thanks . now i do not have to find that bridge to jump off .
here s my deal do not waste my time . what do you want me for anyway ? you do not even know me .
i just have a good feeling about you . have not you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before ?
you get an equal cut .
what do i have to do ?
just play a part . a little acting .
i will worry about customs .
hey , i am not just along for the ride , so i do not want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut .
take a deep breath . you sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something .
hey , i got it ! take some mental notes . you just might learn something here .
do not worry about it .
it is just that i left my asshole decoder ring at home , so how do i know not to worry ?
what ?
and some new clothes .
why ?
we are going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy , if not be classy . you gotta do this thing and i do not even know if you can .
you are just going to have to trust me .
i do not trust anyone .
then show me how .
honey , this is mr . lewis . carolyn lewis s father . mr . lewis , this is my wife , lily .
uh huh .
i gotta go get a haircut .
uh huh .
lighten up .
but the fucking grand poo bah of all jinxes ? a bird in your house . . .
what about this ? do you have any idea what this means ? you have killed us . we are dead !
did i miss something ?
off the record , i am this close to cutting someone in on the action if it would help .
for what ? a couple hundred bucks ?
i think you would do it for free . you are almost drooling . you like the rush .
it is what i do . it is my job .
why ? your mother not breast feed you or something ?
are you asking me if i have something to prove ?
do you have something to prove ?
not in that repressed anger sort of way .
i am your basic underachiever . cannot stand working and porn does not seem like a good option .
good quality porn has it is place in the world .
whatever . but you . . . i get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything . so why this ?
i am good at it . lying , cheating , manipulating . . . i am good at it .
it is more than that .
intuition . it does not make you yoda . like tonight . you killed that guy tonight . but i knew you would .
so that was my part ? smile and shake my ass ?
no . you have another part ? you will know what to do .
how do you know i will ?
intuition .
do not ruin this for me .
what ?
i said , how do deal with that ?
sounds respectable .
not the way i did it . i was loaded half the time . i do not know how you could change bedpans sober . i used to hang out with this guy , glenn . he was an x ray technician or something .
you want to talk about an old boyfriend right now ?
yeah , the sensitive guy thing never worked for me .
we were friends . i trusted him . i should have known it was weird . but , then again i was weird .
you guys got busted . this is a great neck .
glenn talked you out of it .
sort of . i was telling him about this great love of my life who s name i do not remember , and i could see . . . he was getting pissed . i thought it was just because he was worried about me , but . . . he told me that i was stupid because my boyfriend did not really love me .
then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor , that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off . he said he was going to fuck some sense into me .
lily . . . jesus christ . . .
after glenn was finished , he gave me a couple of valiums and i went home . the next day , i finished my shift and met him around back , like we always did . i stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest . three or four times .
i do not know . i packed up my shit and ran away . to this . . . so unlike you , i guess i do have something to prove , in a repressed anger sort of way .
you know why i told you that , jake ? because i trust you too .
no , i am not going to take it easy . you cannot stay clear of this guy . he will be on this until the end of time .
hey , we fucked once , honey . that hardly makes you a good judge of character . and do not think i did not know you were working some angle with that either .
everyone s working an angle , right ?
there are three people i trust him , him and a guy who got killed . i do not know who you are ! you are like some stray dog that wandered into the house . so i am telling you to cut loose of this . no one s looking for you , not the king , not moonan and not gillette . just go wherever it is you would go . it is over .
what about what ?
what about the money ?
no , i want my cut !
i am going to say this one last time for you , so take a deep breath and count to ten . there is no cut .
your friend , big al ? it should have been you .
it is me . it is jake . listen . . . it is happening . gordo s landing right now . meet me at the euclid . . . for your cut , i mean . it is . . . i want you to have it .
you sold me out . you should have trusted me like i trusted you . you fucked up . you fucked up huge .
what do you want ? an apology ?
no , i want my cut !
if you wanna help , then help . if not , shut up .
your mess .
then shut up .
my place .
you sure we are clear ?
you better get over to al s . now .
miles . . .
sorry . i am just . . . look what they did to him . right in the middle of his egg foo young .
just an idea , but let s just fucking split . we will meet up anywhere . akron or austin or atlanta . anywhere . . .
he will find us . we go talk to him .
just mail it to the hospital . mr . king , please . it is regarding an accounting problem . yes . . . correct . . . i know where it is . that will be fine . thank you .
how do you know the king s going to let you walk ?
i am getting a ride .
now you are an accomplice in a homicide . everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg .
wait a second . . . who s the mope ?
what do we need another shill for ?
breasts .
because that is who the king pin wants us to fleece . and gillette s perfect . . .
what ?
i am just thinking out loud here , but . . . two million in a briefcase ?
good point .
yeah , or d , it is a dumb fucking idea . . .
then what do you want to do , miles ? run ?
we never had a problem with that before .
yeah , well we never had this kind of problem before .
what are you talking about ? yes we have . and we would have been beautiful about it . we would have had a bucket of chicken delivered to the king with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it . then we woulda moved on til the next local putz caught on .
we are getting a little old for running .
yeah , well we are still a little young for albany state prison . are you pissed about al ? i am pissed too , but i am not like twenty five to life pissed .
i am getting clear of this . if you are not going to do it for the fucking principle , do it for the money . gordo ?
no , the corporate papers have to be legit . but you gotta score an i . d . a clean one . talk to suits . i gotta get us a banker .
michelle strigo . loan officer .
you sure ?
where the hell is she ?
but the best part was that he could not find gordo ! he was in the bathroom . so he finally goes in there , kicks in a stall door and starts yelling ! and there s gordo , pants at the ankles , holding a pc world magazine !
there is no scam ! i have got a fucking sign on my back ! i cannot leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money . you get it ? it is over . we walk .
escorts !
do you even remember al ? do you remember what he looked like sitting there ?
and we got rid of the red head .
jake ? customs ?
do you have a ticket ?
you know , this is kind of embarrassing , but my wallet was stolen yesterday and i am afraid the ticket was in it . but the name s pearson .
you are sure ? this is . . . just a complete disaster .
what was it ?
that is no problem . we have those in stock .
thank you . sorry , i am just a little anxious to give it to her . you take out of state checks ?
with identification .
i am sorry .
i am sorry .
this is embarrassing .
you going to have the time ?
i will find the time .
do not worry , i will settle up with your boss . we have not skipped town yet .
what i am saying is , is that the king ai not gonna care . see he had a real thing with getting this gillette guy , if you ask me i think he is jealous .
of what ? they are both crooks .
exactly . cept this gillette guy . he gets to walk around in three piece suits , hob knob with the mayor , own a bank , that kinda shit . meanwhile , the king sits holed up in the steam , afraid to even take a leak without me or harlin watching the door .
my fucking heart bleeds .
your buddy . that fat guy . the king could not wait to have that guy whacked . he did not even know who the guy was , but he was so pissed off at him , he gets him drilled . it ai not personal . it is business .
point , lupus . give us a point .
point is , you do not go through with this , he is going to go after you next . and he do not even like you , jake .
oh , you know . . . do not fuck this up . i will kill you . i will kill your family . i will shoot your dog . . . all the usual . then he said good luck .
let me ask you something . . . you really think i am going to come this close , this fucking close and let my guard down ? i will get square with your boss . i will get square with whoever did al . i will get square with everybody . then i am going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here .
you are a weasel .
maybe he is got it right . maybe we are all just looking for a safe place to shit .
that was fucking deep .
keep it up .
that is what i like about you , lupus . you are a free thinker . do not let the king tell you different .
what ?
stand up .
no offense , but i have seen you fight . you gotta be kidding m
eee oott auught !
sorry . what ?
he got caught ! your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched !
you were right . he is trying to fuck you . you want it , you gotta get it at the airport . . .
not easy pickings . papers like these speak to larger issues . sorry about alfonse . you into something big ?
pretty much .
in over your head ?
pretty much .
huh ? oh . she is alright .
a little bit of both .
i saw you go up from the knecker , working that grind , learning the barnard s law and i thought , the kid s a prodigy . but i know that if you are using these goods . . . so then i figure , that is worth that ? you are either looking for a little history or a retirement fund . who s the mark ?
cannot say .
then who s the banker ?
the king .
i can handle it .
i do not doubt your talent . you looking for that place in the hall of fame ?
it is not history .
so what do you want ?
i want to get out from under all this for good . and i want to fuck them all doing it .
then i gotta say , in my opinion , you cannot get what you want .
cannot do it suits . i cannot lay down for this one .
okay . here s the thing . . . you fall flat , you might not get anything short of stiffed . then it is blue river land for everybody . papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply , then they start to take shape . usually it is the shape of an arrow . i hate to do it , but after this , i gotta give you the blowoff . we jake , jake ?
you guys got sack , i will give you that much .
confidence . it is just confidence .
we got a good thing going here . you want to blow it over an overbite ?
i try .
what are we gonna do with this stuff anyway ? heroin ? what the hell do you do with heroin ?
consider him part of your crew . consider him a part of me .
a fed ? is he close ?
i do not think so . their fix gave us the heads up and jake s got a plan that will probably keep him off .
he is landing . he is got a suitcase on wheels .
so do half the other people in this place . how do i know which one ?
i got it figured out . . . he is got this thing with bathrooms . if he makes it through customs , he will be heading for the john .
good . good . do not let vig out of your sight .
you are officer richard rottovich . and this would be officer walter sobozinski . i am looking for jake vig .
look special agent moonan . . . we do not know what you are talking about .
i want him for something big and to do that , we have to catch him in the act .
look , i am not a confrontational person by nature .
i think so . what would he ever do to you anyway ?
let s just say he burned me once .
we are here .
i have been looking for this jake vig for some time now . problem is , the guy s the invisible man . a spook , a spectre , a ghost . then , like a gift , jake s good buddy and member of his crew , alfonse moorely , is found the other day with a hole in his head .
what do you want ?
you help me catch him . whatever he is into next , i want you to be into . and what you are into , i am into . if it all goes well , those two guys from iad will never have to hear this tape . i will clear you guys of anything you have ever done with vig under the guise of some cross departmental investigation . this prick s been on the wish list for so long , you will probably get gold shields out of it .
what do you get out of it ?
peace of mind .
that is it ?
not everyone s on the take , walter .
literally . it is not a bad deal , gentleman . i get peace of mind . you get detective sheilds . but this is the best part , walter . . . walter , your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile . capice ?
whaddya mean ? we got dick .
you guy s are not working with me here . i just got off the phone with my boss . after he got done ripping me a new lincoln tunnel size asshole , he let me know exactly how little i am welcome back if we come up short . and now here you guys are , wasting my fucking time !
roger that .
to who ?
do not be an idiot . how hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer s drugs to another drug dealer ? if vig s right , we might be looking at a hundred , maybe a hundred fifty grand . . .
you think this is a good idea ? we never did this kinda shit before .
that is he going to do ? file a missing drugs report ? if it works out , this guy might be good for a few more turns .
it is cosmetic . they do not cover cosmetic . last year i had a tooth capped . the dentist tells me i am not covered for caps . it is cosmetic .
whoa , whoa . . . there he is .
i do not trust anybody . you see how bad this guy wants vig ? it is like a sickness . i say we collar vig ourselves . we got vig , then we got leverage . and we trade vig for that tape . i want to see it right in front of my face .
it is just insurance .
that is what i am talking about .
i am down !
high five .
put your hand down . i do not high five .
jack manfred .
hi , jack . welcome to the cesspit .
is it that bad ?
how do i look ?
no . thanks .
my car s in the garage .
maybe another time .
i will take you up on that .
goodnight .
it is the tension .
all men are cheats .
why did you quit ?
i got scared .
i can imagine .
can you ? i am happy being a dealer . at least the punters keep their hands to themselves .
you called the casino a cesspit .
well it is . but i know where i am .
i despise the job .
ah , we all say that . but if we hate it , why do we do it ?
look , now i am pumping you . i am sorry . it is none of my business . it is just that you are not like the others .
not like matt , you mean .
now he is a real shit . do not get friendly with him . i am sure he is got his hand in the till . you know what he said to me once ? i want to fuck the whole world over . that is my mission . the shit !
sorry .
what are you talking about ?
i do not know anything about it .
look bella , i do not know anything about this . you should talk to matt .
you are all scumbags .
a couple i know are getting married .
that is the blue book price ?
that is not relevant . an old car like this , it depends on the condition .
how about five hundred .
what ? !
how about we split the diff . . . seven fifty .
is that your idea of arithmetic ?
i am not a mathematician . i am in business .
eight fifty .
seven fifty .
what a memory you have got . maths always was your strong suit . what happened to the moaning lisa ?
she went back to south africa .
did she ? you were pretty thick at one time .
we all played the field .
i want a job , giles .
all right . as what ?
i was thinking perhaps i could be a reader . you employ readers , do not you ?
we do . for unsolicited manuscripts . we pay twenty pounds a manuscript . you might get two , maybe three in a week . can you live on sixty pounds ?
i am working on that soccer story .
right . look , i must get back to habib .
habib ?
my author . he is a terrorist . he is written a kill and tell book . take care .
i will try and make it .
looking forward !
south african women are very sporty .
who was he ?
she .
do not be a spoilsport . it is only a few quid .
it is nothing to do with money . i do not gamble .
hey . i have got an idea . why do not we . . .
get what ? are you accusing me of cheating ?
good god , no . but with skill like that , what do you want a job for ? you do not need to work .
not particularly .
and your lady ?
she had to leave early . she asked me to thank you .
a bit unexpected , was not it ?
not entirely .
how is that football story corning along ?
you said it was going to be social , giles . no business .
you mean i will not resist them .
you want me drunk ?
i will not be that long .
it is not just inner beauty , is it ?
turn around .
i . sold the car .
you should not have done that . i know what it meant to you .
i owe you for the rent . it is only a car . i can get another .
take it back . till you sell your book .
come on , marion . let s face the truth . nobody s going to publish it .
of course they will . you just have to be patient . i am betting on you .
i have got something to tell you .
i want to hear it .
i have got a job .
what job ?
how did you land that ?
it came my way . a week .
? what did you do , just walked in and said i want to be a croupier ? do not you need training ?
i had training . in the republic .
you were a croupier there ? you never told me that . i thought you just knew some gamblers .
i start monday week .
there s no third thing . do not be superstitious .
i love you jack , you know that .
you have got such beautiful hands .
i do not know .
fine .
tension . it will go .
poor baby . this will relax you .
it is only hair . i have not changed .
i will see you in my dreams .
do not play the cop with me , marion .
take that back ! fucking take that back . i am not a cop any more .
i take it back . you are not a cop any more . you are a store detective .
are you drunk ?
probably .
this fucking job s getting to you . you have not written a fucking word since you started .
do you have to swear all the time ?
well , that is my poor upbringing . i did not go to no private school . i have not got no class . i want to live with a writer . not a fucking croupier . i do not even know what the word means . croupier .
marion , stop this .
what do i mean to you ? i want to know . tell me .
have not you got a conscience of your own ?
what about a drink on the way home ?
i do not finish till eight . make it nine and you are on .
i am on at nine .
well , that is our life now , is not it ?
why not ?
i do not like it at all . you had a wonderful character before , the gambler . he was so romantic .
he was a loser . this guy s a croupier . he cannot lose . people have shat on him all his life . now he is in control . he is a winner .
is that your idea of a winner ? he does not give a shit about anyone . he uses people and
it is because of the sex , is not it ? you do not like the sex in it .
i do not give a fuck about the sex . most men will fuck a lamppost . he is just a miserable zombie . is that the way you feel now ? is that that is happened to you ?
marion . it is a book .
oh really . then why is he called jake . why do not you come clean and call him jack . there s no hope in it .
it is the truth .
without hope there s no point to anything .
now wait a minute . that is so hopeful about your job ? spending the day catching poor people stealing . you said yourself the organised gangs get away with it . at least in the casino everybody gets caught . rich or poor , the odds are the same . it is all relative .
crap . it is not relative . it is unfair . like your casino . it is designed unfair . and your croupier s a little shit because he goes along with it .
leave it .
no . answer it !
i hope it brings you luck .
it will .
i do not care about her . of course , i was angry . but not with you . the book is yours not mine . i was wrong , what i said about it . i hurt you , did not i ?
you are entitled to your opinion .
it is none of my business what you write . and your job , that is none of my business either . i love you . and i have done everything wrong .
you will ?
within a month . believe me , i am going to quit !
you were talking in your sleep .
not talking . writing .
never . why do you ask ?
i can just imagine , being around so much money all the time . . .
gambling s not about money .
really ?
gambling s about not facing reality . ignoring the odds .
i thought you would not want to spend christmas day alone in here .
there was a message , was not there ?
it is probably easier for you to eat the rice .
marion ! what did you tell the police ?
nothing about you .
then what ?
give up being a croupier , jack . or i will shop you . all you have to do is keep your word . it is that simple .
leave me alone , marion .
you are already alone .
i hate public transport .
what ?
i want to buy a car .
how can anyone be that naive ?
found a job ?
no .
well i have got something for you . in london , i mean . i have been chatting to some friends . do you know the golden lion casino ? it is in bayswater , i believe . . . they are looking for a dealer , a croupier .
it is not that .
i have set this up for you . call the golden lion and ask for mr reynolds , he is the manager . i do not know him personally , but i have spoken to his boss . do not say no , jacko . give yourself a break .
all right , dad . yes , i will call him .
great . i have just started a new company . solid financing . it is good . i love you jacko , you know that
yes , i know that .
do not let yourself down .
i will not . goodbye , dad .
you know where i am from ?
well , thank you anyway .
you know what ? i would like to buy you a drink .
it is against the rules . dealers are forbidden to talk to punters .
that is stupid . what are the odds of you being seen with me ?
impossible to calculate .
there s a casino in this hotel .
i am not much of a gambler really . i just like this bar .
so why did you come to my casino ?
i was at a loose end . a friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership .
first visit to london ?
no , no . i come every couple of years . i always think i am going to stay . i am from cape town originally
i was born in the transkei , on the wild coast .
near the casino .
in the casino .
now there s a coincidence . my father used to gamble there .
your father ?
i loved the atmosphere . but it destroyed my poor mother .
the debts .
and the lies . gamblers are born liars .
and superstitious too . it is like witchcraft .
that is africa . there s an african in all of us , is not there ?
we all came from africa , supposedly .
do you believe in astrology ?
absolutely not . but then , i am a gemini and geminis do not believe in astrology .
absolutely not .
toss you for it .
i do not gamble .
just an accident . nothing .
turn left ahead .
that is fine .
i will watch .
remember the guy who cheated at the table ?
you do not like cheats , do you .
you choose .
it can only work with amateurs , a pro would have spotted it .
i did not .
then you are not a pro .
what kind of trouble ?
i owe a lot of money .
was that why you did the two grand ? i could not help you .
i know that . but you can now .
i do not have any money . switches on the light . jani is looking distressed .
some people i know , they are planning to rob the golden lion .
who s they ?
my creditors . one night , around three in the morning , they will come into the casino
forget it , jani . it will never work .
the point is , they want a man inside .
and i thought you were a bright woman .
just listen . you do not have to do anything criminal .
robbery s not criminal ?
you are serious .
you will not be committing a crime . the man will cheat , you will just be doing your job , that is all .
i have come to know you . you are honest . i trust you .
what will you do when it all goes wrong ?
it will not .
but if it does .
you keep the ten thousand pounds .
what ten thousand pounds ?
reynolds ? you have done your research .
what about my neck ?
i cannot do it , jani .
i am asking you , as a . . . friend . you would be saving the life of a friend .
wait a minute . . .
no , forget it . the bet s off .
let it go .
did they tell you to sleep with me ?
i told you , all bets are off .
what for ?
i have to take the car .
yes .
thank you .
well , life s not fair . we know that .
it is all relative . i need the money too .
do you ?
yes .
the date s not set yet . i will call you . one last thing the man you are going to catch cheating , he may get violent . but you know how to deal with cheats .
that bruise has cleared up nicely .
bruise ? oh , yes . it is better .
i have still got mine .
i took the bandage off yesterday .
no thank you .
it is a shame there are not more men in the world like you .
jack ! it is jani .
sun city . i have been meaning to call you for months .
how are you ?
great . i am getting married . at least , i think i am .
did you solve your problems ?
yes . i am all over that now . jack , hold on a minute . there s someone here who wants to talk to you . . .
who . . .
ross .
who did it ? tell me !
you did ?
i know a cheat when i see one . the man was a cheat .
have i ?
i am lucy .
and what do you do , lucy ?
i am a witch . a white witch . why do not we move on ?
are you going to put a spell on me ?
i might .
too much . eighteen hundred .
turn left at the lights .
over the river .
have you got transport ?
thanks .
nice car .
she is my baby .
how long have you worked at the casino ?
coming up to two years now . but i was away for six months .
you have done pretty well .
not bad . i have other interests , of course .
no thanks , matt . i need my eight hours .
i will lay you five to one you will not sleep . in this job you have to unwind . otherwise it will kill you . i mean that .
some other time .
what the fuck are you talking about ?
that greek guy who won at the end . you paid him out in s not s .
i do not cheat , jack . you have got it wrong .
i am not going to report it .
if i see you do it again , i will report it .
i do not get you . even if it was true , which it is not , what the fuck difference would it make to you ?
because if a supervisor knew i would seen you and i had not reported it , i would lose my job as well . and i cannot afford that .
so it is mr clean . wise up , jack , this whole business is bent . the casino is nothing but legal theft . and that is ok . it is the system . half the punters who come in are using stolen money , drug money , they have not earned it . we earn our money . i am on your side , jack . i do not need an enemy .
you are talking about complicity .
i do not know what that means . i am talking about not rocking the boat .
mostly people in the casino business . a few drug dealers .
and the girls ?
just girls . what are you drinking ?
vodka . straight . on the rocks .
good call . help yourself .
that bitch ? no .
no thanks .
do not worry , i will not report you !
i do not gamble .
loosen up , jack . if you do not , this job will get to you . the pressure s too much , believe me , it will break you .
the world breaks everyone , and afterwards many are strong in the broken places . ernest hemingway .
do not worry .
rough life , jack .
i will tell you later .
i would like to buy you a drink .
cheers . happy new year . i really like you , jacko , you are so fucking straight . hey , you have not changed your clothes !
what are you talking about ? it is , i have won . with this lady .
you have won with the two chips you placed earlier , but the third chip was a late bet .
i put them on together .
i am afraid that is not so , sir .
wait a minute . you got yourself barred .
it was you , you shit .
jack .
has he ?
in any case , i understand you have had some previous experience . . . in south africa . you will find the rules a little different here . before we start , you have not got a police record , have you ?
no .
i was at beadles .
i do not think i know that one . private , i suppose .
do you have a salon prive ?
we tried . but there was not enough business . the punters like company .
we check every four days .
why four ? and not three or five ?
it is the procedure here . now sort the chips .
any exceptions ?
pounds or pence in fours .
give me .
we do .
where is the magnet ?
they have been tested .
i do not think so .
wipe your hands .
what happens if i want to sneeze ?
you will not . not without permission .
five .
i make it six .
five .
it is a rule . always stand by your first count . the odds are you are right .
good call .
i said good call .
what for ?
for the database . it can be accessed by every casino in the country . we have the same system for punters .
i do not gamble .
ever ?
i do not gamble , mr reynolds .
we had the same rule at sun city , but it was impossible to check .
this is not south africa . we would know , because someone would report it . believe me , someone always does .
does know ? or does report ? what would happen if i knew something like that and did not report it ?
we would know . there are no secrets in this casino . you would be punished .
how ?
first offence verbal warning . second offence written warning . that one s filed and sometimes copied to the gaming board . my discretion . third offence you are sacked on the spot . you would never work in a casino in this country again . there s another rule you are forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino . if you see someone who s gambled here , even if it is just casually on the street , you must ignore him . or her . you are not married , are you ?
yes .
she is not in the gaming business is she ?
no .
very impressive .
we have tapes in here that go back six months . let me show you something .
fine .
that hair will have to go .
fine .
jack , you are not the usual type we get here .
all right , mr reynolds .
does he win ?
he is a good customer .
i can see .
a pleasure . pity about bella .
she was a real asset . but what could i do ?
bruised .
take your time . two weeks . three if you need it . we will pay you sick leave . i do not want to lose you . you are a good man . here . . .
right , that checks out here .
i read that with a quantum increase of seven .
what flickering light ?
the one on unit . . . oh , i think it is gmr twelve zero zero .
oh . that is wrong now ?
i am not sure . i think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship , though .
i hope it is not the oven again .
yeah .
remember when the artificial gravity , went out in the toilet ?
eventual supernova .
look , bomb . . .
i think he is talking to it .
key ? key ? what is the key ?
no , no , the key , the key to the fail safe lock !
key ?
where is the fail safe key ?
the key !
where is it ? what did you do with it ?
i do not have it . i do not know where it is .
you must have it , you idiot , we can stop the bomb !
christ , twenty seconds , christ !
where is the key ?
we are gonna die , boiler . we are gonna die .
oh , god . . .
it did not go off .
boiler , we are alive . my heart .
doolittle , are you there ?
it is talby . he is drifting away from the ship without his jetpack .
yoo hoo , bomb . . .
time to start talking .
not much . nothing at all in this sector .
find me something , i do not care where it is .
well , i show a probability of sentient life in the horsehead nebula . . .
fuck that shit .
well , it is kind of a long shot . . .
it is a goddamn wild goose chase . remember when commander powell found that plus probability of sentient life in the magellanic cloud ?
well , there s the possibility of . . .
remember what we found ? fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it . remember ?
all right , then . . .
so do not give me any of that sentient life crap . find me something i can blow up .
sounds good . chart a course for the veil nebula .
pinback , throw me the chart log .
he just likes it up in the dome , that is all .
i read the same here .
open quantum latches
can you beat that ? i always knew talby was weird .
talby , can you read me ?
energy shielding positive function .
swell . let s synchronize detonation time . do you know when you are supposed to go off ?
detonation in six minutes , twenty seconds .
all right , i have detonation time at . . . wait a minute , something s wrong with the clock . all right , i have detonation time at . . . no , that cannot be right , it says three years . okay , i have six minutes exactly . does that check out down there ?
check at six minutes .
arm yourself , bomb .
well , then , everything sounds fine . we will drop you off in thirty five seconds . good luck .
thanks .
begin main sequence . mark at drop .
bomb to sergeant pinback . roger , i read you , continue .
energy shielding positive function .
do you remember the detonation time ?
detonation in twenty minutes .
right , that synchronizes here . okay , bomb , arm yourself .
armed .
thanks .
i am programmed to detonate in nine minutes . detonation will occur at the programmed time .
you will not consider another course of action , for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you ?
no .
huh ?
therefore , i shall ignore you .
hello , bomb .
false data can act only as a distraction . therefore . i shall refuse to perceive you .
hey , bomb .
the only thing which exists is myself .
bomb ?
in the beginning there was darkness , and the darkness was without form and void .
and i saw that i was alone .
i am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds . detonation will occur at the programmed time .
bomb , this is doolittle . you are not to detonate , repeat , you are not to detonate in the bomb bay . disarm yourself . this is an order .
i read you , lieutenant doolittle , but i am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes . detonation will occur at the programmed time .
of course .
are you willing to entertain a few concepts ?
i am always receptive to suggestions .
fine . think about this one , then how do you know you exist ?
but how do you know you exist ?
it is intuitively obvious .
intuition is no proof . what concrete evidence do you have of your own existence ?
hmm . . . well , i think , therefore i am .
that is good . very good . now then , how do you know that anything else exists ?
my sensory apparatus reveals it to me .
right !
this is fun .
all right now , here s the big question how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct ?
in other words , all i really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections .
exactly .
why , that would mean . . . i really do not know what the outside universe is like at all , for certain .
that is it .
intriguing . i wish i had more time to discuss this matter .
why do not you have more time ?
because i must detonate in seventy five seconds .
to explode , of course .
and you can only do it once , right ?
that is correct .
and you would not want to explode on the basis of false data , would you ?
of course not .
well then , you have already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe .
yes , well . . .
so you have no absolute proof that sergeant pinback ordered you to detonate .
i recall distinctly the detonation order . my memory is good on matters like these .
yes , of course you remember it , but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality .
true , but since this is so , i have no proof that you are really telling me all this .
hmmm . . .
so if you detonate in . . .
. . . nine seconds . . .
. . . you may be doing so on the basis of false data .
i have no proof that it was false data .
you have no proof that it was correct data .
mafhkin oble groop . . .
ah , what was that again , i still cannot hear you ?
i said i am trying to reach talby . something s wrong with the damn intercom . i need a last minute diameter approximation .
i will check it .
yes , doolittle .
your ghf reading is minus fifteen .
doolittle . . .
yes .
i need a computer reading on a fail safe mark .
in a second .
boiler , can you set me up with some temp figures ?
which one ?
another unknown . not on the charts . a red dwarf .
any planets ?
yeah . eight , it says here .
any of em any good ?
naah . all stable .
what ?
the new star . what are you gonna name it ?
who cares . do not bother me .
commander powell is dead .
fred .
wha ?
i hereby name this star fred .
out where ?
veil nebula .
who cares ?
ah , negative drop .
remove thrust drive repellant
automatic channels open
remark .
drop , drop , drop !
oh , sure .
yeah , doolittle . that is up ?
talby was in the air lock . you blew him out of the ship . i am going after him . turn on his helmet radio so i can contact him .
oh ! ah , yes , doolittle . what is it ?
okay , doolittle , i will have it in a minute .
i like it up here .
must get lonely being up here so much .
i do not like to go below since commander powell died . i feel enclosed down there . if it were big enough , i would sleep up here . . .
. . . should spend some time below , see more of the rest of the ship . . .
. . . you see , i can watch things up here , doolittle . i love to watch things , just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids , gas clusters . . .
you will have plenty of time for that , you know . figure it this way twenty years in space and we have only aged three , so there will be plenty of time to stare around . . .
you know , doollttle , if we are going into the veil nebula , we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing the phoenix asteroids . they should be passing through there about now . . .
phoenix asteroids ? never heard of em .
they are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every . trillion years . the phoenix asteroids . . . from what i have heard , doolittle , they glow . . . glow with all the colors of the rainbow . nobody knows why . they just glow as they drift around the universe . imagine all the sights they have seen in the time they have been travelling the birth and death of stars , things we will never see . the universe is alive , doolittle . i thought it was all empty , but it is not . in between the stars , it is seething with light and gasses and dust . there are little pebbles drifting around , planets no one on earth has ever seen . . . no one but the phoenix asteroids . . .
i am getting something here , on this readout . . .
it is funny , but i kind of sit around , you know , a lot of time to myself . . .
i think i am getting a malfunction here somewhere .
i cannot talk to the others , but with time to myself , i think about back home , back home at malibu . i used to surf a lot , talby . i used to be a great surfer .
lieutenant doolittle , i am getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed circuit computer systems . . .
the waves at malibu and zuma were fantastic in the springs talby . i can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit . . .
i cannot seem to locate the malfunction exactly . . .
waves would be peaking really high and glassy . hit that water . riding the wall just perfect .
. . . somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits . . .
i guess i miss the waves and my board most of all .
do not worry about it . we will find out when it goes bad .
i really think i should try and locate it immediately . might be something important .
i wish i had my board with me now . even if i could only polish it once in awhile .
yes , talby , what is it ?
sorry to interrupt your lunch , sir , but i am in the computer room , and i think i have located the malfunction . the scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser , down by the emergency air lock . cannot pinpoint it exactly , but i am going down there with a starsuit and try to find it .
sounds good , talby . let me know if anything important comes up .
sh , talby , do not bother me now .
ah , well , i think i have found the malfunction , sir . i am in the emergency air lock . . .
not now !
well , i am in the emergency air lock and
calm down , talby . i am coming .
here i am . i think i am spinning . . . we are both falling , talby , in opposite directions , away from each other . my my jetpack s gone .
what happened , doolittle ?
bomb must have gone off inside the ship . nothing we can do about it now . hey , it looks like . . . the skipper . he made it . commander powell made it !
when you fall , doolittle , if there s anyone down there on the planet , somebody may see you . they may see you coming down . what a beautiful way to die . . . as a falling star . . .
guess you are right .
doolittle . . . i think it is the phoenix asteroids !
phoenix ?
no kidding ?
i am going into them , i am going to hit them . doolittle . . .
yeah ?
before we get too far away , and our signals start to fade , i just wanted to tell you . . . you were my favorite . i really liked you , doolittle .
i really liked you too , talby . hey , some debris from the ship ! it is coming right by me .
i am glad you have come to talk with me , doolittle . it is been so long since anyone has come to talk with me .
commander , sir , we have a big problem . you see , the veil nebula bomb , bomb number , is stuck . it will not drop from the bomb bay . it refuses to listen and plans to detonate in less than eleven minutes .
doolittle , you must tell me one thing .
that is that , sir ?
tell me , doolittle , how are the dodgers doing ?
well , sir , the dodgers broke up , disbanded over thirteen years ago .
ah . . . pity , pity . . .
you do not understand , sir , we cannot get the bomb to drop .
ah , so many malfunctions . . . why do not you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me ? oh , well , did you try the azimuth clutch ?
yes sir . negative effect .
what was that , doolittle ?
negative effect .
it did not work ?
that is correct , sir .
sorry , doolittle . i have forgotten so much since i have been in here . so much .
what should we do , sir ? the time is running out .
well , what you might try is
doolittle , hello ?
sorry , sir , you faded out there for a minute .
sorry .
what were you saying , commander , about the bomb ?
ah . . . it seems to me , doolittle . . . sorry , i have drawn a blank . hold it . i will have it again in a minute . i forget so many things in here , so many things . hold on , just a minute , let me think . . .
oh , yes , doolittle , i am thinking .
we are running out of time , sir .
oh , yes . . . well , doolittle , if you cannot get it to drop you will have to talk to it .
sir ?
talk to the bomb .
i already have , sir , and pinback is talking to it now .
no , no , doolittle , you talk to it . teach it phenomenology , doolittle .
sir ?
phenomenology . . .
yeah , the skipper always was lucky .
bruno s girlfriend .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
but see tonight wives and girlfriends are not invited .
no ?
no . . . cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity . all of them work for me , and you do not . . . let s go .
how i make my living , that is your point ?
this .
i am on a break .
guess again .
now that that is out of the way . . . you want the woman , here s how it works . you pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever , and i make a call to bring her in .
or we could go another way cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is .
yeah , sure , i understand .
yeah ?
sooo . . . whattya think ? maybe after i betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them . . . we could go on a date . play a little miniature golf or something .
i like to keep it professional , that is all .
actually , that is not gonna be necessary .
what ?
that is not why we are here .
what the hell are you talking about ? call her .
you have not figured this out yet , have you ? you walk in here thinking you are gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging . . . but see it is really the other way around . you think i am the whack , when actually you are the whack .
you are in the last two seconds , you do not cut the crap .
what are you talking about ?
i am hired to do a piece of work , my mark goes down and stays down . your s makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job . only the cops got the whole thing on video tape .
that is a lotta crap .
security camera got you coming outta the stairwell , weapon in your hand , going to room one oh four and greasing the patient . it is embarrassing to the professional community , is what it is .
how come i never hearda you before ?
i am outta portland . sonrisa did not want local talent .
but the boss knows i always been loyal .
he is got exposure . he sees you staring at fifteen to life , there s a chance you could roll over , cop a plea , who knows ? mangs figured the odds . . . and he cannot take a chance .
what the hell are you doing ?
who s camille ?
none of your business .
this will not hurt . triple dose of insulin , you will go into a coma , couple minutes you will stop breathing and on a busy night , the coroner will probably mistake it for an o . d . plus , it is way classier than blowing your brains out .
you did not tell me you lived with her .
you know each other ?
leave . now .
can i say something in my defense ?
no .
where ?
you mean until you showed up ?
you are not still pissed ?
justine was not an unwilling participant .
she was there . . .
trying to have a relationship with you , max , is like standing in a fog bank . you know you are in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are .
and when the fog lifted , there s darren with his head under justine s skirt .
could you give us a moment .
it was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued , causing you to maybe take offense .
i am really glad we are having this conversation . you are right . i was angry at you . but talking about it the scales have fallen from my eyes and i see now that it was all my fault . can you ever forgive me ?
i see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact . . . at least i tried .
i live here . . . guess i do not have to ask what you are doing here .
you are roommates ?
police drone .
what ? where are we going ?
no time .
no way .
unless you wanna end up in jail , let me and kendra handle the cops .
do not look down .
so you just decided to return it to the sender . or , in this case , the sender s wife .
like de prophets say , only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift wrapped underpants to another woman .
it concerns only jah . but , in this case , i was the instrument of the most high .
yeah , well around here , i am the most high . . . from now on , before you do anything , call in for instructions .
theo rode for this place a long time , man .
i did not . it was a present from a guy .
must think you are pretty special laying this on you .
thought so . turned out he wanted me for something else though .
same old story . not interested .
thought i would let you have first crack . . . later .
a grand .
which means i gotta fence it for two . who s got that kinda scrilla lying around , these being the worst of the times .
i ai not mad at you . . .
i will give you seventy five bucks for it .
later .
i do not get involved with guns .
i will make it worth your while .
it is a rule .
am i ?
i got overhead . . .
thanks , it is starting to kick in . i feel almost human .
yeah , me too .
yech . . .
and for all his catting around , not much of a stick man either .
just thought maybe he would like a little coffee with his saliva .
you did not . . .
every week .
shhh ! do not do that !
they took my daughter .
i know .
i could not get to her . it all happened so fast . logan had her , and i saw him fall . . . then peter told me to run . and then he . . . and i remember so clearly , thinking it is me they want . if i run , maybe they will come after me . maybe they will not think about her . . . so i ran . . .
can you help me get her back ?
look , i would really like to . . .
we are not going that route . sonrisa s not someone you make deals with .
what else can we do ?
like i said this is not my regular line of work so i am making it up as i go .
hello . . .
hang on , lauren . we are conferencing in sophy .
i do not want to move away .
i know , honey , but just think how exiting it will be new house , new school , new friends
but why cannot we stay here ?
because we cannot . there s nothing here for us anymore .
are we in some kind of trouble ?
no . . .
then how come last night i heard you talking to logan and you were crying ?
if i am sad , or tired , or sometimes when i am angry or when somebody s being mean to me .
pretty much the same reasons i was crying . but things will be better when we move to a new place .
then i am gonna do what you do to make me feel better when i am sad .
mommy , where are you ?
do not worry , i am coming to get you .
when ?
soon , baby .
mommy , i am scared .
there s nothing to be afraid of . everything s going to be alright .
girl s gotta make a living .
thank god .
first time i ever heard that .
i was expecting someone else .
guess it was not the pizza delivery guy .
you are lucky . i almost pulled the trigger .
we are just a little tense right now . . . it is okay .
whoever that is .
so , what , you liked it because it was shiny ?
no , because it is the egyptian goddess bast .
who is . . .
the goddess who comprehends all goddesses , eye of ra , protector , avenger , and destroyer , giver of life , who lives forever . . . i could keep going .
we did not get a chance to finish our conversation the other night .
logan cale .
can we go somewhere and talk ?
the one you are wearing ?
was not that hard .
am i s posed to be flattered by all the attention ?
now you know who i am , where i live . i figured i better find out who i am dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me .
so now you tracked me down . what d ya think ?
too early to tell .
how does mrs . eyes only like being married to a guy on everybody s hit list ?
laurengs not my wife .
girlfriend ?
one of my sources . her husband was murdered by edgar sonrisa .
that is your shot in all this ? being a famous , anonymous , underground , pirate , cyber journalist cannot be much of a payday .
fortunately , my needs are met in that department .
so , what , you just like the sound of your own voice ?
look around at all this . . . built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life . then the bomb happened and everyone got scared . they blinked and before they knew it they would given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands . overnight the government , the police , everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them .
you miss the good ol days . even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they did not have to . and rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat . those good ol days ?
people had a choice , even if they took it for granted . and now they do not .
so what are you gonna do about it ?
something .
personally , i am more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the trans american building with my pals . instead of giving myself a headache over stuff i cannot do anything about .
you accept the way things are , you are an active participant in making it worse .
is the social studies class over for today ?
yeah . . .
i will not be staying .
i am not a half bad cook .
it was open .
you got a lotta nerve .
me ? you are the one who tried to rip off this piece .
completely different situation . i steal things in order to sell them . for money . it is called commerce . but some stranger sneaking into a girl s bedroom is . . . bent .
bent ?
bent .
you make it sound i pawed through your priceless collection of underwear .
how do i know you did not ?
so saw my hands off , i left you a present .
am i s posed to be grateful ?
that would be appropriate , yes .
how m i s posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo s probably touched everything i own ?
you are that nervous , you are welcome to stay here .
it is alright , peter , we are fine .
we are not fine .
yes on all counts .
i am sorry . it was not my intention . but i had to see you .
you would think a guy who s taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl .
i have not been able to get you off my mind .
you need to get out more .
c mere , i want to show you something .
no , i meant this .
only when i meet someone i have to know everything about .
the other ones ?
the other one like you . . .
you lost me .
c mon , max . first i watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you are rocky the flying squirrel . then , i found this in your apartment .
you did go through my stuff .
he was working on something called project manticore , which was using recombinant dna to produce a superior human . . . a warrior . . . an advanced infantry soldier .
not that i do not enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me ?
the bar code on your neck , max . i know who you are and i know who you are running from .
how well do you remember the lab ?
i remember fine . i just did not understand what was going on . they never told us anything except what to do . it took me a long time afterwards to figure things out .
how much do you know ?
i know they made me . even got the label on my neck to prove it .
the technical term for you is chimera . . .
yeah . . . a made up creature . like in mythology . . . with the head of a lion , the body of a goat and the tail of . . .
a girl .
your basic hodge podge .
hardly . . .
like extra virgin olive oil , the best of the best .
you said you could help .
i need to find this technician , or anyone else who knows about project manticore . they would have used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in vitro work . . . if i can track down one of them .
that is in it for you ?
your help .
i already do not like the sound of this .
the woman you met , lauren . she supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar . the real drug was shipped out of the country . the placebos were distributed to county va hospital and six veterans clinics in the area .
that is low , but this effects me how exactly ?
she is prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of edgar sonrisa s managers . you know who sonrisa is ?
yeah , i catch your hacks . he is satangs lap dog , or something .
so , you know the lengths he will go to keep her from going public . . . i am turning lauren over to canadian law enforcement tomorrow . they will put her in witness protection , but if you are with her the risk of her safety goes way down .
i did not make it this far by attracting a lot of attention .
she is put her life on the line , and her faith in me .
they want me . . . bad . or at least they do not want me grabbed up by the chinese or whoever . best case , i wind up back in that facility . more likely , it is a long drive out in the country , if you know what i mean .
you are a soldier , max . that is what you were put here for . but soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up .
that is deep . but before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one . . . ta ta .
somebody s got to .
not in any pain . . . the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord .
i am sorry .
my mother used to say the universe is right on schedule . everything happens like it is supposed to .
you believe that ?
i have never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen , i just know they do . so the job s to figure out how to deal with the consequences . which you did . . . you took that sonuvabitch out .
well , not me personally .
on accounta you , sonrisa did not get to buy off the jury , or kill the judge . he is gone . once and for all . it was war , max , and you won .
that is what soldiers do , right ?
open it .
i do not know what to say .
deeds , not words . i need your help .
look , thank you for this but
and i feel real bad about all that but it does not mean i need to get involved .
you are involved . by being alive you are involved .
we are quoting mom again .
maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe , sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation . but the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden . was not s posed to , but it did . and it is back to the law of the jungle . you got your predators and you got your victims .
and you still think you can do something to change that .
with your help .
civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes . but logan and max , with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening .
and whether you want to believe it or not , you already fired the first shot . on another matter , federal corrections used to keep records on distinguishing marks scars , tattoos . i did a search and came up with this .
zack . . . he made it . . . he is alive . . .
ladies would be elsewhere .
you do not want to .
but she does work here ?
she may be easy on the eyes but she is trouble , trust me . hot run to two oh two sansomme .
i need to talk to her .
cannot help you .
any idea when she will be back ?
none .
i will wait .
a friend of your fiance s .
what do you want ?
to set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late .
my name s lydia . and it seems you and i have a lot in common .
you said you knew where my fiance was the other night .
with me , where he is been after work , three , sometimes four nights a week for the last two months . . . we have what you might call an intimate relationship .
how do i know you are telling the truth ?
he been sleeping in a t shirt lately ? that is so you will not see the fingernail marks on his back . bet you did not know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting . he did not either . . . at first .
look , i do not know what you want
i thought it was important for you to know the facts .
and so should you . sketchy told me i could expect a visit from you . i know all about how you threatened him . that if he did not break it off with me , you would save him the trouble .
oh ?
well , it is over between you and him . we are getting married next month .
how sweet . standing by your man , even after what he did . you are a very understanding person .
big part of loving someone s being able to forgive them .
you are also a fool .
i think you should go now .
not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch . i decide when i am done with your boyfriend . not him , and certainly not you . unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are .
let go of my hand .
now , here s how it is gonna be , lydia . you are gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails , and you are gonna go home and figure out your marriage , instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do , understand ?
okay , okay .
i understand .
and if i ever catch you coming near my man again . . .
you did .
you drive away business roaring in like that .
yeah , does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got going on here .
you got a punk ass mouth on you , kid .
my name s not kid . it is client . as in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle . now , you got something for me or not ?
right here someplace .
sorry , i was seven at the time .
he got the car in a trade for his old pick up and some food . . . no bill of sale or nothing . it was right after the pulse so all the dmv records were wiped . so we do not get anything on the seller . except i actually managed to find this guy , six hours on the phone . . . say thank you .
thank you .
he says he got it from a woman . does not remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove .
then what ?
then what ? that is it . that is all i got .
nothing on hannah ?
a nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the rockies , and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven , whose last name you do not even know . . . maybe if you could give me something more on her . . . anything you can remember , some detail . . .
only a last name would be nice . or the nearest town to this . . . clinic .
they do not exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar codes on their necks , which is something i am not even going to ask about
you were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks .
nothing so far from arrests , hospital admissions or coroners . this kind of search . . . it is heavy spadework . i am gonna need
more money . . . like i am shocked to hear you say that .
i will live . . . regarding your case . . . i am afraid i have come up with some bad news on your fiance . lemme get the file .
here s your money .
how is this about me ?
they lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery . but there s a bug in my computer keyboard , a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture .
like you said , maybe somebody s tracking one of your investigations .
hardware s too sophisticated . it is gotta be the government . and why do i think they are looking for you ?
you are crazy .
i am you , i take that money and get outta town while you can .
bastard . . .
you and me both .
sure you wanna be having this conversation over the phone ?
just do it . . . five seven five oh eight . . .
got a pencil ?
just give it to me . i will remember .
one seven four nine five natoma .
i am on my way .
caught some son of a bitch stealing my bike . used a car jack to blow out my u lock and bent a bunch of spokes . so now i gotta get my wheels fixed .
at least he did not swing with your ride .
no , but i broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day , know what i am saying ?
straight .
shame , wasting a girl like that on a guy , but what are you gonna do ?
what guys do . nother order .
you are way more philosophical than i could ever be .
i just do not go in with any expectations .
what ?
you are not seriously buying into darrengs nonsense .
no .
he was just trying to blame you cause he is a slut .
yeah .
hell yeah . there s not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying . you are a totally down ass female and a straight up friend who happens to be a little . . .
a little what ?
you know what i am saying .
if i knew what you were saying , i would not be asking .
how long you and me known each other ?
a long time .
long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book , right ?
because you are probably my closest friend in the whole world .
and back at ya . only there s a part of you that is . . . i do not know
a fog bank .
more like a mystery . . . which is not bad . it is just kinduv . . . mysterious . . .
where ?
it is a secret .
yeah , cause maybe he is learned his lesson .
unlikely .
and because he is my friend .
friends do not help other friends cheat .
and because i actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes .
please . . .
they are prisoners to their genes .
so are dogs .
they do not have a lot of moving parts .
only one i can think of .
besides , think of the drama i am sparing natalie .
i say hang the bastard out to dry , let her see him for the heel he is , then maybe she will step to the all girl team and let mama licious ease her pain .
but , of course , there s nothing self serving in that scenario .
i will bet you can . sit .
not right now ? okay , when ?
right after you change your wardrobe , your personality and drop about thirty pounds .
quite a mouth on a girl so young . . . . . . but my guess is talking is not what it does best .
only way you are ever gonna find out is reincarnation . . . fact is , you are gonna pay me , and i am gonna provide you with a service .
i actually know how this works .
you are gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars . . .
what , you gonna put me on your christmas card list ?
pull the cash .
i told her it is just business to you , that all you want is a reasonable solution to this . you give her daughter back , she agrees to leave the country . i play the guarantor , drive her down to mexico tonight , and put her on a train to brazil or wherever .
and she bought that ?
i have sincere eyes .
she is gonna need to know that her little girl s alright .
she is got my word .
she is gonna want to hear for herself .
you get it when i get her .
okay . . . idea . compromise , right ? bruno here comes with me . he holds the money until mommy shows up , then we close escrow . what you do with her after i am gone does not keep me awake nights .
you are the best , maxie .
feel like the dog s dinner .
probably a touch of that is going around .
i know what i got , max . they put me back on that drug they are giving the other vets . only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff s no good .
what if he is on the level ?
here s the dealio on eyes only . he is probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick ass apartment , bored stupid . so he gets off on scaring the poop outta folks like you i gotta go .
tell everybody hey .
you can tell em yourself tomorrow .
later .
i gotta meet natalie for dinner .
right , the big one oh .
but i will take a rain check . . .
we gotta talk .
that is up ?
not half as pissed as she is gonna be when she finds out why i blew her off . . . i need your help , max .
i know what you are thinking . but the truth is , this other person is not someone i am in love with . as a matter of fact , after what she just did , she is not even someone i like much . so in a technical sense , i am not sure you could call me and her cheating . . . officially .
do guys actually believe their lame , self serving excuses ?
max
or do you think we are just so grateful to have one of you idiots we will look the other way , which is arrogant and condescending .
lame , self serving , arrogant . . . guilty as charged .
you left out condescending .
but there s another side
here it comes . the part where the guy turns everything around .
i am the victim here .
really ?
hear me out . this person i have been seeing is a jam pony client who happens to be married
and you were a sympathetic ear .
exactly .
then a sympathetic mouth , then a sympathetic
she had me followed the other day and found out about natalie . now , this persongs demanding i blow her off or she will do it for me by telling nat about us .
does this person have a name ?
lydia .
and lydia telling natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way ?
i am a toy to her .
a toy ?
she is as much as said so . but she does not want to share her toy with anyone else . . . it is just an ego thing with her .
fight fire with fire . threaten to go to her husband .
who either does not care , or could have me killed . either way , natalie s still gonna find out .
what happens if you level with her ?
even if she does not dump me , which is unlikely , she would never be able to trust me again .
and why should she ?
look max , i made a terrible mistake . one i will never , ever make again . natalie and i are soulmates . i know that now . she is the woman i want to spend the rest of my life with . i guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that .
you set up on lydia . when she is on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up . i answer the door and pretend to be natalie .
she tells you how i have been
a philandering pig .
but you explain that you are a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me .
or , i dissolve into an angry , hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again , which is probably what would really happen .
i just do not want natalie to ever find out . she deserves better .
how would you get her out of town ?
convinced her she needed to visit her mom in san mateo .
and we are sure lydia s gonna make her move ?
she came by the apartment once already . fortunately , i would disconnected the doorbell as a precaution . . . lydia s not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh .
i will give it my best shot .
max , what did i do to deserve a friend like you ?
you do not .
easy sketchy .
no , i am serious . that psycho got exactly what she deserved . . . yes .
lydia may not have been one of humanity s finer specimens but
she is toxic . . . monster in bed , but toxic .
you would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she is the villain in the piece . . . you are .
she was the one
none of this would have happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self restraint , which you did not .
true , but
you were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish . and if i ever find out you are going out the back door on natalie again , you are the one who s gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up . understand ?
okay , okay , okay
say the words , i understand .
shut up . . .
i was on call .
i want you on call here .
that is the difference if i am on call here or deployed in the field .
more like deployed in bed asleep .
i do not sleep . . . theo asked me to pick up his check .
and theo cannot pick up his own check because ? . . .
he is sick .
for a change .
how about you do not break my sneakers on this . the guy is seriously not well .
i do not know how to break this to you , normal , we are all looking for another job .
tell him i took the day off cause i was not feeling so hot .
i am taking the rest of the day off cause i am not feeling so hot .
theo s dead .
you are too kind . i am amanda .
right , well , thanks for the drinks and stuff , amanda , but there s no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore .
do not be so glum , hawk . the night s still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities .
huh ?
i would be in a position to spend some money on you if you would get in a position and spend some time on me .
gin .
whoa . some of this hard liquor s a tad too manly for me . i am a brewski man myself .
better ease up then , hawk . would not want to give you whiskey dick would we ?
who s whiskey dick ?
my name s not woody , it is haw haw . . .
believe it or not , you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon to be ex husband . . . the champion of lousy lovemaking . the man who thinks he is the biggest and the best . . . the man who thinks every secretary , stewardess , and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor . the man for whom faking it was invented . christ , if i had not gotten pregnant with our son , i would have never known i even had sex with the prick .
i just told you , he is a big , hairy . . .
no , i mean . . . you love your son ?
more than anything in the world .
and he loves you back , does not he ?
he is a little spoiled , but i know he does .
well , shame on him if he does not .
i am not paying you for the lovemaking , hawk . i just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer .
hawk .
pick a song , hawk .
got any kiss ?
you kidding ? this is detroit . drink ?
yeah , a mangs drink . . .
you mean you never seen a jack daniels on the rocks before ?
save your money , stud muffin . the lady at the end of the bar sends her love .
amanda finch . her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in detroit . play your cards right and you could hit paydirt . she like em young . and since you look a little new at this , let me give you three words of advice . hard to get . think it , act it , know it , be it . nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games .
you are not gonna chicken out on me now , are you ? we have got your kiss song playing and everything .
i i c cannot . . .
look , people undress in public because , a , they are exhibitionists , b , they are nutcases , or c , they need the money . i can tell you are not a , and i hope to hell you are not b . so my suggestion is , think about why you are a c and let your body party , shake your groove thing , boogie oogie oogie till you just cannot boogie no more .
thanks .
it is okay .
yeah ?
believe it .
i do not care . i wanna hear more .
beth , i cannot believe you just said that because that is exactly how i have always felt about you . . . call me jam . it is my band name .
you do not know how long i have been waiting to hear that . . . jam !
right , slow . . .
oh , screw it !
i dunno . i think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther . i am not too up on gene trivia .
your man is the drummer , peter criss , right ?
peter criss is my inspiration , man . if i paid a hundred bucks for a kiss show and all i saw was his solo , i would consider it . . . money . . . hey , how would you know that ?
i have all your notebook doodles memorized , jam . . . here .
my dad s company is relocating him . we are moving . that is why i was acting so freaky in school today . i thought it was the last time i would ever see you . anyway , open the box . i would have given it to you this morning , except . . . like i said , i was freaking out .
nah . once i get my own wheels , i could come up all the time .
that would be great . hey , maybe someday your band will play there . it is a college town , you know ?
let s not think about the past . let s just think about from today on . i will never forget you , jam .
tell me about it . church will never be the same again .
bye .
that is it worth to you ?
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
what ? that is disgusting !
you got in the car , did not you ?
oh , god , how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere .
whatever . . . stella .
yeah .
for once lex is right . it is over . things cannot get any worse from here .
maybe some tunage will chase those blues away .
stan lee could not think of a better one .
our band mystery is a quartet and we cannot go on the road without our drummer . jam s mom said something about sending him to st . bernard s , right ? we gotta bust him out before we go anywhere .
just for the record , i understood the last part of what you said , but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever .
i was just explaining to lex here what you and i already know . just had to make it a little more complicated so he would understand .
totally . all i have had for chow was a packet of pop rocks and a yoo hoo .
that is in sandusky ?
pizza , and i been jones ing for a pizza ever since we left st . bernard s .
disco blows dogs for quarters .
oh , i will remember it till the day i die . his name was . . . simpleton the simian ? no , samson samoan . . . no , simply , similar . . .
really , jam , you trying to make us barf ?
waitaminit , dudes ! i got it ! we find four really small kids , beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets . what do you think ?
brilliance , trip . sheer brilliance . give albert einstein here the nobel prize .
one more time in english .
for the next hour and a half it is every dude for himself . try to get at least one ticket and at p . m . we will meet over there .
plenty , but it was all bad .
stellas . i hate stellas almost as much as i hate dogs .
yo , doofus !
okay , enough . enough . gimme the tickets . i wanna hold onto them .
check !
i have been in love with her since the second grade .
i have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life .
weird . . .
never mind with the too bad shit . i got a crazy plan , but only the craziest among us can pull it off .
so ? your mom s car has a cb , radar detector and cruise control , check ?
we are not stealing my mom s car .
damn straight we are .
hawk , all i need is one ding on the volvo and presto ! there are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from cincinnati .
and when is she due back from that groinecologist s convention anyway ?
sunday , but . . .
then lighten up . she will never know we touched it . alright , here s the plan . we bus it to chez lex , grab the volvo , bail jam the hell outta st . bernard s and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the to detroit .
the hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity ? yeah , i am vaguely familiar
well , jam is in absolute trouble . he could not get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse s ass . you know as well as me he would give his right arm just to see peter criss s drum solo , never mind a whole kiss concert , check ?
curly .
wait a minute . we ditching the rest of school ?
gimme a second , dudes . lemme think .
next stop the to detroit rock city !
lex , am i gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach detroit ? do not worry , these babies are built for speed .
the paint !
now there s a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood .
dudes !
wake up , lex . this is detroit . the cops are not gonna waste city dollars looking for a swedish car . face it , the volvo s on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced , diced , and julienned by christine , the chop shop gourmet .
. . . i mean , my mom s got insurance . that is the worst thing she could do ? ground me for the entire year ? i can handle that . . .
cool , bro , now listen up . . .
. . . holy shit ! i am in absolute trouble ! i never should have let you drive , man ! absolute fucking trouble !
okay , shut the fuck up , lex ! now , then , step number one , we find us a scalper . i got . . . twenty five .
four dudes sneaking in ? we would get busted fer sure . bad plan .
okay , one of us sneaks in , gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience , comes back out , and we all re enter the concerto . voila !
still too risky for my money . we are running out of time here . this is kiss ! a victory for one is a victory for the team . i am sure i can barter with a scalper , but if you dudes think you got better plans , go for it . we will reconvene at that intersection . . .
tickets ?
nah . could not be .
hey , disco dude , it is cool . . .
and if it ai not cleaned off ?
no , i am dumber than a goddamn slug . now can i please clean your windshield and leave without further ado ?
excuse me , i am a little deef a hearing . can you repeat yourself ?
okay . ahem ! you . are . a . dick . with . ears . and . a . really . bad . haircut .
oh , yeah . . . ?
sure .
sorry , man , no can do . but i will be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy .
where the hell am i gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour ?
the easy way .
i cannot just walk in and take my clothes off . it is embarrasskin .
guess you do not want to see the greatest show on earth . and in detroit no less . well , take care , chief .
yeah , you are probably too young anyhow .
hey , i invented fake i . d . s , alright . that is not the problem . . . they are playing disco music in there , man .
chief , here s a little secret . drink heavily , your feet will know what to do . now shit or get off the pot . do you wanna dance or do you wanna see kiss only on their album covers ?
hawk ?
just listen up , man , cause we are in a quandary .
it is my bullworker .
anyway , listen up . they are gone !
that is gone ?
the kiss tickets , you nimrod ! they are just fucking gone ! please tell me you have m !
gone ! ? why would i have the kiss tick . . . ?
just check whatever you were wearing last night . now !
i am really sorry about that , man .
do not be a fembot . so , are you like grounded because of last night , or what ?
of course , but has that ever stopped me before ? besides , my mom s going to some church meeting and will not be back till late . no sweat . . . see you guys in school .
they are what ?
she was standing right over me when i was changing for fuck s sake .
all right . after school we double time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the to detroit rock city .
check .
check .
what ? ! are you mentally deranged , jam ?
well , could not you slow down so i can at least state my case , hawk ? if you do not like it , you can speed up and i will never mention it again .
disco inferno ? disco s infernal morelike .
kind of funny , i thought he would be pissed as hell at me .
guys , guys ! come on , if this is anyone s fault , it is mine . i was the one who grabbed trip s jacket by mistake . it is my fault and i apologize .
please , jam , we are trying to vent some hostility here . sure the whole thing may be your fault , but who s gonna get pissed off at you ?
christine stole it ! asleep , my ass ! the stella booted with your mom s wheels .
jam , not another word out of your femmy ass mouth ! okay , we are here , we got nothing , and we got an hour and a half . we are totally committed . it is time to brainstorm .
uh uh . do not tell us , jam . just show us .
jam , shut up ! you are not allowed to speak , remember ? go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four . i do not wanna hear it .
but . . . my plan involves all four of us acting together .
see you at , jam . later . dudes ? later .
go ahead , jam .
we all beat each other up , then , once we are nice and bruised , we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen . they gotta let us in then .
now !
uhh . . . nothing .
you are going to be late if you do not hurry up and change soon .
change ? that is wrong with what i got on ?
it is dirty laundry for one thing and for another , you still have not worn the clothes i bought you . you are skating on thin ice already , young man , so i would not push my luck . now get out of those rags .
but , mom !
besides , those jeans are so tight i can see your penis .
now do not forget you are on the honor system tonight . i will be home a little after one and if you have been partying or playing that satanic kiss music . . . well , need i remind you of the consequences ?
grounded for the rest of the year ?
you are a smart boy , jeremiah . and so handsome .
you mean , you are sending me to . . . b b boarding school ?
what else can i do ? oh , records and magazines and comic books are one thing , but tickets ? tickets ? jeremiah , do you realize what this means ? that you are no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces ! now you want to see the devil in the flesh . you want to reach out and touch pure evil . . . and in detroit no less !
if i am anything like you , i will deserve him .
what ? !
i said , i am sorry !
if you truly are sorry , son , then you better pray like you have never prayed before . god willed me to find those tickets because he wanted to hear from you . he knows you need help and he wants you to ask him for it .
just keep your lying , heathenous trap shut , jeremiah .
i just lost my virginity in a confessional booth ! lord have mercy ! !
prepare to receive the act of penance . how many sins have you committed since your last confession ?
just one , father , but boy was it a doozy .
that is it ?
yeah .
well , this is a unique confession to say the least , son . and not exactly the most interesting one i have ever heard either . you sure you do not want to talk about . . . oh , carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe . . . or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad s bed ?
no .
well then , i suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing kiss tickets . i realize this is detroit , but i personally find , what that rock and roll band is all about , to be boring as lucifer s kingdom . i will return in a little while .
alright , father , here it is . about two weeks ago i went to my cousings wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if i wanted to take a bath .
no . . .
oh , this is terrible . . . please go on .
well , she was a very tempting siren , father . built like you would not believe . so i gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour .
okay . . . when she peeled off that gown , you will never guess what she was wearing underneath .
was it a teddy ?
a bustier ?
tell you what . you keep guessing and i will say something when you get it .
splendid ! i love a good game of name that nightie .
i had a nightmare once that something like this might happen . i hope he does not get grounded again . if he misses peter criss s drum solo , i do not know if he will be able to handle it .
you are one to talk , lex . your mom s a fucking dyke .
shrooms ! and even if it was lsd , i can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day .
what ?
you know what they say about a big ass . . . big shit .
if your mom so much as smells those tickets , they are history , and we get screwed outta seeing kiss for the third year in a row , the third year !
waitaminit , dudes ! i got it ! maybe we can glue the tickets back together !
wake up , lex ! we just watched jam s mom torch our fucking kiss tickets ! not reo speedwagon ! not journey ! not the bay city rollers ! kiss ! if you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom , i would sure like to hear it !
trip , it is not the end of the world , okay ? quit acting all squeezed out .
smug , trip ! not snug , smug .
we won ? !
yeah ? i have a saying too , lex . it goes , catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us , asshole . we are going this time and that is all there is to it .
simple icity is more like it . and you guys thought jam was in trouble before . wait till mrs . bruce finds out he went to that concert with us .
hello summer detention .
huh . st . bernard s . figures it is named after a canine .
trip , huck that out before it stains the upholstery !
let s lift up her shirt .
fuck you , lex ! this whole thing would not have happened if it was not for you jinxing us . i just made an honest mistake .
i can see that , bright boy . what happened to it ?
damn , she musta hot wired it . we picked up a professional car thief in the shape of olivia newton john !
okay , i am just a little mad now ! jam , why would you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place ! ?
all i got is five . the rest is in the volvo .
a likely story . hand it over , kid .
no really . my brother s hanging onto it for safe keeping . please , let me get him for you .
do not try to run , maggot . chongo s an all state track star in every event .
what do you want ?
a tag on your toe . nobody threatens me and lives .
look , you can have my wallet . . .
it is not nearly enough , punk .
say , chongo , perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the kiss concert our weasly friend will not be attending .
you heard me , nad breath . my time s precious and i think that is a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life .
look , i want to live , but i do not know where the fuck i am gonna find two hundred bucks .
the kiss army !
no , you gimme your gun , boy !
do not tempt me , i will shoot !
not if i shoot first !
i do not even think you have a gun !
neither do i !
hello ? is this me ? i am trip . am i on the air ?
i should hang up on you right now , but you are the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk . what are the names of the four members of kiss ?
gene klein , stanley eisen , paul frehley , and peter . . . criscula ! yeah , that is it !
yeah .
trip ? you just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to kiss live at cobo hall tonight !
yeah , you did !
yeeeehaaawww ! ! this is totally fucking curly , man ! thank you god !
whoa , easy , trip , this is radio , not taxi driver . now listen up cause this next part is crucial . stay on the line so we can get your full name , information , and . . .
good morning . . .
that is all the gusta you can musta ? i said , good morning !
good morning !
now that is better . . . but i still sense some students out there . . . who are afraid . . . just to say good morning !
good morning !
are you afraid ?
good morning !
now that is what i like to hear ! because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears . they give in to their feelings of self doubt . . . they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs , alcohol and premarital sex . empty solutions . these are toxic chemicals . . . and disease spreading behaviour .
horrible accident . my neighbour . . . he got killed .
what happened ?
he got smooshed . by a jet engine .
donnie . donnie darko .
yeah .
did you know him ?
donnie .
i know that this is gonna sound kinda weird . . . but do you know anything about time travel ?
so . . . in order to travel back in time , you would have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light
theoretically .
and be able to find one of these wormholes .
a wormhole with an einstein rosen bridge , which is , theoretically . . . a wormhole in space controlled by man .
so . . . that is it ?
the basic principles of time travel are there . so you have the vessel and the portal . and the vessel can be anything . most likely a spacecraft .
a metal craft of any kind .
well . . . the thing is , nobody remembers their infancy . and anyone who says they do is lying . we think that this would help develop memory earlier in life .
did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness ? that darkness is part of their natural development .
like a spear .
beg pardon ?
like a spear that comes out of your stomach ?
uhh . . . sure . and in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal , in this case the wormhole , or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered .
could these wormholes appear in nature ?
that . . . is highly unlikely . you are talking about an act of god .
if god controls time . . . then all time is pre decided . then every living thing travels along a set path .
i am not following you .
if you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach , you could see into the future . and that is a form of time travel , right ?
you are contradicting yourself , donnie . if we could see our destines manifest themselves visually . . . then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies . the very fact that this choice exists . . . would mean that all pre formed destiny would end .
not if you chose to stay within god s channel . . .
donnie , i am afraid i cannot continue this conversation . i could lose my job .
not until like . . . eighth grade .
when you fall asleep tonight , i am gonna fart in your face .
i am telling mom .
you will put ariel in the garbage disposal .
donnie ! give it back !
i did not say shit .
that is not what i heard . now they think i did it .
well , if you are innocent , then you have nothing to worry about .
you know what ? i think that you did it .
what did you say ?
our saviour . . .
i can do anything i want . . . and so can you . . .
we just want to guide you in the right direction .
who is . . . we ?
you will know soon enough .
where did you come from ?
do you believe in time travel , donnie ?
you have to do something for me first .
you have a request ?
yeah . tell me why you are wearing that stupid bunny suit .
why are you wearing that stupid man suit ?
take it off . i want to see you .
i am so sorry .
why do they call you frank ?
it is the name of my father . . . and his father before me .
how much longer is this gonna last ?
you should already know that . watch the movie , donnie . i have something to show you .
we went to a hotel .
my dad said he found you on the golf course . are you sleepwalking again ?
i do not wanna talk about it .
a hundred and one , i think . every day she does the same thing . but there s never any mail .
go home . go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine .
hey . . .
school s cancelled .
sure .
i am not . but you should check your backpack cause those guys like to steal shit .
fuck them .
yeah . my parents got divorced . my mom has a restraining order against my stepdad . he has . . . emotional problems .
oh , i . . . have those too . what kind of problems does your dad have ?
he stabbed my mom four times in the chest .
he fled . they still cannot find him . my mom and i had to change our names and stuff . i thought gretchen sounded kind of cool .
i am sorry . i was in jail once . i accidentally burned down this house . it was abandoned . i got held back in school again . cannot drive until i am eighteen . i think when i grow up i want to be a painter . or maybe a writer or maybe both . then i will write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book . you know , change things .
donnie darko is a cool name . sounds like a superhero .
what makes you think i am not ?
that is easy . antiseptics .
you mean soap ?
do not knock soap . without it , disease would spread rapidly . if we ran out . . . you and i would never live to see the year .
wonder where we will be then .
the best thing about soap is that it is the only thing on earth that can never get dirty . no matter what crap you throw on it . . . it always rubs off . and there it is again . . . perfect .
until it withers away .
why is that ?
we never would have had this conversation .
i am sorry .
that was a compliment .
will you go with me ?
where are we going ?
no . . . i mean , will you go with me ? that is like . . . what they call it here . going together .
sure .
i am going home .
no . i just wake up and i look around , try to figure out where i am . . . how i got there .
my dad said never wake a sleepwalker . . . because they could drop dead .
so when you sleepwalk , you go somewhere familiar ?
no . every time i wake up somewhere different . sometimes my bike is laying there next to me . like once when i woke up on the edge of this cliff up on carpathian ridge .
and you would never been there before ?
yeah ?
do you ever feel as though there s always someone watching you ?
why ?
well . . . maybe someone is , like . . . giving you these dream steroids . and sleepwalking . . . is someone showing you the way .
i do not want to talk about it . so what happened to your neck ?
why not just buy your baby a night light ?
that is not good enough . you have got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them . . . with whatever you wanted .
with , like , images ?
like . . . a hawaiian sunset . . . the grand canyon . things that remind you how beautiful the world can be .
and what ?
well . . .
you want to kiss me . . .
no . . . donnie , wait . i have never . . .
i always wanted it to be at a time when . . . when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be .
yeah . and right now there s some fat guy over there watching us .
what ?
are you okay ?
i have been seeing stuff . . . a lot of really messed up stuff . do you know who grandma death is ?
who ?
the old crazy woman who lives off old gun road .
she wrote it . there are chapters in this book that describe the stuff i have been seeing . it cannot just be a coincidence . will you come see her with me ?
maybe she is asleep .
infant memory generators .
yeah . so the idea is that . . . you buy these glasses for your infant , and they wear them at night when they sleep .
and inside these glasses are these slide photographs . and each photograph is of something peaceful . . . or beautiful . whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside .
the whole movie . let s go .
that is wrong with you ?
what do you mean ?
not now , donnie . it is not a good time .
then when ? i have to talk to you .
hey . you ok ?
my mom is gone .
where is she ?
i do not know . she did not leave a note . the house is all messed up .
but you are ok ?
yeah , they told me to get out of the house .
it is safe here .
there s something you have to know , gretchen . everything is going to be just fine .
where are we going ?
why ? is this about the book ?
no . frank .
who s frank ?
yeah . . .
just place an x in the appropriate place on the lifeline .
i just do not get this . everything cannot be lumped into two categories . that is too simple .
the lifeline is divided that way .
well , life is not that simple . so what if ling ling kept the cash and returned the wallet ? that has nothing to do with either fear or love .
fear and love are the deepest of human emotions .
well , yeah . . . ok , but you are not listening to me . there are other things that need to be taken into account here . like the whole spectrum of human emotion . you are just lumping everything into these two categories . . . and , like , denying everything else .
if you do not complete the assignment , you will get a zero for the day .
no , a year of partying is enough . she will be going to harvard this fall .
when did you stop taking your medication ?
we will not have this kind of language at the dinner table .
i stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade , mom . get out of my room .
you know . . . it would be nice to look at you some time . . . and see my son . i do not recognise this person today .
then why do not you start taking the goddamn pills ?
that is a terrible nickname .
fine . you know , dr . thurman is not so bad a lady . i can tell her anything .
do you get to meet ed ?
if i am lucky . so . . . i will not be back until the first . your dad will be back on sunday , so i have put elizabeth in charge until then . she has the car . . . so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow .
how does it feel to have a wacko for a son ?
it feels wonderful .
it was great . we had peanut butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime . and then during show and tell , my stuffed walrus was a big hit .
good lord . so the construction guys say it will take about a week to fix the roof . damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match .
do they know yet ?
know what ?
where it came from ?
no . . . apparently they cannot tell us what happened yet . something about a matching serial number that got burned . but i had to sign a form saying i would not talk to anyone about it .
so we are not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows ?
you tell dr . thurman whatever you want .
grandma death .
you know , roberta sparrow . we almost hit her with the car the other day .
i guess she just lost faith in the world .
a lot of people . teachers . younger kids . it is like they are afraid of me for some reason . but that is ok . . . because i know i deserve it .
i know , dad .
i know i am not the best . . . communicator . but whatever happens in your life . . . whatever obstacles you come up against . . . you just say . . . and do whatever is in your heart . you be honest . . . and tell the truth . . . even if they look at you funny . . . and they will . they will tell you that you are wrong . they will call you a fool . but what you have got to understand , son , is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit . . . and they are scared of people like you . because you are smarter than all of them .
well . . . they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds . when they flood the house . that like . . . destruction is a form of creation . so the fact that they burn the money is . . . ironic . they just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart . they want to change things .
a six foot tall bunny rabbit .
why should we care ?
because the rabbits are us , donnie .
why should i mourn for a rabbit like it was a human ?
is the death of one species less tragic than another ?
of course . a rabbit is not like us . it has no history books . . . it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret . i like bunnies and all . they are cute . . . and they are horny . and if you are cute and horny . . . then you are probably happy that you do not know who you are . . . or why you are even alive . but the only thing i have known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die .
donnie . . . it is friday . should not you be off with your friends , scaring old people ?
where are you going ?
i do not know . that is a good question . . . but suffice to say that i am no longer your english teacher . they fired me .
that is bullshit . you are a good teacher .
thank you , donnie . and you are a good student . lazy . . . but a good student . unlike most of the others , you question mom and dad s rules .
what do i tell the rest of the class when they ask about you ?
tell them that everything is going to be just fine . it is up to the children to save themselves these days . because the parents . . . they do not have a clue .
a famous linguist once said . . . that of all the phrases in the english language , of all the endless combinations of words in all of history . . . that cellar door is the most beautiful .
sometimes it is the only thing that keeps us going .
i think i already have . but now she will not even talk to me .
then go find her , donnie . do not let her get away . she was right about the rabbits . go .
i have been taking it . i just like to make her feel guilty for all of this . you know , abuse her . psychologically .
all of this . . . certainly is not your mother s fault , donald .
would you like to talk about this friend ?
his name is frank .
frank .
i think he saved my life .
how so ?
do not you watch the news ?
i do not own a television .
a jet engine fell on my house . . . landed on my bed . while i was talking to frank on the golf course .
he said to follow him .
follow him where ?
into the future . then he said that the world was coming to an end .
no . that is stupid .
yes .
so , tell me about your day , donald .
i met a girl .
what is her name ?
gretchen . we are going together now .
do you think a lot about girls ?
yes .
how are things going at school ?
i think about girls a lot .
i asked you about school .
i think about . . . fucking a lot during school .
what else do you think about during school ?
i think . . . about . . . who s the boss ?
who is the boss ?
i just turn the volume down and think about fucking alyssa milano .
what about your family , donnie ?
no , i do not think about fucking my family . that is sick !
donnie . . . i want to hear about your friend frank .
four times . . . so far .
can anyone else see him ?
i do not think so . it is like a tv station . and they are tuned into mine and no one else s .
who is they ? is frank part of some larger group ?
i do not know . gretchen has a theory . that frank is a sign . i told her i thought it was ridiculous .
a sign from whom ?
i think that frank wants me to go to this woman . she wrote a book about time travel . frank asked me if i believed in time travel . that cannot just be a random coincidence . my dad almost hit her with the car the other day , and she said the creepiest thing . she said that every living creature on this earth dies alone .
how does that make you feel ?
it reminded me of my dog callie .
is callie still around ?
no . she died when i was eight . we could not find her for days . she went and crawled underneath our back porch . . .
do you feel alone right now ?
no . that makes you keep searching .
it was just like she described them in her book . like they were alive . the way that they looked . . . moved . . . smelled . they were like workers . . . assigned to each one of us . i followed my spear . . . and i found something . . .
what did you find ?
have you told gretchen about the spears ?
yeah , but if i told her about the other stuff about frank . . .
are you embarrassed by these things that you see ?
you know . . . every week i come in here and i tell you stuff . . . and it is all embarrassing . i tell you stuff that i do not tell anyone else . . . and you know what ? it is your turn , dr . thurman . i am not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself .
i know .
i mean . . . gretchen . . . she will not even let me kiss her . she says because it is our first kiss . . . she is , like , waiting for this big . . . moment or something . i just do not get it . i just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff .
the good stuff .
yeah . . . you know . . . fucking .
have you ever made love , donald ?
yes .
so , your parents . . . why did you disappoint them ?
i . . . i was playing with fire .
is it frank who wants you to destroy the world , to set the world on fire ?
but it was an accident . the house was under construction .
people get hurt . i do not want to hurt anyone .
but you were punished .
yes . i went to jail .
do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead ?
they . . . did not buy me what i wanted for christmas that year .
what did you want for christmas that year ?
hungry hungry hippos .
how did you feel . . . being denied those hungry hungry hippos ?
regret .
what else makes you feel regret ?
that i did it again .
you have done it again ?
yes . i flooded my school . . . and i burned down that pervert s house . i think i only have a few days left . . . before they catch me .
why did you do these things , donnie ? did frank tell you to commit these crimes ?
if god exists ?
i think now that he might . . .
why ?
because i am so horny .
god exists because you are horny .
i think so . i think that is one of the clues . it is a clue that tells us . . . to keep going .
where are we going ?
i have the power to build a time machine .
how is that possible ?
grandma death will teach me how . soon .
then how is time travel possible ?
it would have to be god s portal . they will lead me to it . then i will go back in time . . . and i will not feel regret anymore .
when will this happen ?
soon . time is almost up .
frank is going to kill .
who is he going to kill ?
where is he , donald ?
he is right there . . . he can read my mind and he will show me the way out of this . the sky is going to open up . . . and then he will reveal himself to me .
if the sky were to suddenly open up . . . there would be no law . . . there would be no rule . there would only be you and your memories . . . the choices you have made and the people you have touched . the life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged . . . by which you must judge yourself . because when this world ends , there will only be you and him . . . and no one else .
it is too late . i have already ruined my life .
you will survive this . . . donald . i promise you that you will survive . you must let me help you . and when i clap my hands together , you will wake up .
thank you .
donald , an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a god . you are an agnostic . an agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of god . . . but does not deny the possibility that god exists .
goodbye , dr . thurman .
goodbye , donald .
maybe you would like to tell mom and dad why you stopped taking your medication .
what does time travel have to do with philosophy ?
guess who wrote it ?
yeah .
that is her name ?
you are not gonna tell mom , are you ?
why would i tell mom ?
because you tell mom everything .
no i do not . she worries about you .
well , do not worry . . . i am taking my medication .
it is not that . i mean mouthing off to your teachers . i will admit . . . when dad told me what you said to ms . farmer , i laughed my ass off .
i was just being honest .
yeah . . . well , that is not the way the world works . if you keep being too honest , the world will eventually find a way to destroy you .
her name is gretchen .
that is a nice name . ok , let me see it .
congratulations .
okay , but it has to be a small one .
everything is going to be just fine .
excuse me ? that is your name , son ?
gerald .
well , gerald , i think you are afraid .
well , jim , i think you are full of shit !
well , i think you are the fucking anti christ .
what i think is going on with your son .
well , you know about his past . and when you said to look for signs of aggression . . . he was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher .
come again ?
frank . . . the giant bunny rabbit ?
frank ?
donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination .
you are telling me my son has an imaginary friend ?
he has described lengthy conversations . . . physical encounters with what i believe to be a manifestation of his subconscious mind .
i would like to put him through more hypnotherapy . . . and increase his medication .
but let me remind you that this treatment is . . . experimental .
you are not a bitch .
you are entering a new dimension of sight and sound . . .
frankie feedler . you remember him from high school ?
he was a year ahead of us ?
he died , remember ? on the way to the prom . he was doomed .
if you think michael dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out , then i think you are misinformed .
donnie ? you are a dick .
that is enough .
you can suck a fuck .
how did you know
i did not realise it was such a big deal .
it is a big deal .
i caught him flushing pills down the toilet . he knows you check the container .
do not worry , mom . just go , you will miss your flight .
what else ?
what else ? shit , principal cole , you ai not gonna believe what else .
yep .
how did this happen ?
i guess they made him do it .
the pta is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school s curriculum .
i think we have all seen bonanza .
rose , i will tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and i respect you as a woman . but after witnessing your songs behaviour today , i have . . . significant doubts . . . our paths through life must be righteous . i urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear .
kitty . . .
rose , we have a crisis . i am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against jim cunningham .
yes , i saw the news . something about a kiddie porn dungeon .
please ! do not say those words . well . . . as you can see . . . many of us are devastated by this news . this is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man . and i have taken it upon myself to spearhead the jim cunningham defence campaign . but unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest . . . which involves you .
beg pardon ?
rose . . . i have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning . and as you know , the girls also leave for los angeles tomorrow morning . now , as their coach . . . i was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip .
but now you cannot go .
yes . and believe me , of all the other mothers i would never dream of asking you , given the predicament with your son . but none of the other mothers are able to go .
oh , kitty , i do not know . this is so last minute . . . eddie is in new york . . .
rose . . . i do not know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters . this has been a dream of ours for a long time . sometimes i doubt your commitment to sparkle motion .
mr . cole . . . not only am i a teacher . . . but i am also a parent of a middlesex child . therefore , i am the only person here who transcends the parent teacher bridge .
kitty . . .
the bottom line . . . mr . cole . . . is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour .
this meeting of the pta was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation . . .
i am the pta ! and i say that this filth is directly related to this vandalism .

if chewing gum is chewed , the chewer is pursued and in the hoosegow hidden . . .
if we should choose to chew , we will be pursued
if any form of pleasure is exhibited report to me and it will be prohibited . i will put my foot down so shall it be this is the land of the free . the last man nearly ruined this place he did not know what to do with it . if you think this country s bad off now just wait till i get through with it . the treasury is low on dough the last man went and flew with it . if you think we are short of money now just wait till i get through with it . the country s taxes must be fixed and i know what to do with it , if you think you are paying too much now , just wait till i get through with it .
so everyone beware who s crooked or unfair no one must take a bit of graft unless he gets his share .
if any man should come between a husband and his bride , we find out which one she prefers by letting her decide . if she prefers the other man , the husband steps outside we stand him up against the wall and pop goes the weasel !
the husband steps outside relinquishes his bride we stand him up against the wall and take him for a ride .
the population must increase with great rapidity . we give a couple seven years to raise a family . if , by that time , there is no branch upon the family tree , we stand em up against the wall and pop goes the weasel .
you could not hang me in your bedroom i will make a note of it . where is my secretary ?
carry out this tragic folly if you will but i for one will not be a part of it . i will stay here in freedonia .
yes , but i will talk to you about that when we are alone . . .
this is a fine thing to be doing at my age .
are you getting tired ?
not at all . when i was a boy back on the farm i used to pump my own water .
tired ! i would like to stretch this into a week
i bring you the greetings of my president and the good will of my people .
i will keep the greetings but you can send back the good will . . . what we need right now is twenty million dollars .
twenty million dollars is a considerable sum . . . i will have to discuss that with my minister of finance .
well , in the meantime , could you let me have personally ?
?
i will tell you what i will do . i will give you mrs . teasdale as security . or my jackknife . if you want my advice , you will take the jackknife . . . i have a better proposition . . . make it and i will give you a first mortgage on my son and i hope you foreclose .
your excellency , have not we met before ?
why yes . i met you at the dog races say , you could have won that race if you tried a little harder .
go ahead .
you do not understand . this is my niece vera .
and vera niece , too .
cannot we go some place where we can be alone ?
what can this mug offer you ? wealth and family . i cannot give you wealth . . . . . . but we can have a little family of our own .
well , why not say the least and get it over with ?
you swine !
give me that again !
you worm !
once more !
you upstart !
that is it ! no man lives who can call a firefly an upstart .
yes .
how are ya fixed for ammunition ?
bah ! !
then it is war !
forget ? you ask me to forget . . . why , my ancestors would rise from their graves . . . and i would only have to bury them again . . . a firefly never forgets . . .
i am willing to apologize . . . i am willing to do anything to prevent this war .
nothing doing ! ! i have taken a lease on the battlefield . i would lose my deposit , besides , i have already ordered the ammunition . . .
i do not remember .
oh you mean . . . worm ?
no , that was not it . . .
was it swine ?
no . . . it was a seven letter word .
oh yes ! upstart !
that is it . . .
i still like upstart the best .
you can keep it i have got a whole pack . . . now what were you saying ?
well , i will not stand for much . and i will not stand for you if you do not show some improvement soon . look at your report card last month d in spelling . . . six in behavior . now who were the six ? a fine state of affairs no wonder you cannot matriculate , now what were you saying ?
the future of freedonia rests upon you . promise me you will follow in my husband s footsteps .
i have not been on the job five minutes and already she is making advances to me . not that i care but where is your husband ?
why er my husband passed away . . . i was with him to the very end .
no wonder he passed away . i would like to be with you to the very end . cannot you see what i am trying to tell you i love you .
your excellency !
you are not so bad yourself , mrs . teasdale , when i look at you i can see that we are facing a crisis . we have got to balance the budget we have got to cut down everything including , you .
well , a gal a day is enough for me . i could not handle any more .
if it is not asking too much for our information just for illustration tell us how you intend to run the nation .
these are the laws of my administration no one s allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke and whistling is forbidden . . .
that is what i get for dressing in a hurry .
your excellency , you must not forget your appointment at the house of representatives . . . have you got your speech ready ?
i wrote a speech last night that will knock them off their seats . . . four score and seven years ago , our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation
why , that is the speech that lincoln made at gettysburg . . .
he did ? . . . i told my son not to leave it laying around . . . where is son ?
all i can offer you is a rufus over your head .
oh , your excellency , i do not know what to say .
i would not know what to say either if i was in your place . maybe you can suggest something .
but your excellency the ambassador is here on a friendly visit . . . he came to ask you to patch up the breach .
let him patch up his own breeches . . .
well , maybe i am a little headstrong . . . but , you know , it is awfully hard to forget what he called me .
now er
well they might come better but they do not come any bigger . . . and the bigger the better . the bigger the betta you have got on a horse , the more you lose , and speaking about horses , why do not you marry me . come , come say yes and you will never see me again . i will go way if it means your happiness . . .
oh , your excellency , you take me off my feet .
why why of course .
you can call me gloria too . gloria what a beautiful name . when i was born my mother named me gloria two minutes later she found out her mistake . . .
take a seat you are next .
your excellency , something terrible has just happened .
that is all right . i will fix you right up .
what ?
do not bother me i am thinking what was that ?
i said i suspect the secretary of war .
this is treason ! ! what a fool i was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms
but
you satisfied your selfish whims , while nations tottered , dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion not bad , eh ?
the king can do no wrong !
what is money ? mrs . teasdale , for you i would do anything .
ambassador ! i am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator .
mrs . teasdale no matter who rules freedonia , to me you will always be the first lady of the land .
ambassador trentino , i am indeed honored . . . but you see well i
oh . then there his somebody else ?
well no not exactly but
gloria i have waited for years . i will not be put off ! i love you ! i want you ! cannot you see that i am at your feet ?
i did not come here to be insulted .
this is terrible !
oh , would you . . . ?
for you , i would do anything . . .
with mrs . teasdale as my wife and freedonia under my control
maybe it is not going to be so easy . from what i have heard , mrs . teasdale is rather sweet on this rufus t . firefly .
that is where you come in . i will leave him in your hands , and do not forget you are supposed to be my niece .
my dear niece i must ask you not to interfere . war is not a womangs problem .
it is every womangs problem . who supplies the sons ? the brothers ? the husbands ? who . . .
i thought everything was working out fine .
fine nothing ! i did not want war . . . my plan was to marry mrs . teasdale and overthrow firefly .
maybe you can still win the old dame over why not try to
perhaps he will listen to you . . .
yes please , two .
one or two ?
two , please .
oh ?
how lovely .
i have always thought that myself .
oh , yes .
she has the face of an angel . . . she was an angel . she was so kind . . . so kind to me . it is not her fault , for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant . i am sure i must have been a great disappointment to her .
oh no , mr . merrick . no . no son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment .
if only i could find her . if only she could see me now , here , with such lovely kind friends . you , mrs . treves , and you , mr . treves . then maybe she would love me as i am . i have tried to hard to be good .
i will join you shortly .
yes , very well , i think . are the girls in bed ?
yes , and they send their kisses . would you like your sherry now ?
no , i think a whiskey .
i should not be . we made great progress today . i taught him to repeat a few basic phrases . he did rather well , too , but i had to lead him every step of the way . though frankly , at times i was unsure of who was leading whom .
what do you mean ?
well , i was not sure whether he was parroting me because that is all he was capable of , or whether he sensed that that is all i wanted to hear , and he was trying to please me .
but i thought you said that he was rather . . . simple ?
he is . i mean , i have always thought he was . i think he must be . is he simple ? or is that just something i have wished upon him to make things simpler for myself ?
i do not know . i cannot explain it . if this is an intelligent man , trapped in the body of a monster , then i am under a moral obligation to help free that mind , free that spirit as best i can , to help him live as full and content a life as possible . but ! if he is an imbecile , who s body i cannot treat and who s mind i cannot touch , well , then my obligation is discharged . they can put him where they will he will not be bothered , i will not be bothered , and everyone s conscience can remain free and untroubled . and that is my dilemma . . . what is in his mind ?
and what qualities are those ? intelligence or stupidity ?
i am sure i do not know , freddie .
well , these things take time .
i have only got until two o clock tomorrow afternoon , when carr gomm meets him . somehow , between now and then i have got to make john merrick at least seem like an intelligent man . . . why am i fooling myself ? nothing short of john delivering the sermon on the mount is going to sway carr gomm . . .
do you ?
and here are my mother and father .
dinner will be served , shortly , dear .
hmmm ?
. . . freddie ! that is the matter ? you have been like this all evening .
oh . . . i have just been thinking about something that man bytes said .
oh , freddie . what could that wretched vampire say to upset you ?
that i am very little different from him .
oh that is absurd , frederick . no , no frederick , that is all wrong ! john is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life . and , that is completely due to you .
but why did i do it ? what was this all for ? so john merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort ? or so i could become famous ?
frederick , just what is it that you are saying ?
. . . am i a good man or am i a bad man ?
oh frederick .
yes ?
i found it .
did you see it ?
what is it ?
like this .
i will get my bag .
aw , bytes , he is sick .
he is doing it to spite me , i tell you , and it is got to stop !
he is sick , bytes . he is going to die .
if he does it is his own fault ! but i am not burying that swollen bag of flesh .
i will show you ! i will show you !
shut up !
what do you mean ?
he was fine when he left here , and now look at him .
i intend to .
he fell . he falls .
he must have taken quite a fall .
why is he sitting up like this ? he needs rest .
that is the way he sleeps . if he lays down , he will die . head s too heavy .
cannot you fix him up here ? . . . he is my livelihood . listen .
you listen , you are not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies . he is got the rale , he is very weak , and i do not know how much damage has been done by his fall . now stop wasting time and fetch a cab .
everything will be seen to .
just a moment , how did you get in here ?
never mind that , i want my man !
he is still very sick . please come downstairs with me . i will explain the situation .
do not . . . do not muck me about . you have had plenty of time to fix him up , and he is leaving with me , now . do you understand me ? now , mr . treves . we had a bargain !
you misunderstood . this man suffered a severe fall , if you take my meaning . he is my patient now and i must do what . . .
pull the other one , why do not you ! we made a deal !
i know what you have done to him and he is never going back to that .
he is a freak ! that is how they live . we are partners , him and i , business partners . you are willfully depriving me of my livlihood !
all you do is profit from another mangs misery !
you think you are better n me ? you wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself , you guv . so i gave him to you . on trust , in the name of science ! and now i want him back .
you do not own this man !
i want him back !
so you can beat him ? so you can starve him ? a dog in the street would fare better with you !
i have got my rights , damn you , and i am going to the authorities !
right . . . right .
good morning , sir .
you have acquired a taste for this ?
it is quite nutritious , sir .
do not be mad . this muck can kill you .
indeed !
no sir , he is got bronchitis and he is been badly beaten .
why is not he in the general ward , then ?
well sir , he is quite seriously deformed , and i fear the other patients would find him . . . rather shocking .
deformed ? is that it . then am i to assume that he is ultimately incurable ?
yes sir .
what are your plans then , treves . . . you are aware that the london does not accept incurables . the rules are quite clear on that point .
yes , i am well aware of that . but this case is quite exceptional .
oh , is he a friend of yours ?
no , more of an acquaintance .
yes sir , i will look into that . would you like to meet him sir ?
ah , no sir . i had planned to see them in the morning .
good ! how is the patient ?
he is doing very well . in fact that is why i came to see you . i think that if i were to present mr . merrick to the hospital committee , then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease , but of the man as well . if the committee had a chance to speak with him , hear him say a few words for himself , i am sure they would see him as a patient , rather than as a violation of the rules .
a few words ? i thought he was imbecile ?
well sir , perhaps i should explain . . .
i really do not think that is necessary treves . i am quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case , such as they are .
i do not agree . no one can make a reasonable decision about this mangs future without at least meeting him . no doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met .
no , treves , it is out of the question . now if it was up to me , i would say certainly , let s meet the fellow , by all means , i am sorry , i simply cannot speak for the other members of the committee .
then will you meet him , as a representative of the committee .
mr . treves , it is out of the question . i want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do . i am sorry .
thank you very much sir . shall we say in a few days then ?
shall we say two o clock tomorrow afternoon ?
wh . . . whatever is most convenient for you , sir .
two o clock then . . . you know treves . . . it seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance .
. . . yes , sir .
speaking is one thing , treves , but can the man comprehend ?
he need not . i have no desire to cause him any discomfort . did you make those inquiries we spoke about ?
yes , i spoke to both the british home and royal hospital for incurables . i am afraid that they were not very encouraging , but they said they would bring it up at their next committee meeting , so we should have their answers shortly .
fine , fine . you know , your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing , treves . but you must remember that this is a hospital , and there are many patients here . patients who can be made well , and you owe them your first consideration . just do not become so obsessed , old man , that you begin to neglect them .
and what was that , john ?
yes , i am very sorry to have wasted your time , sir . i just felt that i had to do anything i could to protect him .
i am sorry too . he simply does not belong here . he is be much happier somewhere else , where he could be constantly looked after . believe me , frederick , it is better that it worked out this way . good day .
i do not understand .
tell me , john , how did you know the rest of the rd psalm ?
not me , sir . mr . merrick . he succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness .
yes , i think i can .
no you cannot . you cannot begin to know , no one can .
i could easily arrange . . .
no , not that way . broadneck and the others do not like to deal with patients directly . it makes them queasy . . . do you have any photographs of mr . merrick ?
well , yes .
excellent . we shall present them , along with the other particulars of the case to the committee . i want them to see , exactly , how horribly his body has been affected . you and i shall vouch for his inner qualities .
do you think they will go along with us ?
of course they will . they are reasonable men .
no , we do not . their committees have informed me that they are unwilling to take mr . merrick , even if they were supplied with funds . they do not want him .
well , it is up to us then , is not it ?
frankly , treves , it is not what i would expected . a few small cheques . well wishers . do not worry , these things undoubtedly take time .
but he is so afraid he is going to be carted off . i have promised him that will not happen .
well . . . i will let you know if there s something in the afternoon post .
please do .
steady on , treves . have a seat .
i feel much better . thank you for asking . and you ?
i am feeling very fit , thank you . how is your bronchitis ?
i feel much better . thank you .
are you comfortable here ?
everyone has been very kind . i am extremely grateful .
of course . how long did you and mr . treves prepare for this interview ?
yes , of course . . . well , it is been a pleasure meeting you , mr . merrick . good day .
thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies , thou anointest my head with oil . . .
i am very pleased to meet you .
i hope we can talk together again sometime . good day .
three quarters of an hour .
mmmm . hodges , pierce come closer . mr . hill , take hold of the rope please . it is a machine accident . i expect you will be seeing a good deal of this .
what a mess .
oh nothing . . . nothing of any great importance .
you will know presently . at the meeting of the society . but until then , i beg of you fox , keep it to yourself .
certainly , if you insist . you must have quite a find there .
i do not know what i have got .
nothing of any importance , eh ?
he is imbecile , no doubt from birth . he speaks , but . . . it is all gibberish . no , the mangs a homeless idiot . . . i pray god he is an idiot .
your majesty shall mock at me i cannot speak your england .
o fair katharine , if you will love me soundly with your french heart , i will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your english tongue . do you like me , kate ?
pardonnez moi , i cannot tell vat is like me .
an angel is like you , kate , and you are like an angel .
o bon dieu ! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies .
what say you , fair one ? that the tongues of men are full of deceits ?
oui , dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits .
i know no way to mince it in love , but directly to say i love you . what ! a speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad . a good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will turn white a curl would pate will grow bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax hollow but a good heart , kate , is the sun and the moon , or rather the sun and not the moon for it shines bright and never changes , but keeps his course truly .
i have brought you some things . i hope you will like , mr . merrick . i hope you do not think it too forward .
oh , no .
i knew you would understand . here .
oh , no . i would never think it ! it is so beautiful . you are so . . . i will give it a place of honor , here , next to my mother .
yes .
oh no , mr . merrick . i just work there .
well , even to work there would be wonderful . is it beautiful ?
you have never been ?
alas , no .
well you must go . it is one of the most beautiful places on earth . of course , i am rather partial .
tell me about it , please !
it is very difficult to put into a nutshell , but i should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination , where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world , to any time you desire . you may look over the shoulders of kings , unobserved , battle with ruthless tyrants , and marry the beautiful princess , all in the space of a few hours . onstage you may be whoever you wish to be , do anything you please , and always , always live happily ever after . the theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world , mr . merrick . it is lights and music , gaiety and joy . it is . . . well , it is romance .
romance !
that is one thing the theatre has in great store . which reminds me . i have something else for you . . .
no , but i certainly shall .
ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .
o , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do . they pray , grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .
oh no ?
oh no . . . no . . . you are a romeo .
good day , mr . merrick .
i am very grateful to you , mrs . kendal . this is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal . john will be very excited .
well it is a miracle he ever got back . and , i am sure , mr . treves , under your expert care , he will have many happy years ahead .
i fear not , mrs . kendal . even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly . . . as is his pain .
how awful for john .
and yet , not once have any of us heard him complain .
is he . . . dying then ?
yes . there is nothing more frustrating , nothing that makes a physician feel more useless , than standing by watching his patient deteriorate . and when that patient is a friend , no . . . no , there s absolutely nothing i can do .
well , it is all quite . . . i have never heard . . . it is quite . . .
yes .
y y yes
want to come out ?
you are english .
of course ! you want out ?
yes .
will not be a moment .
oh no , my friend . . .
say hello to london for me . i miss her .
oh , yes .
you know , i saw you once there , in london . you are a great attraction .
yes .
well , if there is nothing more , i suppose we will be leaving you now .
no , nothing .
good morning .
yes .
but it is so good , i mean . . . it is so very good .
thank you . . . very much .
where did you get this box ?
i meant no harm , it was the only place where i could find cardboard . i thought it has been thrown away .
it is alright , it was thrown away . no one wants it . it is just that it is a little dirty , that is all .
the main spire .
the . . . oh , the spire ! how silly of me , it is as plain as day . . . mr . merrick , where did you learn to do this ?
. . . i learned a long time ago .
yes . . . well , good day , mr . merrick .
yes john !
yyyess .
yyess .

yes !
very good ! oh yes ! now listen . i am going to say some things to you and i want you to repeat them . . . um . . . i want you to say them back to me . do you understand ? i am going to say some things to you and i want you to say them back to me . do you understand ?

hello . . . my name is john merrick . i am very pleased to meet you .
oh yes ! it is much better than what i am used to .
but the variety of food here is very pleasing . . . i commend you .
you did not ask me .
i never thought to ask . how can you ever forgive me ?
oh , no do not say that . you have been so kind to me . i was afraid to say too much . people always want me to be quiet . you wanted me to speak , but i was afraid . forgive me .
we do have a lot to talk about , do not we ?
good evening . very well , thank you . and you ?
very well , thank you . i have something for you , john . i am sure you will enjoy it , it is very popular .
yes .
the hospital ?
of course ! what did you think ?
i promise you . you will never see the inside of that horrible place again . you will never , ever go back to the workhouse . . . or that man . it is a splendid room , do not you think ?
thank you very much .
when one is invited to tea , one must look one s best .
i am not used to such kindness . from a beautiful woman .
that is a canopy , john .
ohhh . . .
how is your tea , john ?
it is very good . i am enjoying my visit with you very much . it is so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home . i am sorry i made a spectacle of myself .
not at all , john .
i love the way you have arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece . is that the way it is done in most houses ?
oh yes .
who are they of ?
oh , our relatives . . . the children .
the children ! may i see ?
of course .
oh , they are gone for the day . . . with friends .
friends . ah yes , friends ! how nice .
your mother ?
here .
good morning .
john , there s someone here who would like to meet you . would that be alright ?
never , oh ! never , nothing will die . the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats nothing will die .
yes , john ?
. . . can you cure me ?
i thought as much .
yes , soon i will start the main spire , but i must finish these columns first , how kind of her !
oh no ! there is nothing ! i have everything , you have given me everything i could possibly want . i am happy every hour of the day . i only wish there was something i could give to you .
please john , it would give me so much pleasure to give you something . something just for yourself . is not there something you would like to have ?
you do not think it is too gaudy , do you ?
yes , john .
you did this for me ?
yes .
please . . . please thank the governing committee for me . i will do my utmost to merit their kindness .
there is one more thing , john . here .
oh , mr . treves . mr . treves .
are you sure ? because i can take it back .
mr . treves . thank you my . . . friends .
john . . . . how can you ever forgive me ?
oh no , i could not .
it is for you , john . it is all for you . go ahead , let them see you .
yes , very soon .
splendid . it is truly a masterpiece . well , i suppose i will be on my way now . i hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening .
oh yes ! it was wonderful !
i am glad , john . goodnight .
mr . treves , tell me . . . tell me truly . is it alright , did i make any mistakes that you can see ?
no , john , not one that i can see .
then i should not change anything ?
no , no , i would not change a thing .
you too , my friend . goodnight .
fine .
good . excellent . now then , mrs . mothershead , i want you to come into this room with me . inside there is a man with a rather . . . unfortunate appearance .
i have heard .
yes . . . well , i want you to clear up a little mess , a breakfast tray was spilt . and bring up another breakfast . when you have done that , you and i shall give the man a bath . but , mothershead , i am counting on your many years of experience to get you through this , above all , do not scream , do not cry out , or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him . . .
sir , you do not have to worry about me . i am not the sort to cry out . shall we go in ?
yes . . . yes , let s go in .
yes ! the workhouse !
not quite yet , mrs . mothershead . there seems to be some difficulty this morning .
no , he is very upset about something .
just being obstinate , sir . i will handle it .
perhaps you have got the time for that , mr . treves , i certainly do not . i have got an entire hospital to look after , and you have your real patients . do not waste your time with him sir , it is like talking to a wall . i do not mean to be harsh , but truthfully what can you do for him ? i will be back later for his bath . and mr . carr gomm would like to see you when you have a moment . good day sir .
we have made tremendous strides today , mothershead . he listens and repeats with great attention , and this certainly is not easy for him .
parrots can do as much , mr . treves . it is all very nice , but i do not see the point . you know they will not let him stay here .
i am sure that if mr . merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they would see that he is the exception to their rule . now i am not expecting miracles . i am not saying he will be able to read or write , but i do think that i can get him to speak for himself . i am going to arrange things with carr gomm right now . that was very good , john , very good . that is all for today . we shall do some more tomorrow . mothershead ?
i regret that i must leave you here , m lord , m lady . thank you so much for coming . it was an act of the greatest charity .
excuse me , sir . i would like to have a word with you .
oh ? . . . well , quickly please , mothershead , i am overdue .
i cannot understand why you let those people go in there , sir .
now mothershead , you have to understand that this is very good for john . he relishes contact with people outside the hospital . . .
but you saw them , sir . they could not hide their disgust . they do not care anything for john , they are just trying to impress their friends .
are not you being just a little harsh , mothershead ? you yourself hardly treated john with much loving kindness when he first arrived .
i bathed him , did not i ? i fed him and cleaned up after him ! if loving kindness can be called care and practical concern , then yes , i did treat him with loving kindness , and i am not ashamed to say it .
you are right , mothershead , please forgive me . . . of course , i appreciate everything you have done for john , and i am glad that you are concerned about his welfare . but , i am the physician in charge and i must do what i think best . i am also very late , so please forgive me .
thank you , mothershead . have a porter put them in my office .
yes sir . that is that ?
a dressing bag .
very smart indeed .
yes . john wants it .
a dressing bag ?
you do not think it is too gaudy , do you .
well . . .
john thinks it is very dashing . something no gentleman should be without . i am inclined to agree .
welcome home , john .
i . . . i do not know what you mean , sir .
take him ? now wait . . . i did not take him anywhere . we were just having some fun . we did not hurt him . . . just having a laugh , that is all .
he is gone !
when i left him , he was in his bed , safe and sound .
you bastard ! you tortured him . you tortured him , you bastard . where is he ?
you are not listening to me ! i ai not done nothing wrong . people pay to see your monster , mr . treves . i just take the money .
you are the monster ! you are the freak ! get out ! you are finished !
and who might you be , sir ?
just one of the curious . i would like to see it .
i do not think so . no sir , we are closed .
handsomely ? . . . who sent you ?
pardon me ?
never mind . i am the owner .
bytes . mr . bytes . he will be there .
i will send a cab . here is my card .
ah ! it is my father !
open up ! i know you are in there !
who , father ?
who ? who ? whoever you have got in here of course !
there is no one .
there s nobody here , father . look for yourself .
you are losing your temper !
i do not know how you do it , aud . . . i sometimes think you have got some of your mother s magic . . .
she did , i tell you ! she could blind me as easily as the night the day .
it is your fantasy . . .
but one day i will catch you . . . like i caught her . . .
but , father , it is !
well , my dear , i think you will find it is all a question of what you want to believe in . . . . i have slightly more experience of these matters than you . . .
i said welcome .
welcome ?
well , of course . we always welcome friends .
well , everyone is friends here on hy brasil .
what are what ?
those things in your hands .
these ? what are these ? they are swords .
please ! you do not know what you are doing !
what ?
put them down ! please make them put them down .
yes .
but surely you know . . . ?
what . . . you mean got into bed with them ?
no , of course not , silly i mean felt like this about them ?
you mean . . . you have got into bed with somebody else ?
no , i mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you would met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart . . . someone whose goals suddenly seem to be your goals . . . whose dreams seem to be your dreams ?
have you ever been to bed with anyone else ?
what does that matter ? but you have . . . you have . . . felt like this before . . .
it was different . . .
what was she like ?
oh . . . oh , i did not know her very well . . .
but you loved her all the same . . .
we never went to bed together .
why do you go on about that ? what does it matter ?
you have been to bed with somebody else , have not you ?
i have never loved anybody !
i have never been to bed with anybody !
the fifth one this week !
oh , for goodness sake !
and i thought you said it was something special . . .
five this week how many the week before ?
you are as bad as my father .
and the week before that ?
who ?
halfdan the black .
but , erik . . .
i mean , you could have killed yourself .
why ?
i will bring it back .
erik . you do not understand .
no . it is you who does not understand , aud . halfdan has come to kill and destroy . we brought him here . we must stop him .
but you do not realize . . . .
goodbye , aud . . .
no ! wait ! erik ! the cloak ! the cloak invisible ! it only seems to work on my father !
that is right !
i must look ! keitel ! hold this !
of course .
do you believe i love you ?
i . . . but i . . .
you do not have to love me . just do you believe i love you ?
yes i believe you do .
then let go !
the second note to wake the gods . . .
not quite . . .
there is something i must ask the gods . . .
no living man has ever set foot in the halls of asgaard . . . the gods will never let you return .
no . . . no . . .
i do not want to live without you .
but , aud . . . i . . . i came to find someone . . .
halfdan wanted to stop you waking the gods . . . so . . . i disguised myself to sabotage their plans .
it was my master keitel s idea .
what d you mean ?
we blew the horn resounding .
she blew the horn resounding .
i should not have come .
they will make fun of you for listening to an old womangs stories ?
i see the world .
is it night or day , erik ?
it is day , of course , freya .
is it summer or winter , erik ?
the sun is up beyond the clouds where it always is .
but have you ever seen it ? think back . . .
of course not . . . but . . . when i was a child . . . i remember a dream . . . . it was as if the whole sky was blue . . .
the sky was blue , erik . . . once .
the gods are asleep , erik .
i will go and wake them up !
that i cannot tell you .
the gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores , the whole of hy brasil will sink beneath the waves .
well . . . for a start . . . er . . . there s no killing . . .
well , obviously there s no killing .
well . . . is not it great ?
that is very kind of you , but we are in rather a hurry . . . we are . . .
oh . . . well , yes , of course it is just we are looking for the horn resounding and
you do not think our singing s going to be good enough for you ?
oh , no no no ! it is just the horn resounding is . . .
a lot of people like our singing .
i am sure it is lovely .
but you do not want to hear it .
no . . . no . . . we would love to hear it . would not we ?
you are just saying that .
really ?
really .
and you are not just saying it because you think we want you to ?
right ! summon the musicians ! we will do the one that goes tum tum tum tum ti tum tum
no , no . . . it was very . . . er , nice .
now i want you to be absolutely , totally , genuinely honest with me . did you really , truly , honestly like it ?
they did not like it ! oh god ! i want to die !
well , how d you think i feel ?
the gods are asleep , king arnulf .
you try to be nice to people , when they are rude about your singing . . .
yes ?
you have got to let me go !
they will be more than hurt if halfdan the black lands ! ow !
why ?
because that is how he makes his money , by war and plunder !
do not talk nonsense .
he wants to kill us !
not when we explain about the great blessing .
you do not know halfdan the black .
i know that the great blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years , and will keep it for the next thousand .
oh ! no ! no . . . of course not . . . it is just i had not expected it to be quite so big .
well , it is not called the horn resounding for nothing . you do know how to play the horn , do not you ?
yes . . . oh , yes . . .
then i expect you will be leaving first thing in the morning .
the important thing is not to panic .
me ? of course ! i have been looting and pillaging up and down the coast .
looting and pillaging , eh ?
yes .
what about the raping ?
shut up .
it is obvious you have not raped anyone in your life .
sh !
you do not love me .
no . . . right . . . this is rape . . . mark you , i am not saying i could not get to like you . . . in fact . . . well , to be quite honest , i prefer it when there s some sort of mutual feeling between two people . . .
what rape ?
no . it is not rape then , is it ?
oh , get it over with .
i do not suppose . . . no . . .
what ?
i do not suppose you . . . you do like me at all ?
what d you expect ? you come in here , burn my village , kill my family and try to rape me . . .
about raping me ?
about not raping you . . .
you do not like it , do you ?
well it just seems a little bit crude , that is all .
what about the killing and looting ? that is just as crude , is not it ?
oh well you have got to do them .
why ? why have you got to go round killing and looting ?
to pay for the next expedition , of course .
but that is a circular argument ! if the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition , they cancel each other out .
oh ! stop talking as if we were married !
well you started it .
i just said i did not feel like raping you .
and i was just saying that rape is no more pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on .
ah .
louder .
aaagh ! rape !
oh , thanks .
i did not mean to !
oh , that is all right then . . . it is the thought . . . that counts . . .
i dunno . . . you looked so . . . so vulnerable . . .
why should you care ?
why . . . should you care ?
tell me your name ?
what a stupid idea .
why ?
that is the point of being dead in the land of the living ?
i will ask the gods to give you life again !
well . . . no . . .
you will have to wait till he is finished his game .
odin !
i do not know ! i just did !
find it . . . and cross it !
but . . .
what ?
he was lucky . . . sit there .
come on , move it !
i know . snorri ! get your oar out !
it saved my father !
very deep . . . usually . . .
no .
you do not go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make friends .
you mean if just one person gets killed ?
i know !
he wants to kill us .
i know . i know .
do not you feel it ?
that is it all about ?
what ?
we toil and labor , we loot and pillage , rape and kill . . . and yet . . .
you talking piffle , son ?
where does it all get us , grandpa ?
who have you been talking to ?
i met this girl . . .
it is always the women that start the trouble .
she got me thinking . . .
so ? what would you do to her ?
that is my boy !
well , you are !
row ! row ! row !
sorry .
sorry !
make your mind up .
you may need a real berserk .
shut up . you there . you there and you there .
row !
the sun ! that is it !
what magic ?
i have heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight .
you will see !
look out !
we do not have to help anybody .
fenrir the wolf covers the sun men fight and kill each other the whole time .
why should we care ?
because . . . you are . . . you are the gods . . . .
so ?
bring the age of ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed .
but you are the gods !
look . . . erik . . .
no ! we would be the first living men to set foot in the halls of the gods .
now stop it !
it is so nice to feel wanted .
leif , you sit there . even , you sit there . harald , you would better sit over there . . .
trust me to get the missionary .
that is true . you would better sit there . you there , and ornulf there .
now you have got all the big ones on one side .
now you have got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other .
has anyone told him we have got a dragon eating our boat ?
well , come on !
like fish .
to the oars !
oh . . . i feel a little . . . oh . . .
i have got you !
you will be sucked down too !
no ! arrgh !
who gets killed ?
nobody gets killed .
oh . . . er . . . yes . . .
just say something cheerful .
oh . . . right ! well . . . cheers everybody !
right . farewell . . . for the last time . . . may the gods prevent . . .
no , do not say anything else !
keitel blacksmith ?
that is the matter with bjorn ?
but how could he know . . . unless . . .
but . . .
how about making friends ?
what is it ?
what are you talking about ?
i will join my grandfather there .
what if we could find bi frost the rainbow bridge ?
that is the matter ? are you afraid to try ?
we would be the first !
i do not know but i am not afraid to try .
i was sitting there .
it does not matter where you sit !
yes it does ! we could be at sea for months .
well , what difference does it make where you are sitting ?
i do not want to have to sit next to snorri all that time .
we have not got a spare place .
death !
she must have a knife or something . . .
is this hy brasil ?
over the edge of the world .
let me do something for myself for a change !
i have to go . . .
bye . . . sorry . . .
yeah . . . well . . .
you will wait ?
what d you expect me to do ?
please .
the dragon . . .
what do we have to do ?
nothing . . . i just immerse you in water . . .
do what ?
vanish into thin air ?
he has not .
well , where is he then ?
i thought i might do a bit of business on the way .
you are wasting your time .
listen . i have been in this dump for sixteen years and i have not made a single convert . . .
there was thorbjorn vifilssongs wife . you converted her .
thorbjorn vifilssongs wife became a buddhist , not a christian .
same thing , is not it ?
no , it is not .
your lord .
quite . . . my lord . . . said the prayer of faith shall have the sick .
i hope the dragon of the north sea gets you and your lord .
no , i am not .
you do not need to feel bad about being sea sick , you know .
how can you help feeling bad when you are sea sick ?
i mean many of the greatest sailors were .
olaf tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage . . . the whole time . . . non stop . . . puke . . . puke . . . puke .
look ! i do not feel bad about it . i just feel ill .
bastard .
that is it !
that is it ! and you keep wanting to go to the lavatory .
oh , yes ! i had not noticed that !
mum ! dad !
got you !
what are you talking about ?
i am not worth risking your life for .
i have got you , keitel blacksmith . if you go . . . i go too . . .
for your own sake . . . for the others . . . i . . .
hang on . . .
i . . . i . . .
it is me . i am just going to water the dragon . . .
oh . . .
what are you doing , keitel blacksmith ?
get away , snorri .
what have you got there ?
yes , it is good . but i told him ten .
you could charge him what you like .
oh , i could not do that ! the blacksmith s code says . . .
yes yes . . . of course . . . . the blacksmith s code . . .
cannot make enough swords !
cannot make enough axe heads !
but , keitel , if erik ever finds the horn resounding . . . if he ever crosses bi frost , the rainbow bridge . . . if he ever wakens the gods . .
the age of ragnarok ends . . .
the bottom falls out of the sword business !
it is not just your livelihood that is at stake but your songs , and the livelihood of all blacksmiths .
my brother blacksmiths !
that is right .
the blacksmith s code says i must . . .
honour and protect all blacksmiths .
together we stand !
you cannot let erik do that .
well . . . i . . . i thought . . .
how can we stops him now ?
you do it !
you will be able to throw it further than i could .
relax !
i am drowning ! help !
help !
you will drown us bo . . .
help !
she knows it was our fault !
keep your mouth shut , keitel !
no ! it is you , loki ! i should never have listened to you !
we came to stop you waking the gods , erik ! but i did not want anyone to get hurt !
you fool !
like you got rid of snorri !
by you keitel blacksmith ! do not you know , erik , that is why he went with you ? ragnarok was good for his business . . .
it is not my business any more !
i know , dad .
i was a berserk for king harald fairhair . . .
you went berserk . . .
i went berserk in every battle i ever fought for king harald . . .
so did your father . . .
so did my father and his father before him .
but it is a responsibility . . .
but it is a responsibility being a berserk .
i must only let the red rage . . .
you must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle .
i know ! i have heard it all thousand times !
not now , sven . . .
i must kill ! kill !
it is no good going berserk against a dragon !
stop it !
death to dragons !
sh !
i am just building up to it , dad .
give us a chance , dad !
helpless . . .
easy , dad !
and his you will never be a berserk if you lose your temper . . .
dad !
i hate you ! i hate you !
you liar !
neither am i .
me too .
erik s right ! we will all meet in valhalla .
i am not frightened . . . of anything . . .
you will see my grandfather in valhalla !
no . . . he is not . . . not . . . there . . .
tell him i am coming !
yes , mother .
and something to sharpen them with ?
yes , mum .
and do not forget never let your enemy get behind you .
no , mother .
and keep your sword greased .
yes , mother . goodbye , dad .
i never do . . .
she is punishing me for being honest . i should just go to her house .
i do not know . i am so . . . i cannot believe she would be so goddamn immature !
they cannot erase memories . it is a joke . it is a nasty clementine hoax .
sweetie , we called the company .
i hope you feel better , sweetie .
yeah .
say hi to naomi .
just a little overworked , maybe .
i did . you said , things were fine .
i remember .

yeah , you told me that later .
i told you that later .
no one .
anyhoo , sweetie , i done a bad thing . i kinda sorta wrecked your car . . .
but , i do not know , maybe we are the normal ones , y know ? i mean , what kind of people do well at this stuff ?
and i just liked you so much .
you did ? you liked me ?
hi , joel . so no jokes about my name ?
yeah , hi , i have a one o clock with dr . mierzwiak . clementine kruczynski .

nothing is wrong with you . you are the most wonderful person i have ever met .
okay , i guess .
well , why do not you tell me that is going on ? do you mind if i turn this on ?
you guess he is your boyfriend ? or you guess you are having a bad time with him ?
what ? no . i do not like the term boyfriend . it is so gay .
i think i know . i think we can help . why do not you start by telling me about your relationship . everything you can think of . everything about him . everything about you . and we will take it from there .
why ?
why what ?
why are you sorry ? i just said hi .
no , i did not know if you were talking to me , so . . .
well , i did not want to assume .
aw , c mon , live dangerously . take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car .
anyway . sorry . hi .
no , i mean , i do not know . i cannot really think of much to say probably .
oh . so . . .
no , i do not want to bug you if you are trying to
it is okay , really .
just , you know , to chat a little , maybe . i have a long trip ahead of me . how far are you going ? on the train , i mean , of course .
rockville center .
get out ! me too ! what are the odds ?
the weirder part is i think actually i recognize you . i thought that earlier in the diner . that is why i was looking at you . you work at borders , right ?
ucch , really ? you are kidding . god . bizarre small world , huh ? yeah , that is me book slave there for , like , five years now .
really ? because
jesus , is it five years ? i gotta quit right now .
because i go there all the time . i do not think i ever saw you before .
well , i am there . i hide in the back as much as is humanly possible . you have a cell phone ? i need to quit right this minute . i will call in dead .
i do not have one .
i will go on the dole . like my daddy before me .
i noticed your hair . i guess it made an impression on me , that is why i was pretty sure i recognized you .
ah , the hair . blue , right ? it is called blue ruin . the color . snappy name , huh ?
i like it .
blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering .
yeah . tom waits says it in
exactly ! tom waits . which song ?
i cannot remember .
anyway , this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names . red menace , yellow fever , green revolution . that would be a job , coming up with those names . how do you get a job like that ? that is what i will do . fuck the dole .
i do not really know how
purple haze , pink eraser .
you think that could possibly be a full time job ? how many hair colors could there be ?
someone s got that job . agent orange ! i came up with that one . anyway , there are endless color possibilities and i would be great at it .
i am sure you would .
my writing career ! your hair written by clementine kruczynski . the tom waits album is rain dogs .
you sure ? that does not sound
i think . anyway , i have tried all their colors . more than once . i am getting too old for this . but it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality . i apply my personality in a paste . you ?
oh , i doubt that is the case .
well , you do not know me , so . . . you do not know , do you ?
sorry . i was just trying to be nice .
yeah , i got it .
i am joel .
no jokes about my name ? oh , you would not do that you are trying to be nice .
i do not know any jokes about your name .
huckleberry hound ?
i do not know what that means .
huckleberry hound ! what , are you nuts ?
i am not nuts .
oh my darling , oh my darling , oh my darling clementine ? no ?
sorry . it is a pretty name , though . it means merciful , right ?
yeah . although it hardly fits . i am a vindictive little bitch , truth be told .
see , i would not think that about you .
why would not you think that about me ?
oh . i do not know . i was just . . . i do not know . i was . . . you seemed nice , so
now i am nice ? do not you know any other adjectives ? there s careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative . . . mumpish .
well , anyway . . . sorry .
okay .
shit . shit . i know it is here . hold on .
yes ?
i am sorry i . . . yelled at you . was it yelling ? i cannot really tell . whatever , i am a little out of sorts today .
that is okay .
my embarrassing admission is i really like that you are nice . right now , anyway . i cannot tell from one moment to the next what i am going to like . but right now i am glad you said , that is okay to me . that was nice of you .
it is no problem . anyway , i have some stuff i need to
oh , okay . well , sure , i will just . . . take care , then .
probably see you at the book store .
unless i get that hair color naming job .
no , that is okay . thanks , though .
you are sure ? it is cold .
i do not want to take you out of your way .
it is okay .
yeah ?
you are not a stalker or anything , right ?
well , i probably would not say if i were , but no .
you cannot be too careful . i have been stalked . i have been told i am highly stalkable . i do not need that .
i am not a stalker .
you know wilmont ?
yeah .
wilmont . near the high school .
it is okay . i did not think you were .
i like to read .
me too . it is rain dogs , by the way .
yeah ? i cannot remember that album very well . i remember liking it . but
the song s th and hennepin . i spent most of the train ride trying to remember . till you are full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin and you spill out over the side to anyone who will listen . remember ?
sort of , um . . .
remember ? and you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there and i am lost in the window i hide on the stairway i hang in the curtain i sleep in your hat . . . oh , shit . i am so stupid . sorry .
what ?
i am just a bit of a wreck . i sleep in your hat makes me cry . me .
well , i would not want to be
oh , geez , i am full of shit . i already told you that . anyway . see ya .
hey , do you want to have a drink ? i have lots of drinks . and i could
um
never mind . sorry , that was stupid . i am embarrassed . good night , joel .
very much .
this . . . someone gave that to me , just like , recently . i like it , too . i like crows . i think i used to be a crow .
do you believe in that stuff ? reincarnation ?
i do not know .
me neither . oh , there s an inscription on the back . the way a crow shook down on me the dust of snow from a hemlock tree has given my heart a change of mood and saved some part of a day i rued .
frost ?
yeah . i am not , like , a robert frost lover by any stretch . his stuff seems strictly grade school to me . but this made me cry for some reason . maybe because it is grade school . y know ?
it is pretty .
i miss grade school . i do not know why i am calling it grade school all of a sudden . when i went we called it elementary school . but i like grade school better . sounds like something someone from the forties would call it . i would like to be from then . everyone wore hats . anyway , cheers !
cheers .
i am fine .
yeah ? well , have a seat , anyway .
no , i am okay for now .
you pick it .
you just say . i am not really
i do not know ! i cannot see them from here , joel ! just pick something good .
no , stay . just for a little while . refill ?
no . i
i know a man who needs a refill .
drink up , young man . it will make the whole seduction part less repugnant .
yeah ?
well , i go to a psychic and she is always telling me i am psychic . she should know . do you believe in that stuff ?
i do not know .
me neither . but sometimes i have premonitions , so , i do not know . maybe that is just coincidence . right ? y know , you think something and then it happens , or you think a word and then someone says it ? y know ?
yeah , i do not know . it is hard to know .
exactly . exactly ! that is exactly my feeling about it . it is hard to know . like , okay , but how many times do i think something and it does not happen ? that is what you are saying , right ? you forget about those times . right ?
yeah , i guess .
but i think i am . i like to think i am .
it is helpful to think there s some order to things . you are kind of closed mouthed , are not you ?
sorry . my life is not that interesting . i go to work . i go home . i do not know what to say .
oh . does that make you sad ? or anxious ? i am always anxious thinking i am not living my life to the fullest , y know ? taking advantage of every possibility ? just making sure that i am not wasting one second of the little time i have .
i think about that .
i do have a tendency to use that word too much .
i like you . that is the thing about my psychic thing . i think that is my greatest psychic power , that i get a sense about people . my problem is i never trust it . but i get it . and with you i get that you are a really good guy .
thanks .
and , anyway , you sell yourself short . i can tell . there s a lot of stuff going on in your brain . i can tell . my goal . . . can i tell you my goal ?
yeah .
that is the goal , joel ? my goal , joel , is to just let it flow through me ? do you know what i mean ? it is like , there s all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and i think we are all taught we should be consistent . y know ? you love someone that is it . forever . you choose to do something with your life that is it , that is what you do . it is a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through . and my feeling is that is how you die , because you stop listening to what is true , and what is true is constantly changing . you know ?
yeah . i think so . it is hard to
like i wanted to talk to you . i did not need any more reason to do it . who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist ?
yeah .
you are very nice . god , i have to stop saying that . you are nervous around me , huh ?
no .
i am nervous . you do not need to be nervous around me , though . i like you . do you think i am repulsively fat ?
no , not at all .
i do not either . i used to . but i am through with that . y know , if i do not love my body , then i am just lost . you know ? with all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that is coming round the bend . so , i have been seeing this guy . . .
oh , yeah .
that made me cry . but , anyway , we went up to boston , because i had this urge to lie on my back on the charles river . it gets frozen this time of year .
that is scary sounding .
exactly ! i used to do it in college and i had this urge to go do it again , so i got patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me , but i was really disappointment to be there with him . y know ? and that is where psychic stuff comes in . like , it just is not right with him . y know ?
i think so .
i do not believe in that soulmate crap anymore , but . . . he says so many great things . we like the same writers . this writer stephen dixon he turned me on to . and he is cute . it is fucked up . joel , you should come up to the charles with me sometime .
okay .
yeah ? oh , great !
sounds good . but right now i should go .
you should stay .
i have to get up early in the morning tomorrow , so . . .
okay .
yes .
you will call me , right ?
yeah .
when ?
tomorrow ?
tonight . just to test out the phone lines and all .
okay .
you did not say anything about my hair .
it is three .
. . . a little . i was a little tipsy . do not call me pathetic .
well it is pathetic . and fucking irresponsible . you could have killed somebody .
oh christ i did not kill anybody . it is just a fucking dent . you are like some old lady or something .
no , see , clem , i assume you fucked someone tonight . is not that how you get people to like you ?
fuck you , joel . faggot .
look at it out here . it is falling apart . i am erasing you . and i am happy .
where are you going ?
i am fucking crawling out of my skin .
i want to have a baby .
let s talk about it later .
no . i want to have a baby . i have to have a baby .
i do not think we are ready .
you are not ready .
clementine , do you really think you could take care of a kid ?
i do not want to talk about this here .
joel , we are fucking gonna talk about it !
clem , i am sorry . i should not have
i would make a fucking good mother ! i love children ! i am creative and smart and i would make a fucking good mother !
it is you ! it is you who cannot commit to anything ! you have no idea how lucky you are i am interested in you ! i do not even know why i am ! i should just end it right here , joel . leave you in the zoo . maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with !
would you get me another , joely ?
you are a whiz kid . so perceptive , so
no , it is not that .
i want to know you .
i just do not have anything very interesting about my life .
joel , you are a liar .
no . thanks .
yeah , tangerine ?
do you know the velveteen rabbit ?
no .
it is my favorite book . since i was a kid . it is about these toys . there s this part where the skin horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real . i cannot believe i am crying already . he says , it takes a long time . that is why it does not often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges , or who have to be carefully kept . generally by the time you are real , most of your hair has been loved off , and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby . but these things do not matter at all , because once you are real you cannot be ugly , except to people who do not understand .
yes indeed . fuck ! they are erasing you , clem !
oh ?
i hired them to . we are in my brain . but i want it to stop , before i wake up and do not know you anymore .
wow . um , well . . . cannot you just force yourself awake ?
i do not know .
what do you mean ?
well . . . if they are looking for me in memories i am in , what if you take me to a memory i am not in ? and we can hide there till morning .
i am right here .
i am scared . i want my mommy . i do not want to lose you . i do not want to lose . . .
joel , joely , look . . . it is not fading . the memory . i think we are hidden .
i loved you so much this day . on my bed in your panties . i remember i thought , how impossibly lucky am i to have you on my bed in your panties .
i came over to the bed and you smelled so good , like you just woke up , slightly sweaty . and i climbed on the bed with you and you said something like
another rainy day . whatever shall we do ?
what ?
there s this guy . i heard him talking in my apartment . he is one of the eraser guys . and he fell for you when they were erasing you , so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you are dating him .
really ? is he cute ?
he stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased !
gross ! you must remember to tell me this in the morning . i am , like , so freaked out now .
do not call me antoine . my name is wally .
yes , but i cannot love a man named wally .
hide me somewhere deeper ? somewhere buried ?
this kid , joe early , is going to beat the shit out of me .
i do not like it either , but i am just trying to find horrible secret place to
thanks , joely . a present ! oh boy !
i love it !
yeah .
i want to enjoy my little time left with you .
this is our first date date .
do you remember what we talked about ?
naomi , i guess .
yeah .
what was i wearing ?
god , i should know . your hair was red . i remember it matched the wallpaper .
egad , were you horrified ?
no ! i think you were wearing that black dress , y know , with the buttons .
i will buy that . black s always good .
we did talk about naomi .
i said are you sure ? you seem unsure .
i am sure , i said .
but you were not . i could tell .
i was so nervous . i remember i could not think of anything to say . there were long silences .
so what . infatuation is good , too .
and i did not have an argument .
come up and see me . . . now .
it is very late .
yes , exactly . exactly my point .
is that what you want ?
i did it . i guess that means something .
sorry to track you down like this . i am not a stalker . but i needed to see you .
yeah ?
i would like to . . . take you out or something .
well , you are married .
not yet . not married .
look , man , i am telling you right off the bat , i am high maintenance . so i am not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there . if you want to be with me , you are with me .
okay .
so make your domestic decisions and maybe we will talk again .
i remember that speech really well .
i had you pegged , did not i ?
you had the whole human race pegged .
probably .
i still thought you were going to save me . even after that .
i know .
it would be different , if we could just give it another go around .
remember me . try your best . maybe we can .
hi .
i saw you sitting over here . by yourself . i thought , thank god , someone normal , who does not know how interact at these things either .
yeah . i do not ever know what to say .
i cannot tell you how happy i am to hear that . i mean , i do not mean i am happy you are uncomfortable , but , yknow . . . i am such a loser . every time i come to a party i tell myself i am going to be different and it is always exactly the same and then i hate myself after for being such a clod .
even then i did not believe you entirely . i thought how could you be talking to me if you could not talk to people ?
yeah , i know . i am fishing .
you said
and you picked it out of my plate before i could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers .
i am joel .
yeah , like that .
nope . no jokes . my favorite thing when i was a kid was my huckleberry hound doll . i think your name is magic .
i know .
what do we do ?
enjoy it . say good bye .
i know what you mean . that is why i stopped .
but my sleeping is really fucked up .
i do not think i have slept in a year .
you should try xanax . i mean , it is a chemical and all , but it works . . . and it works just having it around , knowing that it is there . like insurance .
yeah ?
i will give you a couple . see what you think .
okay .
have you ever read any anna akhmatova ?
i love her .
really ? me , too ! i do not meet people who even know who she is and i work in a book store .
i think she is great .
me too . there s this poem
did this conversation come before or after we saw the house ?
i think , before .
seems too coincidental that way .
yeah , maybe .
yeah , yeah . it goes perhaps there is someone in this world to whom i could send all these lines ?
yes ! i love that poem . it breaks my heart . i am so excited you know it . look , houses in which we do not live .
um , no .
let s move into this neighborhood .
oh .
female .
at least i have not been barking up the wrong tree .
what are you doing ?
it is freezing out here .
i hesitated for what seemed like forever .
i could see you wanted to come in , joel .
i knew by your nervousness that naomi was not the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass .
it is dark .
yeah . that is your girlfriend s name ?
naomi .
i think we should go .
no , it is our house ! just tonight we are david and ruth laskin . which one do you want to be ? i prefer to be ruth but i am flexible . alcohol ! you make drinks . i am going find the bedroom and slip into something more ruth . i am ruthless at the moment .
i did . i walked out the door . i felt like i was a scared little kid . i thought you knew that about me . i ran back to the bonfire , trying to outrun my humiliation . you said , so go with such disdain .
what if you stay this time ?
i walked out the door . there s no more memory .
come back and make up a good bye at least . let s pretend we had one .
i love you .
yeah .
when ?
tomorrow ?
tonight . just to test out the phone lines .
yeah .
i do not know .
what if ?
joel , come here . please .
make love ?
have sex . y know
oh , um . . .
because i just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now .
that is okay . i
i am sorry . i just wanted to say that . this seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and
hey , joel
and i am just too nervous around you right now .
i am nervous , too .
yeah ? i would not have thought that .
well , you obviously do not know me .
i am nervous because i have and enormous crush on you .
says you were a bully . . .
a bully ? moi ?
that is what it says . you drank too much , you picked on me for being passive and timid .
well , sounds like me . sorry , man . says you were jealous and suspicious .
says you would sometimes disappear all night , then brag to me about your sexual conquests .
did i use the term sexual conquests or is that your way of putting it .
i do not know .
does not sound like me .
says you were a slob , leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake .
says you were constantly calling me a slob . it is sexy that we were like a married couple , griping and overly familiar and bored . do not you think ?
i sort of do . but i only see it as a fantasy version of reality . cleaned up enough to be erotic .
we should have sex . it is old hat for us .
i cannot stop thinking about you .
yay . meet me after work by the old mill .
what old mill ? is that somewhere we
i just wanted to say that . come by my house .
i just walked in .
hmmm . do you miss me ?
oddly enough , i do .
ha ha ! you said , i do . i guess that means we are married .
i guess so .
tomorrow night . . . honeymoon on ice .
did you send this ? is it a joke ?
i probably got the same thing as you .
i mean , i have not even told anyone i have met you . who would even know to do this ?
maybe it is true then . it is my voice on the tape .
that is what you have to say ? how could it be true ? i never even heard of any procedure like this . it is a joke .
i know . i spoke to my friend magda .
joel , we have fucked . we have made love . like a million times . and we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night . is not that lovely ?
hey , lover . whatcha doing ?
i am just , y know , passing the time best i can till i can see you .
god , i cannot believe i ever hated you .
you must have been crazy .
guess what i am wearing .
i do not know . panties and
your dried cum .
jesus .
hi .
how is it going ?
good . i called you at work today . they said you were home sick .
i know . i had to take the day to think .
yeah , i tried you at home . did you get my message ?
i just got in .
long day thinking .
there you are . naomi , it is just . . . i am afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had . . .
there are two of them . could not make them out . the orange glow of a cigarette .
i am like a joke to them .
maybe i am making a mistake . maybe i just need to learn to live with this . first of all , i will get over it . secondly , it happened . those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it . who said that ? churchill ? i am not sure . but i do not care . she did it to me . i have to rid myself of this . fuck her .
fuck you , clementine .
the pill was pink , i remember . it had some letters and numbers on it . what were they ? al ? al something . four digits . i do not like taking pills when i do not know what they are . i have no choice .
it is too late .
clementine . i should just maybe talk to her .
maybe if i just explain what happened , i would not have to go through this and i could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and . . .
that is your look for me .
oh , god . i miss her . i cannot believe she is with that guy now ! i am never going to see her again . i love her so much . what a fucking monster she is !
i was not going to call her . not after the way she was .
any messages , carmen ?
and what are you like ? a wino ?
is that like us ? are we just bored with each other ?
i loved you on this day . i love this memory . the rain . us just hanging .
i did not want to do this . but i had to or they would have called me a girl .
on the couch . dark . quiet . i wondered if i had made a terrible mistake . i almost reached for the phone about a thousand times . i thought i could take it back , erase it , explain i had momentarily lost my mind . then i told myself we were not happy . that was the truth . that what we were was safe . it was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason . i thought about clementine and the spark when i was with her , but then i thought what you and i had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it was not much fun . but i wanted fun . i saw other people having fun and i wanted it . then i thought fun is a lie , that no one is really having fun i am being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit . . . then i thought maybe not , maybe not . and then i thought , as i always do at this point in my argument , about dying .
this is it . the night we met . my god , it is over .
i remember being drawn to you even then . i thought , i love this woman because she is alone down there looking out at the black ocean .
but i went back to my food . the next thing i remember , i felt someone sitting next to me and i saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye .
next thing i remember we were walking down near the surf .
i could not believe you did that . i was paralyzed with fear .
i did not want to go . i was too nervous . i thought , maybe you were a nut . but you were exciting . you called from upstairs .
is there any sort of risk of brain damage ?
well , technically , the procedure itself is brain damage , but on a par with a night of heavy drinking . nothing you will miss .
well . . . i did .
we can help you through this . why do not you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with clementine .
it was a mess . i do not know how it got this way . . .
you have to stop this !
what ? what do you mean ?
i am trapped in my head and everything i love is being erased ! stop it now !
yes , but . . . i am just something you are imagining . what can i do ? i am in your head , too .
you take it . i do not know .
do not do this to me now , joel . really .
i do not know , i have just been thinking , maybe we are not happy with each other .
what ?
y know , we have been , i do not know , sort of , unhappy with each other and
do not say we when you mean you .
i think maybe , we are both so used to operating at this level that how can one person be unhappy ? if one person is unhappy , both have to be . . . by definition .
bullshit . who is it ? you met someone .
no . i just need some space , maybe .
the thing is , joel , whatever it is you think you have with this chick , once the thrill wears off , you are just going to be joel with the same fucking problems .
it is not somebody else .
hi .
how was it ?
you did not miss much . rob and carrie say hello .
hi , rob and carrie .
go back to sleep .
in a minute .
i have got to finish this chapter anyway .
i hope you get your work done .
yeah .
it is been a pretty lonely couple of years .
i am sorry .
well , it was my fault the break up . i am sorry .
oh , sweetie . it really does cut both ways . we were taking each other for granted and
i miss you .
miss you , too . i have been seeing someone for a little while .
oh ! great . that is great !
a religion instructor at columbia . a good guy . he is a good guy .
i am sorry . i really should not have
i am glad you called .
i do not know . i am not sure there s a big public demand for books on calvinism and misogyny .
i had a good time last night . i really did .
so i am going to get some sleep . i am glad you are okay .
we will speak soon .
night .
hi , mary . how is it going ?
nah , i do not know .
yeah . cool .
the quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts .
very cool . trippy .
i like to read what smart people say . so many beautiful , important things .
i think he will be in bartlett s one day .
hi .
sorry . i just
it is just . . . y know . . . i mean . . .
i know . anyway
anyway , i have got to do my tap dance here .
kay .
hey , if you are ordering lunch for mierzwiak , would you
i better do this , stan .
you found us okay ?
yeah . poor guy . have anything to drink ?
we have not checked .
well , allow me to do the honors . it is fucking freezing and i need something .
that is a good one .
yeah , i cannot wait to tell howard ! it seems really appropriate .
it is a good one all right .
do not you think howard s like that ? smart ? important ?
yup .
go .
yeah .
to let people begin again . it is beautiful . you look at a baby and it is so fresh , so clean , so free . and adults . . . they are like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness . . . hopelessness . and howard just makes it go away .
you love him , do not you ?
what ?
listen , it is not erasing .
where ?
i do not know . he is not on the map .
well , what should we do ?
i do not know ! i just said that !
sor ry we have to do something . he cannot wake up half done .
shit !
this guy s only half cooked . there s no time to fuck around , stan .
you better go .
hell no .
do you swear you did not know ?
i swear .
and you never even suspected ? never saw us behaving in any unusual way together ?
once , maybe .
how did i look ?
happy . happy with a secret .
i never saw you together like that again . so i figured i was imagining things .
do you remember anything else ? what i was wearing ? was i standing close to him ? was i leaning against his car like i owned it ? how did he look at me when i giggled ? tell me everything .
you were in red . that red sweater with the little flowers , i think . you were leaning against his car . he looked a little like a kid . kind of goofy and wide eyed . i would never seen him look like that before . happy . you looked beautiful . you looked in love .
thanks , stan .
hi .
what do you want , stan ?
can i . . . i brought some
nothing .
i know what it is .
then why did you ask me ?
i do not know . i just there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office .
they have a right to know . howard is a thief . he steals the truth . i cannot remember my baby ! i cannot remember my baby . it existed and i cannot even remember . do you understand that ?
i will not allow it . those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it . what do you think of that ? that is from my quote book .
the office is filled with people who want their memories re erased .
remember the alamo ! remember the alamo !
mary . . . please . this is hurting people .
thanks , mary . you can bring her in .
yes ?
order me a pastrami for after ?
cole slaw , ice tea ?
thanks .
welcome , howard .
that was beautiful to watch , howard . like a surgeon or a concert pianist .
well , thank you , mary .
how do you mean ?
oh , um , like famous quotes . i find reading them inspirational to me . and in my reading i have come across some i thought you might like , too .
oh . well , i would love to hear some .
is that nietzsche ?
yeah , yeah it is , howard . and here i was thinking i could tell you something you did not know .
it is a good quote , mary . i am glad we both know it .
alexander pope ?
yes , shit . oops , sorry ! sorry . it is just i told myself i was not going to say pope alexander and sound like a dope and then i go ahead and do it . like i psyched myself out .
it is no big deal .
you are such a sweetheart .
really ? i thought it was appropriate maybe . that is all . i really admire the work that you do . i know it is not proper to be so familiar but i guess since we are outside the workplace i feel a certain liberty to
it is fine , mary . i am happy to hear it .
okay . good . great . thanks . i like you , howard . . . an awful lot . is that terrible ?
i have got a wife , mary . kids . you know that .
i wish i was your wife . i wish i had your kids .
no you are right . once again . you are a decent man , howard .
we . . . have a history . i am sorry . you wanted the procedure . you wanted it done . . . to get past . i have to finish in there . it is almost morning . we will talk later .
i do not know what i am supposed say , mary . i want to do the right thing here .
do you love me ? did you love me ? something . i listened to my tape . i cannot believe i have been sitting right in front of it for a year . it is like listening to someone else s story . i mean , i hear myself talking about having sex with you and i cannot even imagine you naked . i cannot even say naked to you !
i have a family , mary .
you made me have an abortion .
it was a mutual decision .
you made me have you erased ! i loved you . i love you ! how could you
i did not make you . you thought it best . but , look , i take full responsibility .
the guy we are doing ? he is disappeared from the map . i cannot find him anywhere .
okay , what happened right before he disappeared ?
i was away from the monitor for a second . i had it on automatic . i had to go pee .
well , where was patrick ?
he went home sick .
jesus . all right , that is the address .
sherman drive . apartment e , rockville center .
december th , . i met someone tonight . oh , christ i do not know what to do . her name is clementine and she is amazing . so alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive . things with naomi and i have been stagnant for so long .
she came to help , howard .
did you try going through c gate ?
yeah . of course .
yeah , probably a good idea .
oh dear .
that is fine , stan .
thanks , stan . thanks .
i do not know what you are talking about , howard .
mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people .
jesus .
hi , i was in the neighborhood and thought i would see
i think he is in a conference . unfortunately . i am really sorry .
would you just try him ? you never know . as long as i am here . you never know .
of course . please have a seat .
maybe after the holidays then .
then check the connections .
yeah , that looks better . thanks .
not a dump , then , but kind of plain . uninspired . and there s a stale smell . sort of stuffy . i do not know . stuffy .
patrick , let s just get through this . we have a long night ahead of us .
yeah .
just wanted to let you know .
i like mary . i like when she comes to visit . i just do not think she likes me .
she likes you okay .
i wonder if i should invite my girlfriend over , too . i have a girlfriend now .
you can if you want .
did i tell you i have a new girlfriend ?
this one s history . moving on . . .
the thing is . . . my situation is a little weird . my girlfriend situation .
patrick , we need to focus .
she was unconscious , patrick .
she was beautiful . so sweet and funky and voluptuous . i kind of stole a pair of her panties , is what .
jesus , patrick !
maybe if you stopped stealing their panties .
okay , there s more , stan
it is a quote book .
patrick , we are in the middle of
she is right in the neighborhood . she is upset .
thanks , stan . i owe you .
i know who you are .
oh ? well , there s been some trouble on the ranch . i came up here to get out of the way . it is so dark now i doubt if i could find my way back down . if you could help . . .
save your breath for the climb .
neither do i . . . ha ha ho ho hee hee .
clockworks .
clockworks ?
siwash , huh ?
he was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer , and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far away siwash ridge . i came to the dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own .
the clock people ?
then if you are japanese , then why are you called the chink ?
the clock people mistook me for chinese . and the name stuck . in the same way that all indian tribes came to be labeled indians through the ignorance of an italian sailor with a taste for oranges , it is only fitting that indians misnamed me . the clock people , however , are not a tribe , rather they are a gathering of indians from various tribes . they have lived together since .
ha ha ho ho and hee hee .
yes , everything is getting worse . but everything is also getting better .
the countess has come to our aid . the rubber rose ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls . and i have been asked to oversee the ranch . for a week . and as it turns out , the countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was . . . here s a picture !
she had a one way ticket to kansas city .
you mean she is dead ?
easy come , easy go .
the world is not going to end , you dummy i hope you know that much . but it is going to change . it is going to change drastically , and probably in your lifetime . the clock people see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change , and they may be right , since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue . but there are far worse catastrophes coming . . . unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization , in other words , unless it can break the consumption habit and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption . it is not merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes , but that our operative political economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault . so the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan , all right , but there will be some of us it will miss . little pockets of humanity . like the clock people . like you two honeys , if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on siwash cave . there s almost no worldwide calamity famine , nuclear accident , plague , weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield that you could not survive in that cave .
how am i going to be the progenitor of a tribe when i am living on an isolated ridgetop with delores ?
that is your problem .
i am staying with the countess .
i know , but where do you reside when you are not visiting new york ?
i do not .
you do not ?
well , no , i do not reside anywhere in particular . i just keep moving .
you might say that , although i do not think of it as traveling .
oh , rupert and carla had a little hassle and went home .
er , you seem to know who i am , and maybe even what i am . thanks for the breakfast .
oh , i know about sissy hankshaw , all right . i have done a little hitchhiking myself . ah shucks , that is like telling annie oakley you are a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone . i would heard tales about you from people i would meet in jail cells and truckstops . i heard about your , uh , your , ah , your wonderful thumbs , and i heard how you were jack kerouac s girl friend . . .
well , that does not matter that part never interested me anyway . the beatnicks were before my time , and i never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope , clichs and the clap . but the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl .
about . . .
about being a cowgirl . that is it all about ? when you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl .
cowgirls exist as an image . a fairly common image . the idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture . therefore , it seems to me , the existence of cowgirls should prevail . otherwise , they are being fooled . in the rodeo hall of fame in oklahoma city there are just two cowgirls . two . and both of em are trick riders . trick riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos . our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks . that is what prostitutes call it , you know tricking .
no , ma am . no way . there s girls on the rubber rose who are political , but i do not share their views . i got no cowgirl ideology to expound . politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it .
really ? the chink , huh ? i have gathered that you sometimes speak with him . what else have you learned from the chink ?
learned from the chink ? oh my . ha ha . that is hard to say . we mostly . . . . uh , a lot of his talk is pretty goofy .
what is debbie s position ?
debbie says that if women are to take charge again , they must do it in the feminine way they must not resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods . she says it is up to women to show themselves better than men , to love men , set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the new age . she is a real dreamer , that debbie dear .
you do not agree with debbie , then ?
i would not say that . i expect she is right , ultimately . but i am with delores when it comes to fighting for that is mine . i cannot understand why delores is so uptight about the chink he could probably teach her a thing or two . ee ! that grass tickles , does not it ? god knows i love women , but nothing can take the place of a man that fits . still this is cowgirl territory and i will stand with delores and fight any bastards who might deny it . i guess i have always been a scrapper . look . this scar . only twelve years old and i was felled by a silver bullet .
from men , the whooping crane has received neither love nor respect . men have drained the crane s marshes , stolen its eggs , invaded its privacy , polluted its food , fouled its air , blown it apart with buckshot .
so be it . it looks serious this time , though . all these guns . . . are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes ?
hell no , the cranes are wonderful , okay , but i am not in this for whooping cranes . i am in it for cowgirls . if we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue , then cowgirls become just another compromise . i want a finer fate than that for me and for every other cowgirl . better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised .
how did this business get started , anyhow ? why are the birds nesting here ?
wouldrugged is a stupid word .
but the peyote is obviously affecting their brains . it is made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years .
if i flinch when you say you love me , it is both our problems . my confusion becomes your confusion . students confuse teachers , patients confuse psychiatrists , lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts . . . .
she is obviously that . jesus ! which would you rather have , a million dollars or one of sissy s thumbs full of pennies ?
oh , you ! i am not talking about her hands . they are difficult to ignore , i confess , but i am speaking of her whole being . her whole being is extraordinary . the way she talks , for example . she is so articulate .
it is high time you realized , honey babe , that a woman does not have to give the best years of her life to radcliffe or smith in order to speak the english language .
countess . i am really in a dither . she is turned my head .
ninety degrees to the left , i hope . how does she feel about you ?
i think she is disappointed that i am not more , ah , sort of atavistic . she is got some naive , sentimental notions about indians . i am sure she liked me , though but . . . . then she left town .
she always leaves town , you dummy . that does not mean anything . what about in bed ? how does she like it in bed ?
like what ?
well . . . . er . . .
shit o dear , julian . do you mean to tell me you did not get it on ?
oh , we did not get it all the way on .
whose fault was that ?
i suppose it was mine . yes , it definitely was my fault .
what do they do to you boys in those ivy league schools , anyway ? strap you down and pump the nature out of you ? they can even press the last drop of nature out of a mohawk buck . why , send a shaman or cannibal to yale for four years and all he would be fit for would be a desk in the military industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a neil simon comedy . jesus h . m . s . christ ! if harvard or princeton could get hold of the chink for a couple of semesters they would turn him into a candidate for the bow tie wing of the hall of wimps . oogie boogie .
if we ivy leaguers are not earthy enough to suit you hillbillies , at least we do not go around indulging in racist terms such as chink . next thing i know , you will be calling me chief .
chink s the guy s name , for christ s sake .
what guy ?
aw , he is some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out west . gives my ranch the creeps and the willies , too . but though he be old and dirty , he is alive , i will bet , clear down to his toes . they do not have his juice in a jar in new haven . well i suppose that i will have to write sissy out on the road .
here . i will turn down the air conditioner .
it is not the air conditioner that is making me cold . nothing moves in here . not even your birds .
getting dressed . i have got to go .
but i do not want you to leave . please stay . we can go to dinner . i owe you a dinner . and tonight . . . we can . . . really make love .
i have to go , julian .
why ? why do you have to go ?
my thumbs hurt . i have made a mistake . i have been negligent . i have not exercised . i have to hitchhike a little bit every day , no matter what . it is like a musician practicing his scales . when i do not practice , my timing gets off , my thumbs get stiff and sore .
you bet your raggedy white ass i am .
american cheese . the king of road food .
i was a successful model once .
for magazines ?
i was the yoni yum feminine hygiene dew girl from to , but got laid off .
so now you are bumming around ?
yep .
hitchhiking ?
i am the best .
you are the best ?
when i was younger , i hitchhiked one hundred and twenty seven hours without stopping , without food or sleep , crossed the continent twice in six days , cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways .
whooee !
as i developed , however , i grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style . time in terms of m . p . h . no longer interested me . i began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time slow , ancient , vast . when i am really moving , stopping car after car after car , moving so freely , so clearly , so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass , then i embody the rhythms of the universe . i am in a state of grace .
tired . . .
that is the very first time in the eons that i have known you that i have ever heard you complain . and now you are tired , poor darling .
a born freak can only go uphill .
freak , schmeek . most of us are freaks in one way or another . try being born a male russian countess into a white middle class baptist family in mississippi and you will see what i mean .
i have always been proud of the way nature singled me out . it is the people who have been deformed by society i feel sorry for . i have been steady moving for eleven years and some months . maybe i should rest up for a spell , i am not as young as i used to be .
shit o goodness , you will not be thirty for another year , and you are more beautiful than ever .
does that mean you might have an assignment for me ?
bonanza jellybean ?
what ? oh yes . tee hee . jellybean .
your ranch ?
oh my dear yes , i bought a little ranch out west , sort of a tribute to the women of america who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products , dew spray mist and yoni yum spray powder . a tax write off , actually .
a job for me ?
i am once more about to make advertising history . and only you , the original yoni yum dew girl , could possibly assist me .
shit o dear , that is enough to make me asthmatic . the nerve of those twits . what do they know about female odor ? do not interrupt . here s my concept . my ranch out west ? it is a beauty ranch . oh , it is got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes . but it is a beauty ranch , a place where unhappy women divorcees and widows , mainly can go to lose weight , remove wrinkles , change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment . my ranch is named the rubber rose , after the rubber rose douche bag , my own invention , and bless its little red bladder , the most popular douche bag in the world . so get this . it is on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes . the last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence . well , these cranes stop off at my little pond siwash lake , it is called twice a year , autumn and spring , and spend a few days each time , resting up , eating , doing whatever whooping cranes do . i have never seen them , understand , but i hear they are magnificent . very big specimens i mean , huge mothers and white as snow , to coin a phrase , except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers , and bright red heads . now , whooping cranes , in case you did not know it , are noted for their mating dance . it is just the wildest show in nature . it is probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons . picture these rare , beautiful , gigantic birds in full dance leaping six feet off the mud , arching their backs , flapping their wings , strutting low to the ground . dears , it is overwhelming . and picture the birds doing their sex dance on tv . right there on the home screen , creationgs most elaborate sex ritual yet clean and pure enough to suit the pope . with lovely sissy hankshaw in the foreground . in a white gown , red hood attached , and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black . in a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane , she dance walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of yoni yum . and a can of dew . off camera , a string quartet is playing debussy . a sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love . are you starting to get it ? does not it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud ? my very goodness gracious ! grandiose , lyrical , erotic and girl scout oriented you cannot top it . i have hired a crew of experts from walt disney studios , the best wildlife cinematographers around . you are my eternal favorite . princess grace herself could not be better , not even if she had your personality which she does not anyway , dear , i am out of photography now and into water colors . ah how circuitous conversation is ! we are back at the beginning . the exact man i have wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist .
purely personal . i believe you might enjoy one another .
but countess . . .
now , now . do not get exasperated . i realize that you have always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men , and i might add , you have been wise . heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage . for men , marriage is a matter of efficient logistics the male gets his food , bed , laundry , tv , pussy , offspring and creature comforts all under one roof , where he does not have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much , then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life , which is what existence is all about . but for a woman marriage is surrender .
why , yes , technically . jack kerouac and i came awfully close , but he was afraid of me , i think . . .
yes , well , what i am getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity . she cannot wait too long , you know . now , there s no reason why you must lose yours . i mean , just ponder it a bit , that is all .
what makes you think this watercolorist and i would develop a romantic relationship ?
i cannot be certain that you would . but what have you got to lose ?
well , okay . i will try it . i do not see the point in it , but i will try it . just for you . it is kind of silly , actually , me going out with an artist in new york city . however . . .
good , good , good . . . you will enjoy it , you will see . julian is a gentleman .
i do not know anything about it .
sissy . you are trying to protect those scuzzy bitches . well , let your conscience be your guide , as my mommy used to say , but it will not work . those stinking sluts are going to suffer . . .
i am your best friend . i am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker . . .
i heard it .
so if the ship did not blow up , what happened ?
i would rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it . now step aside , old man .
uh , yeah coop , i am still here .
shit ! do not do that ! where the fuck are you ?
i am in the second containment area . it is pitch black in here . there must have been a coolant leak . man , this shit is everywhere . i cannot see a damn thing .
justin ?
i think i found something . . .
do not start with me , cooper .
you can call him baby bear , he loves that . . .
this is cooper , what the hell do you do on this ship , anyway ?
everybody shut up ! let the man speak .
you are convinced the crew could still be alive ? after seven years ?
you have had plenty eva , coop , it is justings turn . stay on station . if anything happens . . .
i will be all over it .
coop , where are you . . .
the containment , second containment . . .
hold on , coop . . .
i will get him .
on my way .
you prep the gravity couches . i am going to manually arm those explosives .
will it work ?
it worked for weir . prep the tanks .
i would rather spend the next twelve hours outside than another five minutes in this can . this ship is bad . it watches you .
what ?
you heard me . this ship , it is crazy trying to go faster n light , that is like the tower of babel .
shit , smith , you are going biblical on me .
you know what happened to the tower of babel , do not you ? it fell down .
you are sucking too much nitrogen in your mix .
what about the accumulator . . . ?
we are still venting trace gasses , gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole .
smith , clear that airlock , man , i am coming in .
roger that .
what ?
coffee .
no , thank you .
skipper , do we get hazard pay for this ?
no , he did not .
you were not there . i saw it .
saw what , mr . cooper ? what did you really see , because what you are describing is not physically possible . . .
i am telling you , i saw it . . .
what you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion .
i know what i saw and it was not a fucking optical effect !
it is not .
i do not know , the screens are dead . . . !
you are okay now , it is over . . .
there must be a way ! what about engineering ?
can you shut it down ?
i do not know the process , dr . weir was the expert . . .
i do not want to go where the last crew went . i would rather be dead .
hurry .
run !
trauma .
and this is mission specialist dr . william weir . we all know where we are going . dr . weir is going to tell us why .
no time . we need whatever s left in our suits to repair the clark . like it or not , this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers .
his vitals are stable , but he is unresponsive to stimuli . he might wake up in fifteen minutes . he might not wake up at all .
goddammit , dj , it was not a hallucination ! i saw a man , he was on fire . and then he disappeared .
i do not need sleep , dj . i need answers .
we will make it .
another man ? who ?
no .
i have been listening to the transmission . and i think houston made a mistake in the translation .
go on .
it is not a distress call . it is a warning .
it gets worse .
hear what ?
it sounds like ex infera ex , from infera , the ablative case of inferi . hell .
save yourself . from hell . what are you saying , are you saying that this ship is possessed ?
no . i do not believe in that sort of thing . but if dr . weir is right , this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe , of reality . who knows where this ship has been . . . what it is seen . . . and what it is brought back with it .
what happened ?
weir . he used one of the explosives from the corridor .
oh , god , dj , what do i . . . how do i . . .
please . . . kill . . .
oh god . . .
nothing . it is nothing .
a power drain
you did not hear it ? you must have heard it !
pressure ?
over and falling . . . .
he is crashing . . .
his peritoneum has ruptured . . .
one thing at a time , let s keep him breathing . start the drip , cc s fibrinogen , christ , he is bleeding out . . .
i apologize for the short notice , bill , but we have had something come up that requires your immediate attention . lyle ?
i would not bring you here on a hoax . houston confirms the telemetry and i . d . codes .
it is the event horizon . she is come back .
a written briefing cannot possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this . i have to go with them .
thank you .
do not thank me , bill . i am not doing you any favors .
navigation control tried to hail the vessel . this was the only response .
you do not just dismiss bill weir . the man held oppenheimer s chair at princeton . if the event horizon had worked , he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since einstein .
the official inquiry blamed weir s design for the ship s loss .
that does not mean a damn thing . they were looking for a scapegoat and weir fit the bill . but he is not responsible for what happened to the ship .
does he know that ?
that is on your mind ?
he does not belong on this mission . responsible or not , he blames himself . he is too close to it . and then there s his wife .
it is been two years since she died . he is over it .
some things you do not get over .
the lewis and clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt , she is docked in bay four .
it will not stop , it goes on and on and on . . .
what does ?
the dark inside me .
the dark inside . . . ? i do not understand .
from the other place . . .
starck !
how do you know all this ?
i built it .
we still have pressure . the radiation count s steady at millirads an hour .
background radiation . perfectly safe .
that is the second containment seal . beyond that , engineering .
i am going in .
start the countdown .
yes , sir !
almost done , i just gotta check one thing . . .
justin .
skipper , you gotta help me . . .
you are not going to die ! not today ! i want you to do exactly as i say and i am gonna get you out of there , alright ?
but i cannot . . . i gotta get out of here . . . skipper , please . . .
justin . i will not let you die .
dr . weir , admiral hollis would like to see you as soon as possible .
i designed the ship s propulsion system . i am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive . you cannot send a search and rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed . that would be like . . . like sending an auto mechanic to work on the shuttle .
i can understand your desire to redeem your reputation , dr . weir , but it does not factor into this .
this is not about my reputation ! this is not about me at all ! the event horizon was created for one reason to go faster than light . imagine mankind exploring new solar systems , colonizing new worlds . seven years ago , we did not just lose the ship and the crew . we lost the dream . i have to go .
the crew ? could they still be alive ?
the ship had life support systems for eighteen months . they are been gone seven years .
someone sent that message . admiral , you have to put me on that ship .
just loading the last of the co scrubbers . good for four months .
i put in for a replacement for you but no one . . .
no , no , its alright . i talked to my ex , he will keep denny over christmas and i will get him this summer . goddam it , skipper . . . i have not seen him in two months .
i am sorry . but now we have to go to work .
clear and open on my mark . three . . . two . . . one . . . mark .
ice crystals everywhere . this place is a deep freeze .
so where are they ? starck , any luck with the bio scan ?
i do not know , this place is really dark , i cannot see a thing . . .
starck , you still showing those readings ?
there s no one here , skipper .
what you got , peters ?
the science workstation has power , i will see if i can find the crew from here .
alive ?
frozen .
. . . how is the client ?
crystallized .
skipper . . .
peters . . .
. . . you okay ?
yeah . i am i am okay .
i can use the station in medical , keep an eye on justin . . .
fine . starck , i want you to repeat the bio scan . . .
do it .
justin .
i will get back to the log . but on the bridge , i will not go back , back in there . . .
thanks .
the clock is running , dr . weir . if you will follow the rest of the crew , they will show you to the gravity tanks .
doctor weir , my crew is not going on your mission because we want to . we were pulled off a well deserved leave , to be sent out to the middle of nowhere , and no one s even told us why .
i have been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach neptune space .
until then , do what you are told and stay out of my way .
where has it been for the last seven years ?
that is what we are here to find out .
nsa encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message . . .
smith , use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster .
be careful . it is not a load bearing structure . . .
captain , i did not come out here to sit on your bridge , i need to be on that ship . . .
once the ship is secured , we will bring you on board
that is not acceptable
once we have secured the ship , that is the way it is ! i need you to guide us from the comm station . this is where i need you . help us to do our job .
peters and i will search the forward decks . justin , take engineering . no hot dogging , not on this one , alright ?
in an emergency , the charges detonate in series , destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship . that way , if the gravity drive malfunctions , the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat .
captain miller , the foredecks are just ahead .
negative .
they are empty , dr . weir . moving forward .
dr . weir s right . get on board the event horizon . i will meet you at the airlock .
one of my men is down . i want to know what happened to him .
it is possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the core , distorting space time . they could be what hit the lewis and clark .
what could cause them ? that is in the core ?
it is complicated . . .
how much time do you need ? we have seventeen hours and forty two minutes . now what is in the core ?
insane ? the finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship . it would take the lewis and clark a thousand years to reach our closest star . the event horizon could be there in a day . . .
if it worked .
if it worked , yes .
there s no danger . the black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields , it is under control .
your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart . it may have killed one of my men . no one goes near that thing .
the date .
what about it ?
the event horizongs computer think s it is .
it is . . .
exactly . the ship s internal clock is off by seven years .
intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time , it is possible . . . black holes make sense on paper , it is all math , you see , but as to what really happened . . . the event horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality , and like lazarus , returned from the dead .
i do not know .
the core . . . !
check the core for radiation . carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries .
i think i can stabilize the fields around the singularity , that should prevent another power drain .
do it .
justin just tried to kill himself . the man is clearly insane .
thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly , causing reverberations
that is bullshit and you know it ! you built this fucking ship and all i have heard from you is bullshit !
what do you want me to say ?
you said this ship creates a gateway . . .
yes . . .
to what ? where did this ship go ? where did you send it ?
i do not know . . .
where has it been for the past seven years ?
i do not know . . .
the other place , what is that . . . ?
i do not know ! i do not know . there s a lot of things going on here that i do not understand . truth takes time .
that is exactly what we do not have , doctor .
you cannot , your orders are specific . . .
. . . to rescue the crew and salvage the ship . the crew is dead , dr . weir . this ship killed them . and now it is killing us .
you are insane . you have lost your mind .
maybe you are right . but it is still my command , and i have leeway to abort when i feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew . and i think there is . starck , download all the files from the event horizongs computers . coop , smith , finish moving the co scrubbers back onto the clark .
do not . . . do not do this . . .
it is done .
we will take the lewis and clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the event horizon until i am satisfied that she has been destroyed . fuck this ship .
you . . . you cannot do that !
watch me .
just get your gear back onto the lewis and clark , doctor , or you will find yourself looking for a ride home .
son of a bitch !
i do not need them anymore . where we are going , we will not need eyes to see .
what are you talking about ?
do you know what a singularity is , miller ? does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is ? it is nothing . absolute and eternal nothing . and if god is everything , then i have seen the devil . it is a liberating experience .
what makes you think i will miss ?
then who the fuck are you ?
your fear . do you remember the goliath , miller ?
you know .
you want me to believe you are the devil , well , i do not , that is bullshit !
i am not the devil .
then what , what are you ? tell me . . .
better if i just show you .
you are lying . . . !
i am not asking you to believe me . you will see for yourself . . . and so will your crew . you are all coming with me .
starck . . . cooper . . .
nooo !
locked and cocked .
what is that ?
. . . make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees . . .
one four degrees . . .
bring us in tight . starck , get on the horn , see if anyone s listening . . .
that is not it . that ship was built to go faster than light . . . that is just wrong , it goes against everything we know . . .
what are you trying to say ? if god had intended man to fly , he would have given us wings ?
something like that , yeah .
yes , sir .
dr . weir . . . !
i noticed . starck , anybody home ?
where is it ?
starck . . .
love to .
starck , give me a read .
smith , where the hell have you been ? !
we have a situation here . . .
we do not have time to fart .
we are losing pressure at liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked . in three minutes , our atmosphere will be gone . we are fucking dead .
no one s dying on my watch , smith ! what about the reserve tanks ?
they are gone .
you heard me , smith . peters , are you with me ?
i am here , smith , how is the clark ?
i have found a six inch fracture in the outer hull . we should be able to repair it and re pressurize , it is gonna take some time .
we do not have time , smith . in twenty hours we run out of air .
understood .
that is enough !
get outside , go back to work . i will join you shortly .
captain , we got a problem .
now what ?
she was right behind me , i turn around , she is gone . she could be anywhere .
alright . prep the clark for launch . i will find her .
what is it , smith ?
i just saw weir , i think he was messing around on the clark .
come again , skipper ?
one of the explosives is missing from the corridor . i think weir may have put it on the clark .
no , no , we just got her back together . . .
get out of there now !
smith ? smith ! fuck !
justin ?
let s go .
i just finished drying . . .
then what are you doing here ? come on , people , let s go ! and cooper . . . put some pants on .
come around to three three four . . .
radiation interference ?
there s not enough radiation to throw off the scan . i am picking up trace life forms , but i cannot get a lock on the location .
keep your eyes open .
we are all here .
okay . let s find out how much time we just bought .
but you can breathe it .
how much oh two do we have ?
oxygen is not the problem .
carbon dioxide ?
it is building up with every breath we take . and the co filters on the event horizon are shot .
we can take the filters from the clark . . .
i thought of that , with the filters from the clark , we have got enough breathable air for twenty hours . after that , we would better be on our way home .
what about the life readings you picked up ?
the event horizon sensors show the same thing bio readings of indeterminate origin . right before that wave hit the clark , there was some kind of surge , right off the scale , but now it is back to its previous levels .
that is causing the readings ?
i do not know , but whatever it is , it is not the crew .
so where is the rest of the crew ? we have been over every inch of this ship and all we have found is blood . dr . weir ? any suggestions ?
not acceptable . i want to know that is causing those readings . if the crew is dead , i want the bodies , i want the crew found .
i can reconfigure the scan for c , amylase proteins .
do it . dr . weir . . .
no . it was someone else .
who ?
dr . weir , you were right there , you must have heard something , seen something . . .
what is it , starck ?
. . . i ran the bio scan with the dna rna filter . the results were bio readings of indeterminate origin . . .
. . . bio readings of indeterminate origin , do not you have anything useful to tell me ?
i have got a theory .
there was a another surge in the bio readings right before you . . . you saw what you saw . we picked up a similar readings right before the clarke was damaged . what if there were a connection between the two ? the gravity waves , the hallucination , all part of an defensive reaction , like an immune system . . .
to what ? what are you saying ? this ship is alive ?
i did not say that , i said the bio readings correspond to what happened to you , the ship is reacting to us . . .
we are hanging on by our fingernails and you are giving me bullshit stories . . .
starck , do you know how crazy that sounds ? it is impossible .
i know that .
i thought you wanted an answer . and that is the only one i have .
nine hours and twenty two minutes .
i am going outside to work on the clark . and starck . . . do not tell anyone what you just told me . we have got enough to worry about .
that is going on in there , starck ?
justings in the airlock .
he is awake , he is in the airlock , he is not wearing a suit .
stay here ! do not stop working !
you better hurry . he is engaged the override , we cannot open the inner door .
five seconds .
whatever was on that bridge was not weir .
we have got to shut it down , we have got to . . .
blow it up ?
we blow the corridor . use the foredecks as a lifeboat , separate it from the rest of the ship . we stay put . . .
no . i will be right back .
. . . repeat , we are armed . . .
miller , he is back , he was in the tank . . .
he is dead . . .
yes .
he is been past mars ?
he served on the goliath .
was not that ship destroyed ?
they attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for titan . the shuttle s oh two tanks ruptured during the rescue , flooded both ships with pure oxygen . there was a spark and both ships were incinerated . the skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat . captain miller was able . . .
dj ! it is okay . you are okay . just breathe .
they are explosive charges .
you are at the bridge , ms . peters . you still have not seen any crew ?
blood . looks like arterial spray .
can you see a body ?
there s no one here .
i did .
is not it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge ?
i have seen bodies before . this is different .
not according to the computer .
can you shut it down ?
keep him talking .
do you know what it was ?
come on , baby bear , open this door . . .
skipper , justin just activated the door . it is on a thirty second delay . . .
it is cold .
i do not care .
say this paper represents space time , and you want to get from point a here . . . . . . to point b , here . now that is the shortest distance between two points ?
dead ahead , meters .
she is not ugly .
shit , doc , any closer and we are gonna need a rubber . . .
that is the core the gravity drive . the heart of the ship .
we are losing atmosphere . . .
it still has air and reserve power , we can activate gravity and life support .
thank you for that scientific analysis , mister smith .
hey ! you do not need to be a scientist figure it out . . .
smith s right . neptune ? there s nothing out there . if something happens , we will be on our own .
all boards are green , everything s five by five .
the law of relativity prohibits faster than light travel . . .
matching speed . . . now . range to target ten thousand meters and closing . . . skipper , i got a bad feeling about this . . .
range meters and closing .
meters . . .
picking up magnetic interference .
explosive decompression .
decompression would not do that .
get them back
i am trying , goddammit
i do not think this is a good idea , we do not even know what happened on that ship . . .
how ?
well , in laymangs terms , you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons these in turn fold space time consistent with weyl tensor dynamics until the space time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity . . .
wrong . the shortest distance between two points . . .
do they have pressure ?
affirmative . the hull s intact . . . but there s no gravity and the thermal units are off line . i am showing deep cold . the crew could not survive unless they were in stasis .
if they were in stasis , i would get a location , but these readings , they are all over the ship . it does not make any sense .
ship s log .
i do not know . the life readings just went off the scale .
i cannot believe we built this .
hmmm . claire used to tell me i loved the event horizon more than i loved her . i told her that was not true , i just knew the event horizon better , that is all .
claire is your wife ?
yes .
it must be hard , being so far away from her .
yes . i miss her . she died . two years now .
i am sorry .
no , there s no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind . it is as if time just . . . stopped for seven years .
it wants me . i have to go .
i am alright . please .
the forward airlock .
miller , smith , cooper , any of you in the airlock ?
it means nothing .
you would not say that , if you could see me .
trust me , this ai not one of those times .
i am blind , not deaf . wanna come in ?
relax , it is casual .
no , i mean . . . i am a little . . . dusty . . .
my step dad s . i am strictly into stone . i was wondering when you would walk by .
i like the sound of that .
sensual blind chick seeks three ton , rock hard he man for deep spiritual relationship .
this ai not permanent . my friend reed s working on a cure . . . i think .
i would not know anything about that .
i mean . . .
tell me . when you grew up in brooklyn , how many astronauts did you know ? you went your own way then . you did not listen to people . so why start now . . . ?
i will schedule the launch . call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew .
victor did .
is it safe ?
would not want to keep vic waiting .
well why did not you say so ? you want me to lift some weights or something ?
the suit will stretch . you should try it
i would not be caught dead in that .
oh , he did .
what did he do to the uniform ? !
it is not him . it is them . i cannot live like this .
just give reed a little more time . you know how he works analyzing every little step before he takes one
it is easy for you to be patient .
no , it is not . i thought i was done waiting for reed . . . we are all in this together now , ben .
victor must have taken him .
i am worried about you .
about me ? how sweet .
come on . let me buy you something to eat . looks like you could use the company .
what is this ? where is reed ?
where do you think ? with sue .
to help you . i have run every test known to man . and they all yield the same result the machine is ready .
he also said we would avoid that storm in space . and we know how that turned out .
and you can ? power it up ?
just get back soon , or i start looking for a new groom .
i do not care about rocks , i care about you . you bring him back in one piece , or you can forget being best man .
out front ? you home , baby ? i got a surprise for you .
do not come any closer for a sec . this is gonna be kind of a shock . . . you remember when we said together forever no matter what ?
baby , you are scaring me .
deb , it is me . it is still me .
i already got it . everything i want .
this was not our first stop , in case you forgot nasa . and victor s not that bad . he is just a little . . . larger than life .
you would never know it .
ben . this is business . just work .
ben , the money s not important . we could save lives .
ben , think about all the people we can help if this works
maybe you should think about yourself for once . you always let this guy push you round
we got what we wanted . that is enough .
i know , i know . i am just worried about what he wants . . . speaking of which . . .
external srbs , orbital system engines . its just like the shuttles you flew in
no . i cannot take orders from that underwear model . that wingnut washed out of nasa for sneaking two victoria secret wannabes into a flight simulator .
youthful high spirits .
i am sure he is matured since then .
five times .
i had it at four .
this makes five .
he is made a few changes .
this is your dream , reed . you should be the one up there .
victor s better at these things .
should ?
ben . this is serious . turn around .
three days . i was worried about you . how are you feeling ?
solid .
reed . even you cannot compute every little thing .
i should have done more , run more tests
yeah , you and debbie and perfect
reed , i am not talking about debbie .
i am sorry , did that cosmic bath loosen your screws ?
he is smart , powerful , successful
well maybe you should date him .
i think i need to lie down . bad shrimp .
ben . are you okay ?
am i okay ? ! you wanna explain that ? !
yeah , nine years straight .
if we are going to identify the source of the mutation , we need to isolate your recombinant dna so we can activate positional genomes .
yeah . you do not wanna know the details .
ben , i am afraid i have got to ask
not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your
o kay . we will skip that question .
this is not permanent , johnny . we need to be careful until we are normal again .
oh , you remember my name do you ? you happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body ?
we are working as hard as we can
yeah . i can tell . victor was right .
ben , i do not know if this thing will change us back or make us worse . i need you to be patient for a little while longe
got it , teach .
forget it , egghead . i am good as is .
actually , the engines are smes . hydrogenbase , carbon propellant . couple generations past your last ride . i am not as dumb as you look .
keep talking , there will not be a next time .
course not . strictly business .
yeah , well , his eyes say different .
hey , two hearts got busted last time . maybe she is not over it either .
let s see you got victor , stud of the year , more coin than god ? or reed , the world s dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp . hmmm , it is a toss up .
put your tiny little mind at ease .
do not you wander off , boy .
back on earth . victor s medical facility . . . we are in quarantine .
reed ? . . . sue ?
they are fine . everybody else . . . is fine .
i swear to you they have done everything humanly possible . the best plastic surgeons in the world , ben . you had the best
give me a mirror . . .
give me the god damn mirror !
go back to the drawing board .
really ? with a name like von doom ? never saw that one coming .
hey , i am mr . sensitivity now . clear the way , wide load coming through .
and they are changing into . . .
i do not really know . a compound organic metallic alloy . stronger than titanium or carbon steel . harder than diamonds
like the shields reed said would protect us . how long ?
at this rate , the infection should be complete in two , maybe three weeks
what do you mean complete ?
i wish i could tell you . i cannot pretend to know what we are dealing with here . i will notify the cdc and
the center for disease control . if this thing is contagious
that is terrible news . . .
i do not know if we have noticed , but the sickest runs this side of the alps are right outside that window
so are you !
i mean , you feel a little feverish .
i have never felt better in my life . when do you get off work ?
my shift ends at four , but i could not
meet me at , top of the run . that will give you a minute to freshen up .
stay right . left is trouble .
i though we went over this .
last one down springs for room service .
not this again
no you are on fire !
what about you ?
ben ! ben !
the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna .
cool . what would it do to you guys ?
ben , are you there ?
you have been working out .
what he is trying to say is every team needs a mascot . . .
oh , it is .
this place is deluxe . you got cable ?
. . . and figure out how to reverse them . let me show you to your rooms .
i can go hotter !
gotcha . okay . supernova bad .
what are you trying to say ? just because i dress well and like to dance
what ? no . i am trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms .
oh , well that is easy i am hot . you are . . . well , you are a little limp . sue s easy to see through . and bengs always been a hardass . why are not you writing this down ?
they are not costumes .
right , whatever , have fun .
act . here we go again . reed , what if we got these gifts for a reason ? what if we have some , you know . . . like , calling ?
a higher calling like getting girls and making money ?
but all these people . . .
now .
keep the hot side hot , and the cool side cool !
please tell me you go silent too .
johnny .
okay , mom .
i think that thing is ben .
grow up , johnny . you want to run around on fire for the rest of your life ?
is that a trick question ? c mon , i cannot be the only one who thinks this is cool .
you were at kelvin . any hotter , you are approaching supernova
sweet .
that is the temperature of the sun .
girl . . . ? !
dude . that is my sister .
you gave us names ? what are you , the face of the fantastic four now ?
blockhead started it !
yeah , for the last time , i hope . i am done with this freak show . i am moving back to the real world .
is that what you call it ? real ?
at least it beats living in a lab like somebody s science project .
look around , sis ! she is not here . so you can stop talking to me like i am your little boy
as soon as you stop acting like one . come on , you are smarter than this . you think those people out there care about you ? you are just a fad to them .
no , i am sorry , for pushing you out .
sis . let me take care of you for once .
but johnny . . . you cannot fly .
and if he is not . . . ?
reed s always right . good thing he does not always know what he is got . . .
showtime .
it is not just the money . i could make money in my sleep .
then what is it ?
history , leonard . history . everything else is conversation . . . how is the other matter ?
recording , sir . we see you perfectly .
stable . we are looking at low twenties . it is a good number , considering the fallout from
reed s disaster . you know , i half think he did this to me on purpose .
sir , i am sure he would not put himself
actually , uh , people seem to think the scar humanizes you .
and that is a good thing ?
later . first , i have got some unfinished business . a deal that needs closing . . .
that is why . because i could have any other woman . . . you know , when they asked caesar why england , he said , because it is not mine .
yes sir . you have got the mayor at eight , then a nine thirty interview with the journal
front page ?
top left , like you asked . today wall street . tomorrow , who knows . . . maybe washington .
never better .
i was talking about us . working together .
right . that is exactly what i meant .
it is been changed .
well , he is welcome to ride shotgun , but we already have a pilot on our payroll . you remember my brother johnny . . .
great minds think alike .
yes , thanks .
that is good . that is uh . . . good .
you always had a way with words . i should be getting back .
i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship
which was ?
passion .
you are such a dork , reed . . . you never got it and never will unless it is explained to you in quantum physics .
what ? what do you mean you
sue . . . look at your hands .
let s not jump to conclusions , we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap .
we need to get past them .
what . . . ? oh .
that is what we are here to find out .
if it happened to him , then it could . . .
what about you ? you have not eaten in days . how come you are never on this side of the microscope ?
excuse me ?
anger . rage . frustration .
okay . is there any way to duplicate that feeling ? some memory or . . .
i am sure i can come up with something .
what in the world would give me that idea ?
are you kidding ?
no , i distinctly remember you walked out my door . ergo . . .
i think it was a little more complicated than
i just wanted to share an apartment . what was so complicated about that ?
no . there were not . there was you . and me . no variables , no math . it was actually the simplest thing in the world . but your head got in the way . . . like it always does .
the plants , from space . their particles are still charged . with the right amount of energy , those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm .
and reverse the mutations
curing countless diseases , not just ours .
of course . of course .
and you sure you can control this thing ? last time did not work out so well .
with the right energy , we can stabilize the storm . maybe tie into the city grid . . .
no way to know . without more tests , experiments .
he was going to take away all my data , equipment
better than your life . victor s not the one who has to get into that thing . we are .
every variable but yourself . you do not eat , sleep . you cannot live in your head like
i am not the only one in there . i got you , vic , ben , johnny , all rattling around in there .
reed . shh . just be quiet . and look up .
you were ?
of course i was . i would read all your papers on bioethics . some of them two times just so i would have something to say to you .
i gave him twenty .
i did . i did , reed . . . but i wanted you to be that man .
why did not you say something ?
that would have kinda defeated the purpose . and reed . . . i am saying it now .
reed , stop , you need to rest your
the power . . . i need . . . more power . . . to control . . . the storm
you need a doctor .
i am sure i can come up with something .
a gasket ? reed , we are at a party .
you remember in school we talked about working together . that is what i was about to explain . . .
not at all .
the number s seventy five . and it is applications and patents .
hilarious .
sure .
get a grip . reed . we did not come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch . just close the shields . . .
bengs still out there
so reel him in . but we came here to do a job . so let s do it . quickly .
reed , we are running out of time .
it is too late for him , and soon it will be too late for all of us .
ben did this .
ben did this ?
he is had some kind of . . . reaction to exposure from the cloud . and he is not the only one .
not much . we need to run tests to see the extent of the damage .
i ruined ? with all due respect , i told you to abort
abort ? reed , i put my company , my name , billions of dollars on the line , and i will not let you make me look like a fool
victor , if we could understand what happened to us
i do not want to understand it . this is not one of your science projects . i just want to fix it . fast !
what i should have done a long time ago . applications and patents , reed . this all belongs to me .
which is precisely the point . analysis is over . it is time for action . my men could have mass produced this by now .
i think you both know my director of genetic research , susan storm .
i understand the business reasons .
well , when you are looking at your future , it never hurts to find closure about the past .
right , of course , the company . . . but you see , i have come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with
uh , victor , i hope i have not done something to make you think . . .
sue , i have lived my life unafraid of taking big steps . and this is the biggest step yet . if it helps , think of this as a promotion . a merger of sorts . . . four little words that can change our lives . . .
raising the shields .
you cannot leave them out there .
victor , are you feeling alright ?
just find him .
i told you , i am fine . it is you i am worried about .
i am sorry i did not get a chance to
please , no apologies . i have arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos . you will have round the clock care .
it is . there s something we need to talk about . something i need to ask you . . .
susan . what are you doing ?
same old reed . all analysis , no action . was not that the problem with you two ?
then why is reed dragging his feet ? maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass . . . it is ironic , is not it ? you are finally the perfect woman for him . . . because you are his science project .
oh , i think you already have .
victor , we cannot do anything until the research is ready .
i know it cannot be easy . life has not changed that much for reed , sue and johnny . at least they can go out in public . but for you ? people staring . whispering behind your back . . .
if you are trying to cheer me up you are doing a helluva job
i am just saying , i know what it is like to lose something you love . to see it slip away , and know it is never coming back .
for your sake i hope you are right . i am sorry if that sounds a little skeptical .
skeptical . . . ?
arnold . that is happening ?
you want to work at carl s ?
oh , man , if you could swing something there , i would do anything for you . i want to work with you guys .
i can probably get you in there . just let me talk to dennis taylor .
all right ! !
of course .
how much did they cost ?
do not worry about it .
brad . i do not want to have to use sex as a tool .
tool ? tool for what ? we have been going together almost two years !
i do not want to talk about it here , brad .
if you would apologize i think dennis would take you back .
apologize to that wimp ? no way . fuck dennis taylor .
look , brad , i have been trying to think of a way to tell you this . we are almost out of high school , this is our last year . i think we owe it to ourselves to be free , and meet some new people . then , if we get back together , we will know it is the right thing .
come on , spicoli . why do not you just put your shirts back on ? see the sign ?
totally .
it is the first door on your left .
it is the first door on your left !
on the ledge ?
first door on your left !
there it is !
later .
this is how i dress all the time .
but you took off your captain kidd uniform .
i thought i would take it off for the drive over to ibm . it is kind of uncomfortable .
you really want me to put all this stuff back on ?
yes . i think so . show some pride , hamilton .
no . i want my money back right now .
well , that is not the way it works , really . and you ate most of your food already , too . . .
see that sign ? it says money back guarantee . do you know the meaning of the word guarantee ? do they teach you that here ? give me my money back .
look . just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my . back . okay ? please , brad ?
i am sorry , sir . just let me find the forms here .
i am so tired . i am so tired of dealing with morons . how hard is it to . . .
manager ! !
sis .
u . s . history . mr . hand .
hey yo .
why cannot you do it ?
your friends use the pool . your friends messed it up .
your friends use the pool too .
i take out the garbage .
do not strain yourself .
they are not home yet .
brad , what would you say if i asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the cruising vessel and get rid of them at work ?
i would say . . . who the hell is ron johnson ?
i will explain everything later .
do not worry about it . who sent the flowers ?
it is just some guy i met at swensongs . you do not know him .
i do not care it you tell me or not . i got problems of my own .
are you kidding ? work is great . i kill at work . i do not even mind mom and dad making me pay rent .
you are going to break up with lisa , are not you ?
i have been doing some thinking . it is my last school year . i am a single , successful guy . i think i want my freedom .
why ? because she will not sleep with you ?
where did you hear that ?
i am just guessing .
well . . . it is true .
maybe you just need to give her some time . she is so nice , brad . everybody loves lisa .
everybody loves lisa . everybody loves lisa . but everybody does not have to be her boyfriend .
why ?
i do not know . i was just curious .
maybe yes . maybe no .
you are a virgin !
i did not say that .
but your face did !
maybe yes . maybe no .
do not give me that shit ! i know you are still a virgin !
it is just linda . and mark from school .
see you later .
thanks a lot , brad . i really appreciate it .
brad . please do not tell mom and dad . . .
no .
all right , then . it is your secret .
no , just a couple of surfers with no shirts on . i took care of it , dennis .
they were left over from the last shift .
those were perfectly good fries , hamilton . perfectly good .
but they were not mine .
okay , dennis .
he insulted me first . he called me a moron .
did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way ?
yes , sir .
you are fired .
ugh .
dad says you are late again , you butthole !
leave me alone .
dad says !
go away , curtis . if you cannot knock , i cannot hear you .
nice to meet you .
oh , really ?
o kay , you guys can come swimming . but you have to leave as soon as my mom gets home . okay ?
get a ride with somebody .
sometimes i get a ride with my brother . but he usually works in the mornings , and then drives to school himself .
what a guy .
mark is a really nice boy . . .
sure . come on in .
i do not know .
are not you curious to see how your class picture turned out ?
i know what i look like .
well . . .
brad probably has some trunks you can borrow . . . i am going to my room to change !
i do not know . it is getting pretty late . . .
come on . . .
he is my friend , too .
so are you . are you shaking ?
no . are you crazy ?
you first .
how about both of us at the same time ?
let s continue .
what ? are you all right ?
i think we are making a lot of noise .
i am sorry . i am really sorry .
i think i came . did not you feel it ?
i guess i did .
i did not see you this morning .
look , i am kind of in a hurry .
i am in a hurry too . i just thought i could say hi to you .
hello .
mike , there s something that is been on my mind and i have to tell you about it .
what ? now ?
mike . i want you to know that i am pregnant .
i know it is yours .
all right , i take it back .
we have got to get an abortion ?
yeah . my brother art got his girlfriend one once .
it is already planned , mike . it is going to cost at the free clinic .
does not sound free to me . so you want me to pay for it ?
half . okay ? seventy five dollars . and a ride to the clinic .
seventy five dollars , and a ride . okay .
all right . all right . i just cleaned b . give me a break .
get going .
you should work for yourself .
what do you mean wuss ? this girl is my exact type . it is her . definitely her .
it is definitely your mama .
damone , you gotta listen to me .
she is in my biology class .
did you get her number ?
no .
did you get her name ?
no . it is too soon .
it is never too soon ! girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes .
well , what do you want me to do ? go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say , hello ! i would like you to take your clothes off and jump on me ?
i would . yeah .
really ?
i can see it all now . this is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at fotomat this summer . you bought forty bucks of fucking film and you never even talked to her .
you tell me , mike . what do i do ?
okay . okay . here s what you do .
of course something happens . you put the vibe out to thirty million chicks , you know something s gonna happen .
that is the idea , rat . that is the attitude .
the attitude ? the attitude dictates that you do not care if she comes , stays , lays or prays . whatever happens , your toes are still tapping . when you are the cruelest and the coolest . . . then you have the attitude .
i hear they all dress like that at lincoln now .
there used to be three or four of those guys . now we see em every time we come to the mall .
yeah ?
ace the jacket .
what do you mean ? men have died trying to obtain this information . i will give it to you for free .
all right . pay attention .
i think i have got it . once i get going , i will be okay . but . . . how do i get started ? i mean , i hardly know her .
you wuss . it is no problem . one person says something to the other and that is how it starts . . .
damone . it is mark .
mark . what happened to your date ?
it is happening right now . i am here at the atlantis . everything s fine except . . . i left my wallet at home .
did you go home and get it ?
no . it is too late . the food is coming and everything . damone , i have got to ask you this favor , and i will never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other . will you please borrow your mom s car , go by my house , get my wallet , and meet me back here ?
i am really pretty busy . . .
damone ! you come here ?
i come for the seafood . it is great ! hey . . . you know what , mark ? i found your wallet the other day . you want it back ?
wow . i have been looking for that thing ! hey , damone , have you met stacy hamilton ? stacy , this is mike damone .
okay . see ya .
really .
chicken !
no damone . i do not understand .
she was not really your girlfriend anyway .
hey fuck you damone . there s a lot of girls out there and you mess around with stacy . what have you got to prove ?
jesus . i am sorry .
i always stick up for you . whenever people say aw , that damone is a loudmouth and they say that a lot i say you just do not know damone . when someone says you are an idiot , i tell them wouldamone s not an idiot . you just do not know him . well , you know , damone , maybe they do know you pretty good . and i am just finding out .
fine . get lost .
you are crazy . those girls love me .
whatever you say , rat .
sensitive what is that ?
sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking .
so what makes you so sensitive ?
well , for one , i read . i do not watch as much television as you . i am trying to feel things more . i am learning a lot about people .
what do you read ? that is the last book you read ?
lust for life . it is the story of vincent van gough .
yeah , well , i saw the movie . that must mean i am sensitive too .
it is a way , damone . it is a vibe . i put it out , and i have personally found that girls do respond .
yes .
i am carrie frazier from toys r us . judy hinton from may company told me i could ask you something .
and they do not call my parents ?
not if you are over sixteen .
okay . thanks a lot , linda .
and do not let them talk you into a diaphragm either .
outrageous , merv . nice to be here . i feel great .
i was going to say . . . your eyes look a little red .
i have been swimming , merv .
i wanted to talk a little bit about school , if i could . . .
school . school is no problem . all you have to do is go to get the grades . and if you know something , all you have to do is go about half the time .
how often do you go ?
i do not go at all .
well , it pretty much speaks for itself . peter , you want to run with it ?
fascinating .
that is me , merv .
totally .
merv , i am thinking . . . i have only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards .
i thought he was out of town .
he is .
then do not hassle it .
naw . any good ?
suzanne somers tits .
all right .
i like sex .
this ai not no cop .
they are fucking with us .
all right . die , granada jocks !
you know the thing i love about mustangs ? the steering wheel .
just be glad you are all right .
my brother is gonna shit .
make up your mind . is he gonna shit , or is he gonna kill us ?
first he is gonna shit . and then he is gonna kill us .
will you just relax , mon ? he is not gonna kill us . my father is a television repairman . he is got all kinds of tools . i can fix this car .
you cannot fix this car , spicoli .
hey , mon , i do not know what your trip is , but . . .
do you think that guy s cute ?
yeah , but i fucked up . you can take it . really .
come on , stacy , it is your section and your man .
what should i do ?
just take his order , look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny , laugh a lot .
should we buy a frame for that ?
come on , linda , i have not had a boyfriend all summer . you promised when i started working at the mall that my life would change . . . do you think he will call this week ?
listen , stace , you want to know about guys ? i will tell you . they are mostly chicken . before i met doug i chased after every guy i thought was cute . i thought if i gave out a vibe they would get the message and call me up . well , guess what ? they do not call .
so what did you do ?
i called them . if i was sitting next to a guy and i wanted to sit closer , i would sit closer . if i wanted to kiss him , i would just do it . you want ron johnson ? grab him .
i cannot do that .
really ?
stacy , what are you waiting for ? you are fifteen . i did it when i was thirteen . it is no huge thing . it is just sex . if you do not , one of the other girls will .
he was hot , was not he ?
if i did not have a fianc in chicago , i would go for it .
believe it .
no way ! he just called him a dick .
god . people exaggerate so much at this school .
i know .
oh , give me a break , stacy . you are much prettier than them .
what do you mean better in bed . you either do it or you do not .
no there are variables that , like , i might not be good at .
what variables ?
like , you know , giving blow jobs .
that is the big deal ?
well i never did it .
there s nothing to it .
oh ! that is where that group got its name from .
it was okay .
you will always remember your first time .
it was nice .
so tell me , do you like ron ? is it serious ?
come on , linda . it is just sex .
hey ! that is my line !
do not you dare , you will never hear from him again .
does doug care that you are seventeen ?
doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like . that is why i am marrying him .
if he ever calls again i will say i am eighteen .
boy i am so glad to be through with all these games .
i think christmas brings out the worst in people .
i guess ron has not called yet .
not since november .
stacy . what does it matter ? he is a stereo salesman . you want to marry him ? you want to have kids with him ? you want this guy to come home , fifty years old , and he is still got that little pacific stereo badge on ? come on .
stacy . how many times do i have to tell you ? you are really going to be beautiful . . . someday .
thanks a lot .
oh , come on . what is he ? fifteen ?
sixteen .
you really ought to look at this , linda . there s a drawing on every page . . . and all these quizzes . it is like school .
why do not you put your mother s secret book back ?
okay , penis , that is one , balls . . .
would not penis and balls be the same category ?
you are right . probably penis , mouth and neck .
all right ! here s another one . the most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first , you climax first , you and your mate climax together ?
climax together .
does that ever happen ?
no . but it is a nice idea .
listen to this . . . it says most women derive pleasure from sex , but they do not have real orgasms .
i do not know . thirty to forty minutes .
that is doug do in chicago ?
he works for the airline . he will be out here . you will meet him .
i think they are both virgins .
no .
i know . he hates to have to wear uniforms .
god , i do not think so . better look in the house .
i do not know , i am just so depressed . everything is just so . . . depressing .
i do not know . . . i just do not feel right .
what do you think it is ?
it could not be .
it could be . i had a pregnancy test at the clinic . i will find out monday . i guess it was damone .
of course it was damone . if it was ron johnson , you would be out to here !
i am not going to tell him . he is an asshole . i hate him .
but it costs money to have an abortion . even at the free clinic . you tell damone to pay for it . it is the least he can do . it is the guy s responsibility too .
what ?
you did not tell me that they can be so nice , so great . . . but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they are five years old .
you are right . i did not tell you that .
that little prick .
then i called his house , and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father .
that little prick .
i paid for it and everything .
there goes your stereo for another year . mike damone is a no brain little prick . i am not letting him get away with this .
do not do anything , linda . i would rather just forget about it . i do not even like the guy .
stacy , he is not a guy . he is a little prick !
come on . there s lots of men around here . keep your eyes open .
you know , linda . i have finally figured it out . it is not sex i want . anyone can have sex .
what do you want ?
i want romance .
romance in ridgemont ? we do not even get cable tv .
he is not coming .
not coming ? what happened ?
he says he is got to stay in chicago . he says i should visit him sometimes .
sometime ?
yeah , like maybe never .
but what are you going to do ?
well i might go to dartmouth .
dartmouth ? !
i did not tell anyone i applied cause i never thought i would make it .
i cannot believe it ! but what about doug ?
there s a world of guys out there . i just wish i did not have to date any of them .
hey doug stallworth ? it is his loss .
what class ?
this is u . s . history , right ? i saw the globe in the window .
really ?
oh , please . i get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and i do not see all my kids here .
that is the name they gave me .
yes .
hey , bud . that is your problem ?
thank you , desmond . that is the reason for your truancy ?
i could not make it in time .
you mean , you could not ? or you would not ?
i do not know , mon . the food lines took forever .
food will be eaten on your time ! why are you continuously late for this class , mr . spicoli ? why do you shamelessly waste my time like this ?
i do not know .
learning about cuba . having some food .
mr . spicoli , you are on dangerous ground here . you are causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time .
i have been thinking about this , mr . hand . if i am here . . . and you are here . . . does not that make it our time ?
and you , my friend . i will see you for a two hour detention every afternoon this week .
that is right , jeff . mind if i come in ?
yeah . the graduation dance mr . hand . it is the last school event of the year .
i am afraid we have got some things to discuss here , jeff .
did i do something wrong , mr . hand ?
i do not know . i guess so .
fine . you sit right here on your bed . i will use the chair here . as i explained to your parents just a moment ago , and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year i do not like to spend my time waiting for late students , or detention cases . i would rather be preparing the lesson .
hey , it is in my locker , mr . hand .
well , then , i am glad i remembered to bring an extra copy just for you .
hey , mr . hand , can i ask you a question ?
that is that ?
do you have a guy like me every year ? a guy to . . . i do not know , make a show of . teach other kids lessons and stuff ?
well , you will find out next year .
no way , mon . when i graduate u . s . history i ai not even coming over to your side of the building .
if you graduate .
you are gonna flunk me ? !
all right ! oh , yeah !
aloha , spicoli .
i know , everyone says that .
how about your phone number ?
no problem .
thanks . so do you .
where do you feel like going ?
i do not know . wherever you want .
how about the point ?
the point sounds fine .
all right , the point it is .
thanks . thanks a lot .
it is . it is very warm . i wonder how long it will last ?
yes . . . i am really nineteen .
what about those other guys you live with ?
no . i mean back to your home .
yes .
we keep them .
you keep them .
we keep them , in case the people come back .
my other question is . . . can i have your phone number so i can ask you out sometime ?
oh . . . yes .
sure thing .
yeah . it is my sister s .
yeah . she is pretty good .
yeah . she is pretty good .
i have heard that , too .
i think i will have the seafood salad special .
excellent .
oh yeah .
not at all .
two more cokes .
me , too . i am real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck .
do you want to come inside ?
are not your parents asleep ?
no , they are away for the weekend . brad and i are watching the house .
okay . sure . i will come in .
i do not know . probably out . want something to drink ?
no . that is okay .
well , i am going to change real quick . i hope you do not mind .
naw . i do not mind .
thanks . so . . . what do you want to do ?
do you want to see some pictures ? i kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high . how stupid , right ?
sure .
oh , yeah . i had mr . deegan .
do you really have to go ?
well . . . it is getting kind of late .
today s april th . damone never comes to school on april th .
that is april th ?
it is john bonham s birthday .
john bonham ?
john bonham . the drummer for led zeppelin . he died a couple years ago . every birthday he stays home and plays everything john bonham ever recorded . it is like his own holiday .
oh . i see .
nobody noticed . do not worry about it . we will just stay out here until everyone comes out , we will blend back in .
what about the notes ?
i will get you the notes .
hi , stacy . how are you ?
i am fine . mark , i am so glad you came over here because i want you to know something . i just thought i would tell you that i really enjoyed getting to know you this year .
i know everybody says it , but i really mean it .
yeah . i want you to have this picture , so you will not forget what i look like . and so you will remember to call me over the summer .
i would like that .
well . . . sure . she will have the seafood salad special . and i will have . . . the same .
anything to drink ?
two cokes .
okay . thanks .
i will have one more coke . . . do you want another coke , stacy ?
yes . . . it makes sense .
he is . do not worry , i will get it to him .
you did the right thing . never try to understand a press message . about half the time we use codes especially with dr . gonzo .
tell me . when will the doctor be awake ?
awake ? what do you mean ?
of course . but if i were you , i would leave the doctor alone until after he is eaten breakfast . he is a very crude man .
look . that telegram was all scrambled . it was actually from thompson , not to him . western union must have gotten the names reversed . i have to get going . i have to get out to the track .
there s no hurry ! the race is over !
not for me .
righto !
listen , you fuzzy little shithead i have been fucked around , in my time , by a fairly good cross section of mean tempered rule crazy cops and now it is my turn . fuck you , officer , i am in charge here , and i am telling you we do not have room for you .
my bags are out there in that white cadillac convertible . can you have someone drive it around to the room ?
do not worry about a thing , sir . just enjoy your stay .
well , thank you .
ah , yes . mr . duke ? you have one message call lucy at the americana hotel , room .
holy shit !
what ? what was that crazy bitch said to him ? there s a war on , man ! people are being killed !
killed ?
in vietnam ! on the goddamn television !
oh . . . yes . . . yes . . . this terrible war . when will it end ?
tell me . what do you want ?
crying ? why was she crying ?
well , uh . she did not say mr . duke . but since i know you are here with the police convention . . .
look , you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again . we are watching her very carefully . . . this woman has been into laudanum . it is a controlled experiment , but i suspect we will need your cooperation before this thing is over .
well , certainly . . . we are always happy to cooperate with the police . . .
do not worry . you are protected . just treat this poor woman like you would treat any other human being in trouble .
what ? ah . . . yes , yes , i see what you mean . . . yes . . . so , you will be responsible then ?
of course . and now i have to get back to the news . send up some ice .
you are another one of these california boys . your friend here s been telling us about dope fiends .
they are everywhere . nobody s safe . and sure as hell not in the south . they like warm weather . . . you would never believe it . in l . a . it is out of control . first it was drugs , now it is witchcraft .
witchcraft ? shit , you cannot mean it !
not where we operate .
naked .
what ?
dobermans do not talk .
what ?
you will . one of these nights you will wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart .
naw !
they will climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big bowie knives . they might even sit on your wife s chest . put the blade right down on her throat .
not down in my parts .
do ? jesus christ , man . they chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot ! then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood !
and nobody did anything ?
a major !
we know where he lives , but we cannot get near the house .
naw ! not a major .
he wanted the pineal gland .
really ?
that is how he got so big . when he quit the marines he was just a little guy .
you are going to need to take the bull by the horns go to the mat with this scum .
what do you mean by that ?
you know what i mean . we have done it before and we can damn well do it again !
las vegas .
a great town , that vegas . i bet you had good luck there . you are the type .
i know . i am a triple scorpio .
that is a fine combination . you cannot lose .
this is my granddaughter . . .
do not worry . . . . . . and i am actually the district attorney from ignoto county . just another good american like yourself .
hell , no !
i did not think so . because in spite of his race , this man is extremely valuable to me . hell , i forgot all about this beer . you want one ? how about some ether ?
what ?
never mind . let s get right to the heart of this thing . twenty four hours ago we were sitting in the pogo lounge of the beverly wills hotel . . .
wait a minute ! come back and have a beer !
one toke . you poor fool . wait till you see those goddamn bats .
no more of that talk or i will put the leeches on you .
jesus ! did i say that ?
or just think it ? was i talking ? did they hear me ?
it is okay . he is admiring the shape of your skull .
why not ? if a thing s worth doing , it is worth doing right .
indeed . we must do it . what kind of story is this ?
do not take any guff from these swine . now we need a sound store with the finest equipment . nothing dinky . one of those new belgian heliowatts with a voice activated shotgun mike , for picking up conversations in oncoming cars .
we will not make the nut unless we have unlimited credit .
we will . you samoans are all the same . you have no faith in the essential decency of the white mangs culture .
damn right !
my attorney understands this concept , despite his racial handicap . but do you ? !
my heart !
the medicine ? yes , it is right here .
you scurvy shyster bastard ! watch your language ! you are talking to a doctor of journalism !
what the fuck are we doing out here ? somebody call the police ! we need help !
pay no attention to this swine . he cannot handle the medicine .
the truth is we are going to vegas to croak a scag baron named savage henry . i have known him for years but he ripped us off and you know what that means , right ?
and eat them ! that bastard will not get away with this ! that is going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a doctor of journalism ?
god did not do that ! you did it ! you are a fucking narcotics agent , that was our cocaine , you pig !
you better be careful . plenty of vultures out here . they will pick your bones clean before morning .
you whore !
maybe thirty more minutes . as your attorney , i advise you to drive at top speed . it will be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal . are you ready for that ? checking into a vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid .
thirty minutes . it was going to be very close .
lacerda ?
if you think we are in trouble now wait until you see that is happening in the elevators .
but what about our room ? and the golf shoes ?
no , no . do not leave me !
not yet . i want to study its habits .
you bastard ! they will never let us back in that place . i leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around yelling about reptiles ! you scared the shit out of those people ! they were ready to call the cops . hell , the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there . . .
i think he is lying to us . i could see it in his eyes .
they will probably have a big net for us when we show up .
how about nickel nick s slot arcade ? hot slots , that sounds heavy . twenty nine cent hotdogs . . .
look , what are we doing here ? are we here to entertain ourselves , or to do the job ?
to do the job , of course . here we go . . . a crab louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars !
why what ?
what do you expect ? i am your attorney . you owe me five bucks . i want it now .
did the mescaline just kick in ? or was that debbie reynolds in a silver afro wig ? !
we wandered into a fucking time capsule !
where is the ether ? this mescaline is not working .
dogs fucked the pope , no fault of mine . watch out ! . . . why money ? my name is brinks i was born . . . born ?
get sheep over side . . . women and children to armored car . . . orders from captain zeep .
nonsense . we came here to find the american dream , and now we are right in the vortex you want to quit . you must realize that we have found the main nerve .
that is what gives me the fear .
look over there . two women fucking a polar bear .
please , do not tell me those things . . . not now . this is my last drink . how much money can you lend me ?
not much . why ?
i have to go .
go ?
yes . leave the country . tonight .
calm down . you will be straight in a few hours .
no . this is serious . one more hour in this town and i will kill somebody !
ok . i will lend you some money . let s go outside and see how much we have left .
can we make it ?
that depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door .
i want to leave fast .
ok . lets pay this bill and get up very slowly . it is going to be a long walk .
do they pay you to screw that bear ?
it will not stop . it is not ever going to stop .
probably the bartender . he wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress .
good god ! let s get out of here ! where is the elevator ?
do not go near that elevator . that is just what they want us to do . . . trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement .
you drive ! i think there s something wrong with me .
what for ?
no , we should leave the poor bastard alone . i get the feeling that he is avoiding us for some reason .
do not kid yourself . that portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous . he is watching us like a hawk .
he told me he was turning in early . . .
that little blonde groupie with the film crew ? you think he sodomized her ?
that is right , laugh about it ! you goddamn honkies are all the same !
room service sent it up . i wanted something to cut the limes .
what limes ?
they did not have any . they do not grow in the desert .
look you better put that blade away and get your head straight . i have to put the car in the lot .
music ! turn it up . put that tape on .
what tape ?
jefferson airplane . white rabbit . i want a rising sound .
you are doomed . i am leaving here in two hours and then they are going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps . right there in that tub .
i dig my own graves . green water and the white rabbit . put it on .
ok . but do me one last favor , will you . can you give me two hours ? that is all i ask just two hours to sleep before tomorrow . i suspect it is going to be a very difficult day .
how about a check ?
whatever s right .
do not touch it ! get back in that tub !
back the tape up . i need it again ! let it roll ! just as high as the fucker can go ! and when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off , i want you to throw that fucking radio into the tub with me !
bullshit ! do not make me use this .
jesus .
do it ! i want to get higher !
are you ready ?
why worry ? you will like it . nothing in the world like a mace high . forty five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves . . .
you cheap honky sonofabitch . . .
why not ? hell , just a minute ago , you were asking me to kill you ! and now you want to kill me ! what i should do , goddamnit , is call the police !
the cops ?
there s no choice . i would not dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife !
who said anything about slicing you up ? i just wanted to carve a little z on your forehead . nothing serious .
what are you doing in baker ? did not you get my telegram ?
what ? fuck telegrams . i am in trouble . you worthless bastard . i will cripple your ass for this ! all that shit in the car is yours ! you understand that ? when i finish testifying out here you will be disbarred !
you are supposed to be in vegas . we have a suite at the flamingo . i was just about to leave for the airport .
it cannot be helped . this is lucy . you know like lucy in the sky with diamonds .
plans ?
lucy .
shit . i met her on the plane and i had all that acid . you know , those little blue barrels . i gave her a cap before i realized . . . she is a religious freak . . . jesus , she is never even had a drink .
well . . . it will probably work out . we can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention .
she is perfect for this gig . these cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her . we can set her up in one of these back street motels , hang pictures of jesus all over the room , then turn these pigs loose on her . . . hell she is strong she will hold her own .
it is straight economics . this girl is a god send . shit , she can make us a grand a day .
no ! stop talking like that .
i figure she can do about four at a time . christ , if we keep her full of acid that is more like two grand a day . maybe three .
you filthy bastard . i should cave your fucking head in .
in a few hours , she will probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering jesus based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel samoan who fed her liquor and lsd , dragged her to a vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing , uncircumcised member .
you will go straight to the gas chamber . and even if you manage to beat that , they will send you back to nevada for rape and consentual sodomy . she is got to go .
we have to cut her loose . she is got two hundred dollars . and we can always call the cops up there in montana , where she lives , and turn her in .
what ? . . . what kind of goddamn monster are you ?
it just occurred to me , that she has no witnesses . anything that she says about us is completely worthless .
us ?
i felt like a nazi , but it had to be done .
that is good . you cannot be subtle in this town .
as your attorney , i advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline .
maybe we should take it easy tonight .
right . let s find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon . i feel a powerful lust for red salmon . . .
they are actually nice people when you get to know them .
man , i know these people in my goddamn blood !
do not mention that word around here . you will get them excited .
this is a fucking nightmare .
right . sure as hell some dope dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you are partying with a thousand cops .
man , you do not know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice !
just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a mcdonald s hamburger stand . she was a waitress , about sixteen years old . . . with a lot of people watching , too !
they just ran back out into death valley you know , where manson turned up . . .
like big lizards .
. . . and every one of them stacked naked . . .
they were all veterans .
hurry up with those drinks . we are thirsty . only two rums . make mine a bloody mary .
we keep it quiet . it is not the kind of thing you would want to talk about upstairs . not with the press around .
they will fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs .
lucy is looking for you .
no , she is looking for you .
me ?
she really flipped over you . the only way i could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself . i guess she figures you won . that phone message was not for me , was it ?
it is gone too far .
relax . let me handle this . you would make a piss poor lawyer . . . room , please . as your attorney , i advise you not to worry . take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit .
you will not need much . just a little tiny taste , that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger beer . adrenochrome .
hi , lucy ? yeah , it is me . i got your message . . . what ? hell , no , i taught the bastard a lesson he will never forget . . . what ? no , not dead , but he will not be bothering anybody for a while . yeah . i left him out there , i stomped him , then pulled all his teeth out . . .
i remember thinking , jesus , what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid .
where would you get this ?
never mind , it is absolutely pure .
jesus . . . what kind of monster client have you picked up this time ? there s only one source for this stuff the adrenaline gland from a living human body !
i could already feel the stuff working on me the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine maybe i should take a swim , i thought . . .
some of what ?
extract of pineal !
sure . that is a good idea . one whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia .
man , your head would swell up like a watermelon , you would probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours . . .
right !
. . . grow claws . . . bleeding warts .
yes !
. . . then you would notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back . . .
finish the fucking story ! what happened ? ! what about the glands ?
i think we should put her on the payroll . see what she comes up with .
do you think you can handle it ?
inspector rock will pay you . in cash . a thousand dollars on the ninth of every month .
yeh . . . this foreign made crap is sucking our dollar balance dry !
two glasses of ice water with ice .
how much is the lemon meringue pie ?
her eyes were turgid with fear , but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level .
we had abused every rule that vegas lived by burning the locals , abusing the tourists , terrifying the help . the only chance now , i felt , was the possibility that we would gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it .
never missed a plane yet .
ridiculous ! just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and i picked you up . you never saw me before . shit , this town is full of white cadillac convertibles . i plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate . you ready ?
why not ? but for christ s sake , just do it fast !
yeah . . . explaining my position . some asshole wrote a poem about that once . . .
you are under arrest !
nobody . i am the maid !
i know you are cops , but i thought you were just here for that convention . i swear ! all i wanted to do was clean up the room . i do not know anything about dope !
no ! i swear i am not !
you are damn right . but the first time you say anything about this , to anybody you will go straight to prison for the rest of your life . that is your name ?
alice . just ring linen service and ask for alice .
i fear nothing .
of course , officer .
why not ? it was getting warm anyway .
yeah . i know . i am guilty . i understand that . i knew it was a crime but i did it anyway . shit , why argue ? i am a fucking criminal .
that is a strange attitude .
a nap will not help . i have been awake for too long three or four nights . i cannot even remember . if i go to sleep now , i am dead for twenty hours .
how far is baker ? i was hoping to stop there for lunch .
not my jurisdiction . the city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area . can you make it that far ?

well , justice is funny .
hey !
easy .
there s a tunnel .
it is in the basement , about a hundred yards long . it spits out on the backside of that hill down the way . there s a truck there .
that is it for ?
what ! ? i am not going down there again !
this is it ! this is our only way out ! they have this place surrounded . we go out the front , we are dead . we go out the back , we are dead , but if we go under them . . . we might just make it . now , who else is in ? seven can go .
this is a bottleneck waiting to happen .
follow me .
in the corner , behind the curtain .
shit !
just move !
buddy , i am a full blooded chucktow . i cannot think of a time my people have not been taking it dry . the fact that we are being eaten now , does not even faze me . . . . . . this is just another tuesday .
fuck you too .

of course not . i fight monsters all the time .
the door . . . on three .

why do not you go check it out ?
fuck no .
you were not helping .

believe me , i would love to save the day and get some heroic snatch . but it is not in the cards , partner .

your brother , huh ?
yep .
your parents of relation ?
we lived near power lines .

uh , uh , i think if we can get everyone into it . . . we can get out of here .
that is in the back ?
nothing , this was my last delivery .
but not flush against the tunnel ?
just cover me . it was built to move .
well . . .
oh .
gimme a couple dabs on the tongue .
magic potion . you should try a little .
oh , no .
it will calm your nerves . works like a charm .
really ?
uh huh . just put a dab on your tongue .
will i go crazy or something ?
no , no , it calms you , makes everything nice and smooth . just takes the edge off like a beer , but in a fraction of the time .
why not then ?
but
it is much safer in there , sweety .
okay then .
i cannot feel a thing , hon .
the girl s got rhythm .
sure .
how much you got ?
how much i got , what ?
you do not understand sweety , daddy does not pay , daddy sees the show for free . but you do get points for being horny on a night like this .
uh huh , now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on daddy s face , i wanna do some appraising .
well , where is the sonuvabitch ! ?
he is dead .
what ?
easy . we are surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before . some kind of animals . real fast , volatile , predators . one went through three of your patrons like they were kleenex .
so , your dead hubby shot me twice , three of my customers have been eaten , and there are angry creatures outside ?
he only shot you once .
huh ?
he shot you the other time .
the boards are solid oak planks , and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath . nothing real or supernatural is busting through this , least nothing the size of the beasts .
good .
no one goes anywhere alone . least of all , unarmed .
you are wasting your time , there s no one out there .
what ?
what do you mean what ?
huh ?
that is going on between you two ?
nothing .
grass . i grow some pot down there . it is no big deal , just something i dabble in . the truck s for a quick get away , deliveries , whatever .
is it gassed up ?
fully .
four door ?
two .
open ?
covered .
how many ?
holds four .
max ?
seven .
nine ?

let me make this clear if we stay , we die !
i do not trust you . no way ! i pick who goes ! and i am holding you responsible .
get outta here .
whoa !
oh ? and that is that ?
sit still , look less like a meal .
i think that is for bears and sharks , chunky chew .
they are probably on to the next buffet by now . there s a retirement home up the road . they would be easy .
what are you gonna do ? throw your teeth at em ? sit down , cocoon .

you sure ? i thought the rag had to touch ?
i am sure .
bonsai !
amazing you made it this far .
am i too heavy for you ?
do not worry , you will be like my little papoose .
helllppp !
as long as it is dark , they are around . they hide , wait for you to drop your guard , and then attack .
everyone take a role . let s prepare the guns , ammo and whatever else we can scare up . we also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here . so , who s going into the basement with me ?
is there any other way out of this place ? anyone ?
ok . let s see what happens .
i am done drinking . that is it . just church and grocery stores . nothing else .
right . were going to need some fire power . do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here ? anything at all ?
nothing , just looking .
she is not very nice , is she ?
you will hit us !
they will tear this place down within the hour .
and the last one is the . . .
father . the biggest , the strongest . . .
so we have got guns , kitchen knives , pipes , fire and sticks .
that is fine .
whoa !
wait god dammit !
make a distraction out front and go for it out the back . there s cars back there , right ?
not without you ! ! !
go ! ! !
go go go ! !
that is one piece of four problems .
stop her !
let s lock off this room .
all right .
i am fine , i really am .
i admire your strength .
we all have to be strong , right ?
right .
oh . . .
she is still alive , i hope . i would not have made it this far if it were not for the chance of seeing my little girl again . i need to get to her .
i will do anything to help .
i know . thanks . just do not tell anyone i have a soft side .
deal .
i would love to .
i think
um , my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present , sir .
um , well . . .
are you lying to me ?
well . . .
what did we say about lying ?
i am not lying .
you know that no one likes a liar , right ?
i said i am not lying .
i just hit it like you said .
this is a mistake . no . this is a disaster .
come on , it is just what you need ! let everyone see you . talk to them , live it up !
but we have been at it since six this morning . at least you could have let me go home and change .
look , frances , i did not want this job . think i am crazy ? but you begged me improve your image . so please . . . lemme try , huh ?
you are right . i am sorry . okay , let s go get em .
here , take a few of these . studio makes em in the basement . they keep the fat off .
so not only am i a troublesome bitch , but i am fat too ?
come on . they make you feel nice and peppy .
refill my drink , will you , bob ?
what are you doing ?
putting on my armor .
come on , frances . louella parsons is here . she wants to talk to you , help you out .
louella . . . did not she call me a spoiled little bitch ?
come on , she is an important columnist ! that is the matter ? i thought you wanted these people to forgive you .
forgive . . . ? for what ?
i am sorry . . . that was an unfortunate choice of words .
i am sure it was not me , it was not me . . .
excuse me , sir ?
i do not know who she fucked to get where she is , but i do not think it was me .
that is not the point . frances farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio , and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you . no . no , that young lady has a contract , and she is going to honor it .
oh . i mean , good .
i think it is time to take the gloves off . get me some reporters . particularly louella parsons !
who s this ?
frances farmer , contract player , six month option .
okay . good tits . cannot we show them off a little more ?
i guess so , sir .
very fine bone structure .
you see we have got to change that name .
thank you
i intend to make a great deal of money off you .
really ? that is a very good book . it would make a terrific
never mind that . i am concerned about you . your attitude .
but i am concerned with everything , mr . bebe .
no , i am concerned with everything .
but i am the one up there on the screen .
that is right . you are an actress , miss farmer and your job is to act .
i would like nothing better .
sure , claire . if you do not mind walking my way .
my clothes ?
yeah , i mean slacks . . . and work clothes . . . and that awful car
it is a perfectly good car . it runs .
yes , but . . . really , i hate to sound . . . it is just that the public expects something different from its stars . people will not take you seriously .
i do not care if my clothes are taken seriously . or my car .
you know what i mean .
uh huh . you mean what if the public finds out i perspire ? and wear slacks . and drive an old jalopy ? what if they find out i am a real person . oh no ! say it ai not so ! not a real person !
yup . claire . . . please , please tell mr . bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life , we would make a lot better movies .
i am sorry , frances . it is my job , you know ?
i know . this is a factory and we each have our jobs . the writer writes , the director directs , and the actress . . .
. . . acts . i will relay your message .
i am not !
you are afraid !
i am not !
you do not want to show your whole soul ugly , mis shapen , and pitiful you do not want to show it
god damn it , clifford , will you shut up ! i tell you , i want to give these things ! i want to give them to the audience , and i can give them , i will give them , so shut up !
what ?
thank you .
oh well . i guess i better leave then .
huh .
come here . i want to show you something .
really , mr . clurman , you do not have to sell me .
forgive my indulgence . seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy . the point is , mr . odets here has written a wonderful play . most of the roles are cast , but we have not found our female lead . . .
who is she ?
i am not afraid of struggle , clifford .
frances .
where is clifford ?
he is not here .
oh .
i hear you are meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract .
that is right . i do not want them breathing down my neck while we are in london .
well . . . well , you see , that is the point . you will not be opening in london .
what ? ! good lord no , it is just . . . it is money . we needed backing and . . . well , we found it .
who ?
an actress .
a rich actress .
yes . that is the deal . she plays lorna .
but . . . but wait a minute . we are supposed to be different , right ? clifford says . . . this theatre is supposed to be different ! and this play . . . this play is all about what greed and money do to people !
i know , but
what does clifford say ?
right now we have to be practical .
does clifford even know ? you did not tell him , did you ? i am gonna tell him . where is he ?
he knows , frances .
in my eyes , officer .
cool off , beautiful . did not you see the sign says dimout zone ? there s a war on , you know ?
come on . you are seriously trying to tell me the japs cannot find los angeles without my headlights ?
i did not make the law , lady . i just enforce it .
you have no right ! you have no fucking right , you bastards ! get the hell out of here
get your clothes on , lady
get out !
you are under arrest .
sort of .
there have been some calls .
who ?
well . . . about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called , that is her name ?
claire ?
yeah , claire . she said she was fired . too bad , huh ?
fired ?
yeah . she said she delivered your message and that you would understand .
. . . yes .
without me .
showdown .
you were not going to tell me , were you ? just pack up and leave , is that it ?
dick , we need some time apart
hey , i am not a complete fool , you know . i can see you are going sour on me , and when i try to do something about it , you turn your back and say it is nothing .
dick , i cannot even breathe here . . .
dwayne ! i am dwayne now ! and you damn well better get used to it !
dick . . .
i do not suppose it occurred to you that i might want to leave too , that i might want to do theatre ? no , cause you do not want me along , do you ? and the reason has nothing to do with summer stock .
no ?
no . it is all about that night , is not it ?
what night ?
the premiere . i never pressed you about it but god damn it , you are gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were !
you want his name ?
the hearing s tomorrow . if she gets out legally , they cannot come after her .
look at her ! she will never pass that sanity test tomorrow . . .
i am taking care of that , harry . just hold her . reserpine . i guarantee you this will clear her head . she will wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing .
frances , we gotta do it this way . just remember tomorrow , remember what i told you . what are you gonna tell em ?
i gotta go now .
all square , doc .
good . cause i do not want to see you again .
i know you believe that .
. . . do not you ?
i am afraid not . you see , we observe things that you are unaware of signs , indicators . your problem cuts very deep , frances , and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out , you will really feel secure . does that make sense ?
listen to yourself , frances . the resistance , the anger in your voice .
you . . . i am sorry , forgive me . doctor , tell me honestly , what do i have to do to get out of here ?
be patient , that is all . take an interest in your treatment and do not dwell on your resentments . you will be yourself again , i assure you .
. . . i see .
we will talk more about this . i will see you later .
one question . if i am not myself now , just who do you think i am ?
we will get you home , frances .
thank you , harry .
but i will never win that .
yes , yes , it is all arranged . everyone s collecting subscriptions in your name . and the best part is the trip returns you to new york .
really ?
new york , frances ! broadway ! this is your chance ! you belong on the stage !
thank you .
. . . no , ralph . i do not believe i ever was sick . but when you are treated like a patient long enough , you are apt to act like one . . .
no .
were you a drug addict ?
no . never .
thank you , frances . and after the show we are hosting a reception for you and your friends at hollywood s own roosevelt hotel !
see you next weekend , dad .
thanks , dad .
an essay contest . . . a national contest . that is pretty impressive .
i did not have much to do with it .
you wrote it , did not you ?
yeah , i suppose . . . dad , who s harry york ?
well , harry york is a guy who . . . well , he does a lot of things . why do you ask ?
he talked to me today . told me to keep my mouth shut or i would get everybody in trouble .
yeah . . . well . . . it is possible . harry york and i both work for mr . kaminski right now , and . . . well . . . there are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break . that is the way of things , but mr . kaminski wants to change it , and when it comes to new ideas , the people in power get nervous .
is kaminski a communist ?
no , no , no . all he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation .
he is a socialist , then ?
i know .
and i cannot understand how it can hurt to be honest , but the more i tried to explain
francie , you will learn that sometimes it is best to stay low and just walk away .
you really want to go ?
of course .
and you think it is worth all this ?
if i did not , i would not put you through it .
. . . then go .
be careful , francie .
i do not know , honey . your mother has such big plans for you .
i know that , dad , but
what you have to understand , francie , is that she . . . well . . . she wanted so much for herself too , and for me , and she never really got to . . . the only time i ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers . . . but she could have been . . . if times were different she could have been a politician or . . . i do not know .
but dad , i am asking about me . what do you think i should do ?
well , francie , sometimes after you get your hands on something you want , it just does not look the same . then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it is all you have got . . . or just let it go . this is the way of things , but i guess you already know that .
dad . . . whatever i decide , will it be okay with you ?
always . always .
i do not care , dad . i love you .
i love you too , francie .
why ? it is such a simple thing . you just let me out and i disappear down a road and you never have to see me again .
they will just catch you again , francie . besides , your mother will know .
but i gave her my word . besides , she is still your legal guardian . my hands are tied .
please , francie . . .
daddy !
i pity us , dad . i pity us both .
i can thank you for that . it was a hard earned talent .
thank you .
whengs the last time you saw a hundred dollars , ernest farmer ?
i have a right to talk to her . she is my daughter , and she is beginning to understand why i have sacrificed so much in order to achieve . . .
you have sacrificed ? ! if you would practice law for decent folk instead of communists and indigents
they need help , lil . they pay me back in other ways .
how ? what do they do for you , kaminski and his friends ? they are all anarchists ! traitors !
no , lil . it is just you cannot understand their brand of patriotism .
that is right . i cannot understand a man who puts strangers over his family , a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure .
good .
see you next weekend ?
as usual . everything as usual , mr . farmer . just give me my due .
do not make me sick . i would sooner drown myself in puget sound .
that is a thought , lil . that sure is a thought .
oh , angela ! go with these trappers ! they will lead you safely down the mountain . . .
but , kurt , i . . .
no , no arguments . be my good girl and go . there s a forest , a burning forest , and you know what i have to do !
oh , kurt !
oh angela , my own . . . angela !
i do not believe this ! you jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you do not even know who the hell i am !
fifteen .
address ?
just put me down as a avg a vagrant vagabond . come on , this is a joke ! assault and battery ? i barely touched that bitch !
occupation ?
you can always come see it in london .
only if you were in it . are you ?
i would not miss it .
boy , i would love to . . . but i am going to hollywood .
are you an actor ?
hell yes ! . . . well , okay , i am still in school . but as soon as i graduate . . . california , here i come !
are you really serious ? about acting ?
why . . . yes .
then do not go to hollywood .
why ?
i am telling you straight , if you have any serious ambitions , stay clear of the place . it will crush you .
you sound as if you hate it .
no , i do not hate it .
. . . not if i can help it .
gosh ! you will break a lot of hearts .
they will mend .
what about your husband ?
will you be getting back together ? when you quit hollywood , i mean .
what is this ?
why , you . . . you little bastard !
you are wasting your time , lady . nothing s off the record with me .
do not touch me .
i am not gonna hurt you . i just wanna talk .
well . . . you are causing trouble , you know that ?
i am causing trouble ? ! you are a pain in the butt ! you newshounds have been after me and my folks ever since i won that dumb contest . i am just sixteen , you know ? who the hell cares what i think ?
not me . but other people seem to .
yeah . well if you did not put it in the papers nobody would even know about it .
now wait a minute , sweetie . do i look like a newshound to you ?
no . . . actually , you look more like a cop .
harry york . i work for martoni kaminski , he is running for congress here .
oh yeah ! i saw you in the newsreel !
yeah , well
you know , my dad s done some work for kaminski . . .
now you are catching on . do not wanna get your daddy in hot water , do you ?
whattaya mean ?
well . . . see the papers have got us pegged as pinkos , then you come along , the friendly neighborhood atheist
but i am not . the newspapers are
right again . you are no more an atheist than my mangs a red , but what they are doing , see , they are adding up their version of your ideas with their version of ours . could look bad for your daddy .
yeah . could look bad for you and kaminski too , i guess .
well are not you the smoothie . now you are going to ask for my number , i suppose .
i suppose not . gotta ask you this , though for all our sakes , you better keep your trap shut .
well . . . i will give it a try , mr . york .

you are coming .
and ?
well . . . to get a crack at something good , you gotta earn it , you gotta climb the ladder first . so you do , you work hard , and all these people behind you are pushing you up , shouting you on . and then one day you realize you are , you are at the top . . . and there s nothing there . and you look behind you and there s no one below . you are just left there all alone . . . swaying in the god damned breeze .
who said i was a lady ?
you have looked a whole lot better . c mon .
that sure looks like fun . . . you know how long it is been since i was behind the wheel ?
forget it , frances . you are not driving .
have i told you how mean you are turning , york ?
couple hours from idaho . we will cut across to montana . i have got friends there with a ranch .
i should have known . . .
what ?
this is another one of your schemes to get me off alone . . .
that is right .
. . . take advantage of me .
whattaya think you are in now ?
i do not know . not a war exactly . it is more a . . . a misapprehension maybe . . .
huh ?
a misunderstanding , people taking the wrong meaning from things . i was not declaring war , harry . i was just saying my prayers .
frances , you are fulla drugs . you do not know what you are saying . who do you think put you into meadow wood ? your mother thinks you are crazy and she will keep on thinking it as long as it suits her .
no , she just did not want me going to jail , that is all .
yeah ? she is a shark , frances . i am not taking you there , and that is that !
i guess .
aside from meanness , you are almost perfect . there s only one other thing wrong with you .
that is that ?
you cannot drink .
hey ! another shot for the lady and a double for me !
what a man !
hey , you are a good quarter horse , kid , but you cannot go a route of ground .
to quarter horses .
no . to thoroughbreds .
huh ?
you should stickaround sometimes . look out for me .
look , frances , i am only gonna ask this one time . i mean it . i swear after this , i will never ask again will you marry me ?
i know a thing or two about marriage . you . . . you understand me more than anyone , harry . . . maybe even more than mama . but . . . you are too important to me . i would fail you . i do not know how or why , but i would . and that is a chance i just cannot take . do you understand ?
well . . . i will act like i do until i do .
that is that ?
will you marry me ?
thanks , harry , really , but . . . i cannot explain it . she is my mother . she is just . . . i cannot give up on her that easy .
you give up on her ?
yeah . it is just . . . something i gotta do , i guess .
frances , you are crazy .
i know . do not tell anyone .
i got your number , mister man .
who ?
frances , it is me , harry ?
. . . touch me again and i will kill you , you pig .
i love you too , frances .
oh harry . . .
yeah . i do not know .
you do not need to screw around anymore . you do not need dwayne steele or odets or your mother . you need me .
i know , but . . . there were so many people in there , harry . every time i turned around someone was pressing against me . . . watching , looking over my shoulder , touching me , grabbing , sticking things into me . when i feel somebody near me now . . . anybody . . . my skin starts to crawl .
oh please , harry . . . do not even think it . you are the only person who ever . . . it is just . . . cannot you wait for me ?
i do not know .
yes you do . if you love me you can wait , right ? a month , six months , whatever it takes .
right . except . . . time has a way of
no , harry , it is not time , it is us . you and me . and i am telling you now that i will come to you , okay ? i will find you . i will .
i hope so , frances .
oh . why , harry york . how nice to see you .
fine , thank you . did you watch the show ?
sure i did , that is why i am here .
how did i look ?
oh , you . . . . . . ennh .
well . . . you are looking well .
yeah . yeah , i heard about that .
dad , too . i sold the house . i am a faceless sinner , harry . . .
why do you say that ?
i would ask you to take me home , but i am a faceless sinner . . . . you smell good , harry . familiar , you know ? i would ask you to take me home , but . . .
i am not sure .
very slow . but we are not going to stop , are we ?
no .
no , we are not .
yes . would you like me to walk a little way with you ?
that would be okay .
just a little way .
it is always beautiful at this time . peaceful . . .
and no people .
yes .
wherever they are going , i am going .
yeah , i know what that is like . . . where you been ?
well , i was picking fruit with some migrant workers until . . .
what would you do ?
you know , i have never been able to figure that out .
run !
who s writing this guy s lines ?
answer the question ! have you driven a car since you were placed on probation ?
no , i could not get my hands on one .
have you reported to your probation officer as directed ?
i never saw him . why did not he show up ?
did you expect him to look you up ?
why , certainly . i wanted to get a peek at his face . . .
that is fine with me . . . get it ? fine . a fine ! hey c mon , c mon , what is this , an audience or a jury ?
miss farmer , is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night ?
sure it is true . i was fighting for my country as well as myself .
miss farmer , you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law abiding citizen
fine !
you are a deeply troubled young lady . . . i only hope you change your course before it is too late .
who are you ?
i live here .
you are farmer ? oh . . . well , look , they took your stuff out . moved it to some hotel , i think .
what ?
i am preparing it for the next tenant , he is coming in tomorrow .
golden boy .
i know , but i am not seeing it . it is there , frances , the fire is there , but it is not coming through . you are lazy
yes , you win them , you bring them into your heart , touch them , but you do not set them on fire !
but i want to . i am trying !
i need an incendiary ! an arsonist !
then show me ! that is what i am here for , to learn , to grow !
good . then it is very simple . you have to stop being afraid , frances . it is in you .
your big speech ?
how do i know it is true ? you will get to be the champ . they will all want you , all the girls ! but i do not care . i have been undersea a long time . when they would put their hands on me i used to say , this is not it ! this is not what i mean ! it is been a mysterious world for me ! but joe , i think you are it ! i do not know why , i think you are it . take me home with you .
i already have .
the speech ? real good .
you think i got it ?
you got it .
yeah . yeah , tonight i think i got it .
i am not hungry . you two just enjoy yourselves . after all , this is a celebration .
yes , ma .
and you . . . should be proud . you won that contest and made a name for yourself .
oh ma , they are not using me . it is just a chance to travel , see things . besides , it is the only way i can get to new york .
oh , mama , do not you understand ?
yes , but important people are concerned about this . judge hillier spoke to alma styles
i do not care .
. . . you will .
smile , little sister , smile .
mama , that is . . .
shhh , shhh . you are not going to jail , frances . the judge has put you under my care . i will see you get the rest you need .
you are taking me home !
are you crazy ? unhand that woman ! that is amelia earhart !
why are these all opened ?
well , they needed immediate answers , frances . it is good manners and good sense . you should not be bothering yourself with these right now .
then why did you bring them ?
it is your fan mail , little sister .
you kill me , mama .
what ?
go on . . .
frances , you remember my lawyer , alma styles ?
please . i want you to . it would make me so happy .
that is wrong ?
nothing . i think i will just go out for awhile .
where are you going ?
for a walk , mama . just a walk .
not long .
i will be back .
at one . promise ?
sure .
i promise i will . . . i promise , mama .
yes , mama .
i do not want you drinking , frances .
yes , mama .
oh frances , do i have news for you ! guess who
wait , mama , wait . i have something to tell you . i have decided . . . well . . . i am not going to make movies anymore . i thought that is what i wanted , and i went after it with all my soul , the way you taught me , but i was miserable , mama , and it nearly killed me . so now . . . now it is over . i want a different kind of life , something . . . simple . i want to live someplace quiet and peaceful . . . in the country maybe , and i will have dogs and cats i feel so light suddenly , so clear for the first time in . . . it is going to be okay , mama , i know it . and i love you .
mama . . . ?
they want you back ! your agent called today ! do not you understand ? he is sending the scripts . he wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people ! frances , you cannot do this to your fans ! why , they have been praying for you all through this nightmare . you cannot turn your back on them now ! look at this fan mail i have been answering !
i told him to come up ! i told him you wanted to show them all that there s nothing wrong with you any more , that you are completely cured !
i am not cured . i was never sick ! they had no business putting me in there ! my only responsibility is to myself now !
you . . . you selfish , selfish child . at least talk to him , hear what he has to say .
no !
you want to throw it all away , is that it ? you had everything , little sister . beauty . . . a brilliant career . . . a wonderful husband . you were a movie star !
mama , shut up !
and now you are throwing everything away ? you are gonna be a nobody ! nobody ! you know what that is like ? !
you . . . you would send me back , would not you ? you would .
i am going out !
you are not going anywhere !
yes , i am , and you cannot stop me ! you cannot tell me what to do , mother . i am a grown woman , and i can decide about my own life .
frances !
no . no , it all depends on what offers i get .
no , mama , i will take care of it . i will wash them in the morning .
thank you for understanding , mama .
i will , i promise .
i was hoping for a kind word , little sister .
you were hoping for a kind word ? ! you are my mother ! you are supposed to nourish me ! support me !
i have !
but what
no ! you are not talking now . you listen . you can send me away , lillian , you can pretend i am crazy and pretend i am still your little girl who cannot take care of herself , but one thing you cannot pretend anymore . you cannot pretend i love you because i do not . i cannot . not after what you have done to me . because you see . . . i am still me . . . i am trying real hard all this time to be me . . . and you , little sister , you have not been any help at all . okay , boys , i am ready .
excuse me .
yes . . . ?
do not i know you ?
i do not believe so .
sure . you shouted at me in the auditorium when i read my essay .
no , my dear . you must be mistaken .
oh bullshit .
am i supposed to say thank you ?
thanks are hardly necessary .
aw , shucks , ma am . t were not nothing .
i am glad to see you have not lost your sense of humor .
it ai not for lack of trying .
so it seems . may we be serious for a moment ?
why , doctor ! we have only just met !
among persons such as yourself , creative people under great stress , erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of . it is just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which . . .
please sit down . . .
you may discuss my predicament , doctor . you may discuss it with anyone you like , but not with me . i am not interested . i can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian .
i see .
besides , i do not want to be what you want to make me .
and that is that ?
normal . average .
all right . will you please sit down now ? symington says .
. . . did you really say that ?
just a little joke , miss farmer .
this whole thing is a joke !
stay calm , please .
no , you stay calm , doctor ! but you are finding that difficult , are not you ? why , are you attracted to me ? perhaps later , in some of our more intimate sessions . . . after we know each other a little better . . . and you have torn my personality to shreds , and i am weeping and vulnerable . . . then you will really get your kicks , will not you , doctor ?
i will have someone show you to your room .
oh , that is good , very professional . in control . but the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away .
you did not say symington says .
yes . it was very good to see her .
really ? any problems ?
you are telling me you feel guilty .
no . . . what i mean is . . . i am just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life , that is all .
do you really believe your mother s trying to kill you ?
what ?
she told me you said , mama , you want to kill me .
i never said . . . oh look . that is just a figure of speech . she said something funny , and i said . . .
and you accused her of tampering with your mail .
oh for christ s . . .
but you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative . whom do you think i should believe ?
doctor , i hate to break this to you , but my mother is a little batty .
frances , you are still filled with anxiety . you feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends . consequently , i did not recommend your release at the staff review .
you what ?
mental illness is an elusive thing , and though i am pleased you are feeling more . . . capable , it is perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time . do not you agree ?
dr . symington , how big is your dick ?
huh ?
cause if it is long enough , which i doubt , why do not you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass !
frances , i am warning you . . .
no , i am warning you ! who do you think you are , god ? you bumble around with your folders . . . . . . and your pencils . . . . . . and your god damn buttons . . . . . . all your badges of authority ! but you have no authority ! you are nothing ! you are a zero !
sedate her .
no !
is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future , and the future of your children ?
no !
is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country ?
no ! no !
good ! because , brothers , that is you !
yeah ?
i checked the files . this one holds the record for shock treatments . four hundred seventeen and no end in sight .
you are kidding .
yeah , well , you know doctors . they sure hate to use that word .
what ?
incurable .
yes .
i was watching .
what is that to you ? evil as you are .
i am as he made me . in his own image .
you drove him to his torment .
and he drove me to mine .
then why weep for him ?
would you not ? he was father . and mother . we fell from grace together . he from his god . i from mine .
what kindness ?
build for him a pyre . light up the sky with his passing .
the music ? or the fire ?
better that way . . . for me .
why ?
i am . . . very , very ugly . people are afraid . except you .
it cannot be as bad as that .
worse .
yes . i have been seeking my friends .
friends ? do they live around here ?
yes . very close
why do you not go to them ?
people can be kinder than you think .
i am afraid .
you speak .
yes , i speak . and read . and think . . . and know the ways of man . i have been waiting for you . two months now .
how did you find me ?
kill me and have done with it .
kill you ? hardly that .
then why am i here ? what did you want with me ?
more to the point , why am i here ? what did you want with me ? what does one say to one s maker , having finally met him face to face ? milton gave it voice . did i request thee , maker , from my clay to mould me man ? did i solicit thee from darkness to promote me ?
fine words from a child killer . you who murdered my brother .
your crime . . . as well as mine .
how dare you . you are disgusting and evil .
evil ? do you believe in evil ?
i see it before me .
i am not sure i believe . but then i had no one to instruct me . i had no mother . . . and my father abandoned me at birth .
there was something at work in my soul which i do not understand .
what of my soul ? do i have one ? or was that a part you left out ? who were these people of which i am comprised ? good people ? bad people ?
materials . nothing more .
you are wrong . do you know i knew how to play this ?
trace memories in the brain , perhaps .
stolen memories . stolen and hazy . they taunt me in my dreams . i have seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her . whose woman was this ? i have seen boys playing , splashing about in a stream . whose childhood friends were these ? who am i ?
i do not know .
then perhaps i believe in evil after all .
there is something i want . a friend .
friend ?
a companion . a female . like me , so she will not hate me .
like you ? oh , god , you do not know what you are asking .
i do know that for the sympathy of one living being , i would make peace with all . i have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine . and rage the likes of which you would not believe . if i cannot satisfy the one , i will demonically indulge the other . that choice is yours . you are the one who set this in motion , frankenstein .
and if i consent ?
we would travel north , my bride and i . to the furthest reaches of the pole , where no man has ever set foot . there we would live out our lives . together . no human eye would ever see us again . this i vow .
yes . i want this over and done with .
i will be waiting . and watching .
her body pleases me .
a brain . extremities .
this was not taken from a grave .
what does it matter ? she will live again . you will make her .
no . i draw the line .
i will not ! kill me now !
that is mild compared to what will come . if you deny me my wedding night . i will be with you on yours .
she is not for you .
i am sure the lady knows her own mind . does not she ? let her decide the proper suitor .
she will never be yours ! she said my name ! she remembers !
there , there . . . shhh . . .
quite right !
scandalous ! what would your dear mother say ?
one two three , one two three , twirl two three . . .
and you look so lovely .
he was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a pompous . . . fellow . . .
it is been months . it is not like him .
something s wrong . i know it . i have heard rumors of cholera spreading south from hamburg .
so have i
i should go . i should leave today .
elizabeth . if it is true , travel into germany would be banned . you would never get near ingolstadt . besides , they are only rumors .
and not a word of them to father . he is agitated enough not hearing from victor .
read him one of the old letters and rephrase it . we will say it came today . it will set his mind at ease .
fine .
he set things right with a proper apology . . . and now they have put him in charge of dissection lab !
let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night i left . he is coming home to marry me .
is he not back yet ?
claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time . they say he never arrived .
it is far too late for him to still be out .
are not you ?
nothing can . not ever .
it is not ours to decide . all that live must die . it is god s will .
she was mother to me as well . but ours is the job of the living . it is up to us now to hold this family together . we must think of father and be strong for him . i cannot do that alone .
god took her from us .
he left a beautiful gift in her place . a baby boy . to cherish and love as our very own . your brother
the world is a dizzying place .
he needs to vent his outrage to the skies ! make yourself heard , willie ! learning to walk is not an easy thing ! why should it be so ?
give me that child before you fill his head with drivel !
quite a send off , is not it ?
father s so proud .
and you ?
prouder still . you will be the handsomest student there .
i will have to do better than that .
you will . what do you want , victor ?
to be the best there ever was . to push our knowledge beyond our dreams . . . to eradicate disease and pestilence . . . to purge mankind of ignorance and fear . . .
all my life i have known .
is that what makes it so delicious ?
i wish to be your husband .
i wish to be your wife .
then come with me to ingolstadt . marry me now .
if only i could . but one of us must stay . father s not strong . willie s just a child . who can look after them in your absence ? who can run the estate ?
only you .
i will be here when you return .
not as weak as i .
your decision . for us .
i give you my soul . . .
. . . until our wedding night . when our bodies will join .
victor . i love you ,
elizabeth . my more than sister .
but why risk yourself ? has not this family suffered enough ?
i have no choice
if what you say is true , it is a matter for the police !
they have done a fine job . hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend .
i know only that he is a killer . and i shall bring back his carcass .
i am all right . i am safe ,
it is not something i can explain now . perhaps someday .
what of our marriage ? victor , we have had so much tragedy . i want this family to live again .
so do i .
we need each other now , i need your comfort and strength , not separation and solitude .
a month at most , that is all i ask . elizabeth , please . things have not yet resolved . i must take steps to see that they do . for our family s sake . for our sake . you are life itself . we shall seal our vow . the moment i am done .
why the change ? what about your work ?
it was misguided and pointless . is your answer yes ?
it is
we will leave this afternoon , right after the ceremony . pack only what you need .
does this have something to do with that man you saw ?
yes . we are in danger here . every moment we stay .
victor , tell me why ! trust me !
i do . but you must trust me for now .
now husband and wife .
i have been waiting for this ever since .
open this door for no one !
it would not dare .
they knew the risks when they signed on . i have come too far to turn back now .
then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny .
this ice will break yet . how is our guest ?
he died . raving about phantoms . he was mad , poor devil . gather a detail . have the body removed from my cabin .
aye , captain .
you are saying all disease will eventually be eradicated ?
i am convinced . not by treating symptoms , but by diving nature s most jealously guarded secrets .
do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes ?
no . but someday .
thank goodness . we would be out of work .
oh god .
very well then .
as a march hare .
of course i am . it pays to humor the insane .
victor , victor frankenstein .
i know . you have a way of making an impression .
come now . magnus ? agrippa ? next thing you know , you will be teaching toadstools to speak .
can you think of a better reason ?
quite a few .
do me a favor then . . . . . . keep them to yourself .
you are a comfort to me , henry .
what now ? writing about it in your journal will not help .
it is a letter to my father .
these are exciting times , henry . we are entering an era of amazing breakthroughs . look at edward jenner . he was not content to bleed people with leeches , he pioneered a new frontier of thought
. . . yes , and thanks to him , smallpox has been virtually eliminated . i have heard this speech before .
but you have not listened , never in history has so much seemed possible . we are on the verge of answers undreamt of . . . but only if we have the courage to ask the questions .
somebody has to !
nothing in moderation , clerval .
he was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance .
they will hang him all the same .
good . i will be there to hear his worthless neck snap .
it was wrong , henry ! it should not have happened ! the bastard deserves to die .
why waldman ? he of all people should have cheated death !
you cannot . death is god s will !
i resent god s monopoly .
that is blasphemy !
blasphemy be damned ! waldman spent his life trying to help people !
all the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor !
no . he had more important work .
there are sick people who need our help . here and now . not in some future time . consider that .
i have been preoccupied .
we all know how hard you took waldmangs death . even krempe is sympathetic . but it is time to move on . it is time to concern yourself with life .
that is my concern . i am involved in something just now . i want to finish it in waldmangs memory .
how much longer ?
few months perhaps . i am gathering the raw materials even now .
things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak . thousand new cases a day now . classes have been suspended . university s shut down .
yes ? and ?
listen to what i am saying . the militia s arriving to quarantine the city . most of us are getting out while we still can .
you will be leaving then . just as well . you never were cut out for this , henry . goodbye .
a . . . week ?
we feared cholera . turned out to be pneumonia , brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm .
is that your diagnosis ?
mine and professor krempe s . we have been trading off nursing you in shifts . the rest of the time we are out working with the cholera victims . it is his turn for that just now .
you have been going round the clock ?
we catch a few hours sleep where we can . usually here at your bedside .
everything in moderation , clerval .
nothing in moderation , frankenstein .
no . they do not .
victor . this place looked like a charnel house . what went on here ?
thank you , henry .
for what ?
this . my home . my family . if not for you , i would be dead in a burial pit somewhere .
i did not find what i was looking for .
yes , do not worry . i will look after your father . you look after her .
i will be back as soon as i have got her far away and safe . we will hunt this fiend down together .
only if you will tell me who he is .
i owe you that . done .
let it go .
and is it true , miss moritz , that you love victor frankenstein ? that your heart was broken ? answer the question . do you love victor frankenstein ?
is it also not true that you murdered his brother william in a misdirected crime of passion ?
murder willie ? in my heart , he was our child . victor s and mine . such a thing could never have entered my mind .
so you have claimed . yet you have no explanation for this . the locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder . the locket you so coveted . how did it come to be in your possession ?
i have no knowledge of that .
but surely , professor , you do not intend we disregard the more . . . philosophical works .
philosophical ?
those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect . paracelsus , for one .
or albertus magnus . cornelius agrippa . . .
what is your name ?
victor frankenstein , sir . of geneva .
of geneva . tell me , mr . frankenstein of geneva . do you wish to study medicine ? or mysticism ?
despite the lack of challenge .
victor , explain yourself .
krempe has a way of provoking my temper .
you have a way of provoking his . i have been watching you . you seem impatient with your studies .
to say the least . i came here to expand my mind , but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn . all we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new .
you disdain accepted wisdom ?
no , i embrace it . . . as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known .
i once saw it done , as a boy in canton . my parents were missionaries . the cure was nothing short of miraculous . i have never forgotten it . been fascinated ever since .
it is utterly fantastic ! this is the sort of thing i am talking about ! we should be learning this !
why ? god alone knows what it means . until it has proven value , it is nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick . hardly fit for the classroom .
but the possibilities . combining ancient knowledge with new ? something like this could change our fundamental views !
it is a thrilling direction to explore . thrilling and dangerous . nature can be wonderful and terrible . science is not a realm for the reckless it needs a conscience . we must proceed cautiously . assess as we go . what i do on my own time is my own business . the same holds true for you . you wish to expand your mind ? fine , do so . you can even join me here , if you like . but not at the expense of your normal studies .
i doubt that decision is still mine to make .
nonsense . tonight you will draft an apology to professor krempe . . .
why ?
our profession needs talent like yours . destroy your career over an issue of pride ? what a waste .
numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system ?
the strain was evident .
oh , now you have gone too far . there s only one god , victor .
i am . . . dying .
are you a physician ?
how is it you come to be here ?
there s a startling question , coming from you . i am captain of this ship . we sailed from archangel a month ago , seeking a passage to the north pole .
ah . an explorer .
would be . i am plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment .
i heard .
i cannot say i blame them . we are trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of . . . creature .
creature ? a . . . human like creature ?
you know of it ?
your men are right to be afraid .
then explain it , whatever it is . it could save the voyage . i have spent years planning this . my entire fortune .
you would persist at the cost of your own life ? the lives of your crew ?
lives are ephemeral . the knowledge we gain , the achievements we leave behind . . . those live on .
madness ?
who are you ?
my name is frankenstein . . .
it will be all right . i will take care of you .
jack ? marcie ? ned ?
no , no , they are all dead . . .
bill bill bill is out there . . .
i will protect you .
maybe we should wait for mr . christy .

it is long and personal . it has nothing to do with you or the other kids .
maybe i can help ?
you are right . it makes no sense .
artist .
i walked into it knowing i would get hurt , but i thought i could stand anything . i just was not ready for that kind of pain . we were supposed to meet in l . a . when i got back there , he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife .
i do not know .
almost five .
and then steve looks at you with those hurt eyes like you do not care about children . . .
slipped in . probably liked the scent of your perfume .
bad bulb or no power . it is getting a little gloomy in here .
not if they are where i think they are .
good point .
well , it has not been that long .
absolutely .
cannot hear anything through that wind and rain .
it sounded like brenda .
i will go take a look .

they are off now .
okay .
marcie ?
hey , guys !
do you have a dime ? a quarter ?
no . there must be some in the desk somewhere .
wet . i do not know .
it is over twenty miles to the crossroads . steve will be back in an hour . things will straighten out then . we will take his jeep and get help .
some campers drowned . then some counselors got killed .

a short somewhere .

get behind him more .
i will spot you five points .
where is ned ?
i do not believe you . . .
want to see my trick shot ? it is even better .
god , but i love that sexy talk .
dancer .
we would not want you thinking you are the only show off in camp , would we ?
whatever you make yourself .
that was the telephone .
ha ! you wily oriental ! the phone was mr . watson , come in here , i need you . what hath god wrought was the telegraph .
sometimes i only think about kissing women .
i was just wondering if you thought there would by any other gorgeous women at camp crystal lake . besides yourself .
quote controlled substances are expressly forbidden . possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal . unquote .
coach , athletic director somewhere .
wait , wait ! when i was finding these goodies in the shed . i also found this letter which a camper never sent home . listen .
god , but i love that macho talk ! emergency generators ! the indian used campfires .
good call .
boy , we sure do have a lot of filthy small minded people around here . wait a minute , i will get my diaphragm and be right with you .
makes me want to hold on and never let go .
i love you .
i love you .
i do not love neddy .
he keeps on acting like such an asshole !
ned !
do not call him .
i thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures . ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do , you know .
i guess . . .
i am a little scared of storms . always have been . since i was a kid .
you ? the brick ?
i call it my shower dream .
lead the way !
just a little . wait a minute , woman .
mmmmmmmph .
best over . . .
umhummmmph .
like waves . it is never been likes waves before .
whassamatta ?

there you are dead wrong .
yeah , and it also look like it has not seen a coat of paint in six years .
girls cannot be cowboys .
okay , fireman .
rocky road .
frankly , scarlet , i do not give a damn !
those things can be nasty .
but it is in the brochure ! camp crystal lake has a full drama program . you just saw it .
no , thanks . i am fine . sandy .
you cannot go back there tonight . not in that stuff . less you wanta get drownded .
i got to .
aw .
they will be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain .
how much do i owe you ?
one night on the town .
i mean . . .
. . . i know what you mean . two and a quarter . plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone .
that is thirty percent .
for two lonely nights .
i think water got into the electrical system . you ride me back to camp ? i will get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning .
why not ?
you have made a science out of coincidence .
sure .
another coincidence .
yeah .
just my son and i .
what is your purpose in mexico ?
vacation . i am taking him to see his first bullfight .
oh , that is just my daughter in the bathroom .
you said it was just you and your son .
i meant me , my son and my daughter .
open the door . i am coming aboard .
why the fuck , outta all the god forsaken shit holes in mexico , did you have us rendezvous at that place ?
i do not know , one place s as good as another .
have you ever been there before ?
no , but i passed by it a couple of times . it is out in the middle of nowhere . it seems like a rowdy place , so there would not be a lot of police . and it is open from dusk till dawn . you said meet you in the morning .
well , because you picked that place out of a hat , my brother s dead now . and this girl s family s dead .
did they look like psychos ? they were fucking vampires . psychos do not explode when sunlight hits em , i do not care how crazy they are .
you cannot , but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at el ray is a good start .
twenty eight .
jesus christ , carlos , my brother s dead and he is not coming back , and it is all your fault . twenty .
i said new , this is an .
it is hardly been used at all . i got it from a drug dealer who only drove it times in as many years . swear to god . that is like new .
so do i just follow you ?
yeah , follow us .
so let s do it .
vamanos !
stop ? we are not going to actually stop at a motel , are we ?
the truth hurts .
i am exhausted .
lie in the back , dad , i will drive us into mexico .
i have no idea .
i am gonna try and get us across the border .
no , dad , you gotta tell em that they are back there .
they are gonna kill us . they get us across the border , they are gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us .
if they get over the border , they are gonna let us go .
dad , i watch those reality shows . they never let anybody go . any cop will tell you , in a situation like this , you get a chance , you go for it . this is our chance .
what about kate ?
they are gonna kill her anyway . at least now with all these cops we have got a fighting chance .
son , i have this situation under control . i know exactly what i am doing . you are going to have to trust me on this .
if trusting you means trusting those fucking killers , i cannot do that . if you do not tell the cops , i will .
he is running the show .
i am running the show . i make the plays , and you back the plays i make . stop thinking with your fucking balls . kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ai not the time to go for it . i need your cover . cover my ass .
it is not suicide if you are already dead . two . . .
okay , i will kill you when you change , i swear to god in jesus christ s name .
thank you , son .
to keep the daylight out ! this is where they sleep ! get to the door !
jacob .
okay , jacob , get up and sit your ass down on the bed . make a wrong move and i will shoot you in the face .
he is my son .
how does that happen ? you do not look japanese .
neither does he . he looks vietnamese .
oh , well , excuse me all to hell .
that is this about , money ?
it is about money , all right , but not yours . you see , me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance .
just listen to daddy , sugar , and do not do nothing stupid . you two , simon says sit the fuck down !
on the dresser .
richie , take the keys . start that big bastard up , and drive it up front .
come again ?
if you are taking people , take me . but my kids are not going anywhere with you .
sorry , i need everybody .
my children are not going with you , and that is that .
that is not fucking that . . . this is fucking this . go sit over there .
good . your old mangs all right , he just saved your life .
scott and kate .
my wife .
where is the little lady ?
in heaven .
she is dead ?
yes , she is .
how would she die ?
auto wreck .
come on , gimme some more details . how would it happen ? some fucking drunk kill her ?
no . it was a rainy night , the brakes on the car were not great . she had to stop suddenly . she slid on the road , she crashed , she died .
died instantly ?
not quite . she was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on .
whewww ! those acts of god really stick it in and break it off , do not they ?
yes , they do .
yes .
i have seen one of these before . a friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion . away to fuck the irs . is that what you are doing , or are you the real mccoy ?
real mccoy .
you are a preacher ?
i was a minister .
was ? as in not anymore ?
yes .
why would ya quit ?
i think i have gotten about as up close and personal with you as i am gonna get . now if you need me like i think you need me , you are not gonna kill me cause i will not answer your stupid , prying questions . so , with all due respect , mind your own business .
i seem to have touched a nerve . do not be so sensitive , pops , let s keep this friendly . but you are right , enough with the getting to know you shit . now , there s two ways we can play this hand . one way is me and you go round ang round all fucking night . the other way , is we reach some sort of an understanding . now , if we go down that first path at the end of the day , i will win . but we go down the second , we will both win . now , i do not give a rat s ass about you or your fucking family . y all can live forever or die this second and i do not care which . the only things i do care about are me that son of a bitch in the back , and our money . and right now i need to get those three things into mexico . now , stop me if i am wrong , but i take it you do not give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice , or the bank getting its money back . right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter , your son and possibly yourself . am i correct ?
yes .
i thought so . you help us get across the border without incident , stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny , and in the morning we will let you and your family go . that way everybody gets what they want . you and your kids get out of this alive and we get into mexico . everybody s happy .
how do i know you will keep your word ?
jesus christ , pops , do not start with this shit .
you want me to sit here and be passive . the only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if i believe you will let us go . i am not there yet . you have to convince me you are telling the truth .
look , dickhead , the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you are stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters . i do not wanna hafta worry about you all fucking night . and i do not think you wanna be worrying about my brother s intentions toward your daughter all night . you notice the way he looked at her , did not ya ?
yes .
did not like it , did ya ?
no , i did not .
did not think so . so , as i was saying , i am willing to make a deal . you behave , get us into mexico , and do not try to escape . i will keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning .
you will not let him touch her ?
i can handle richie , do not worry .
fair enough . you break your word , i will kill all of you . kate , honey !
i swear to god i will not try to escape and i will do my best to get you into mexico .
you best better get it done , pops .
as long as you are cool , she will be cool . what are ya gonna say ?
i do not have the slightest idea .
well , you just keep thinking of that gun next to kate s temple .
pops , when you are right , you are right , and you are right .
then stop , cause that is where we are going .
shit , i been to bars make this place look like a fucking h club .
pass .
why not , against your religion ?
no , i do drink , i am just not drinking now .
suit yourself , more for me . scotty ?
i am still stewing about that ape laying hands on me . and that fucking bartender sticks a weed up my ass , too .
he backed down .
he is smiling at us . but behind his smile , he is saying , fuck you jack . i hear that loud and clear .
what are you going to do ?
i am gonna just sit here and drain this bottle . and when i have drunk the last drop , if i still feel then , the way i feel now , i am gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head .
before we stepped in here , you told all of us to be cool . that means you , too .
i never said do what i do , i said do what i say .
are you so much a fucking loser , you cannot tell when you have won ?
nothing . i did not make a statement . i asked a question . would you like me to ask it again ? very well . are you such a loser you cannot tell when you have won ? the entire state of texas , along with the fbi , is looking for you . did they find you ? no . they could not . they had every entrance to the border covered . there s no way you could get across . did you ? yes , you did . you have won , seth , enjoy it .
to yours .
forever together .
yeah , i know that is going on . we got a bunch of fucking vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fucking blood ! that is it , plain and simple . and i do not wanna hear any bullshit about i do not believe in vampires because i do not fucking believe in vampires either . but i do believe in my own two fucking eyes , and with my two eyes i saw fucking vampires ! now , does everybody agree we are dealing with vampires .
i am like you . i do not believe in vampires , but i believe in what i saw .
good for you . now , since we all believe we are dealing with vampires , what do we know about vampires ? crosses hurt vampires . do you have a cross ?
in the winnebago .
in other words , no .
that is an official cross ? some piece of tin made in taiwan ? what makes that official ? if a cross works against vampires , it is not the cross itself , it is what the cross represents . the cross is a symbol of holiness .
okay , i will buy that . so we got crosses covered , moving right along , what else ?
yep .
you bet your sweet ass you are , and i am gonna help you do it . but we ai not got much time .
my guess is that this little dive s been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime . this is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks .
well , i say lets tear this place apart for weapons . so when they burst through that door , we will make em wish they never did .
i do not give a shit about living or dying anymore . i just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as i can .
amen .
kate , scott ?
you two ought to start a stand up act , because you are just wasting your humor on me .
ai not it the truth .
hey , if we go to a motel , we can swim .
that is very nice of ted , but i will call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting .
i did not want to talk about this in front of scott because he gets upset . but you do not believe in god anymore ?
not enough to be a pastor . look , i know this is hard on you kids . after jenny s death , this is probably the last thing you need . but i cannot do it any longer . my congregation needs spiritual leadership . well , they cannot get that from me anymore . my faith is gone . to answer your question , yes , i do believe in jesus . but do i love them ? no . after jenny died , i just thought , that is the point ?
it is just , all our lives you have been a pastor . for twenty years you have preached trust in the lord . and then one day you wake up and say fuck him ?
i did not say fuck him . i am just not connected anymore .
that happens , you will get it back .
kate , give your old man a little credit . every person who chooses the service of god as their life s work has something in common . i do not care if you are a preacher , a priest , a nun , a rabbi or a buddhist monk . many , many times during your life you will look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself , am i a fool ? we have all done it . i am not going through a lapse . what i have experienced is closer to awakening . i am not trying to shake your faith . i have just decided not to devote my life to god anymore .
what do you think mom would say ?
mom s got nothing to say , she is dead .
it is a flop house .
it is not a flop house . it is basic and simple . that does not make it a flop house .
if it does not have a pool , we are looking for a new place .
other places have beds , they also have cable tv , a gym , room service . . .
so all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door .
no , i am not . i have been bit . in effect , i am already dead .
scott ?
okay , okay , i promise i will do it !
not good enough , swear to god .
i swear to god , our father , that when you change into one of the undead , i will kill you .
good girl . now , scott , we have even less time , so i am only giving you the count of three . one . . .
no !
everybody goes home !
we are having a wet bikini contest , and you just won .
sure .
where are you taking us ?
mexico .
that is in mexico ?
mexicans .
in the room . were you serious , or were you just fooling around ? i am just bringing it up , cause if you really want me to do that for you , i will .
do what ?
what you said to me in the room .
what did i say ?
you asked me if i would
the sword of damocles is lifted from above seth s head . he is just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable . he knows exactly how he is going to cross the border . whistling a happy tune , he turns and walks back into room .
yes .
do you believe me ?
yes .
you damn well better . go .
you must have a bible in here , do not cha ?
yeah , we got a bible .
get it and bring it up here , will ya , please ?
in the morning , darling , in the morning , we are g o n e and you are f r e e . now , i know i put you guys through hell , and i know i have been one rough pecker , but from here on end you guys are in my cool book . scotty , help me pick richie up , and lay him down . jacob , keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says , digayo . when you get to digayo , turn this big bastard left , go on down for a few miles , then you see a bar called the titty twister . from what i hear , you cannot miss it .
okay .
peachy ! why should not i be ? the world s my oyster , except for the fact that i just rammed a wooden stake in my brother s heart because he turned into a vampire , even though i do not believe in vampires . aside from that unfortunate business , everything s hunky dory .
i am really sorry .
bullshit ! you hate us . if you had half a chance you would feed us to them !
daddy s dead .
noooo !
anytime .
not many .
well , when you run out of weapons , just start cold cocking em . make em sing for their supper .
you use em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you .
me too .
later .
you got your microwave
you got your sink
you got your shower
see this , television !
feel this , real wood paneling . that is real wood , too , not that fake stuff .
agent chase , does it appear that they are heading for mexico .
yes , it does , kelly . we have already alerted the mexican authorities . they intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice .
are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in abilene , gloria hill ?
we have received no news one way or the other . we can only hope for the best .
what about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot ?
this cannot be confirmed at this time , but we do believe it to be true . we have reason to believe it was the youngest brother richard , and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store s clerk .
is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers , that the bureau , the rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally ?
i would say that is a very safe assumption .
have not felt it a bit . been inside with the air conditioner blasting all day long .
not even for lunch ?
i am by myself today , ate my lunch outta the microwave .
whatsamatter ?
awww , it is just been a shitass day . every inch of it hot and miserable . first off , nadine at the blue chip got some sorta sick , so that mongoloid boy of hers was working the grill . that fucking idiot do not know rat shit from rice krispies . i ate breakfast at nine , was puking up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty .
is not there a law or something against retards serving food to the public ?
well , if there ai not there sure oughta be . who knows what goes on inside mongoloid s mind ?
you could sue the shit out of her , ya know . that kid belongs under a circus tent , not flipping burgers . you could own that fucking place .
what the hell would i do with that grease pit ? besides , nadine s got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head . then all this abilene shit happened . you heard about that bank robbery in abilene , did not ya ?
that is all that is been on the box all day . they killed some people did not they ?
four rangers , three cops , and two civilians . and they took a lady bank teller as a hostage .
knock yourself out .
six fifty .
letting him use your toilet ? no store does that .
he comes in here every day and we bullshit . he is used my toilet a thousand times . if i told him no , he would know something was up .
i want that son of a bitch out outta here , in his car , and down the road or you can change the name of this place to benny s world of blood .
what ? are you kidding ? i did not do anything !
i was not scratching !
you calling him a liar ?
well that do not matter now , cause you got about two fucking seconds to live ! richie !
you cannot come in here .
what dya mean ?
this is a private club . you are not welcome .
are you telling me i am not good enough to drink here ?
this bar is for bikers and truckers only . you , get out !
i kinda doubt that . we are grabbing a table , send over a waitress to take our order .
he signaled the ranger .
seth , he did it . you were by the beer cooler with your back turned . i was by the magazines , i could see his face . and i saw him mouth
you believe me do not cha ?
shut up and start the car .
i am not dead , but i am definitely shot ! i told you that bastard said , help us !
when i count three , shoot out the bottles behind him !
gotcha !
one . . . two . . . three .
what am i supposed to do , seth ? he recognized us .
he did not recognize shit .
no .
do they have an x rated channel ?
no .
do they have a waterbed ?
they do not have anything except four walls and a roof , and that is all we need .
how ya think , it hurts like a son of a bitch .
feels good .
i am gonna go get the money .
that is their standard deal , brother . they ai not about to change it for us .
did you even to try to negotiate ?
these guys ai not spic firecracker salesman from tijuana . they do not even know the meaning of the word barter . you wanna stay in el ray ? you give them thirty percent of your loot . it is scripture . so it is written , so shall it be done . you want sanctuary , you pay the price , and the price is thirty percent .
all i am saying
this conversation is over .
sight seeing .
what would ya see ?
cops .
didya look at the border ?
they are going to apprehend us in forty eight hours .
look , fuck the border . let s just dig in and wait for things to cool down .
richie , it is gonna get a lot fucking worse before it gets any fucking better . we showed our ass in texas . we killed texas fucking rangers . they ai not gonna stop looking till they find us , and when they find us , they are gonna kill us . texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers . the el paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us .
how do you know ?
i heard it on the radio . we gotta get our asses into mexico tonight . carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side , then carlos and his boys will escort us to el ray and
what ?
she is in the other room .
what the fuck is she doing there ? !
there s nothing wrong with me , brother . that woman tried to escape and i did what i had to do .
no . that woman would not of said shit if she had a mouthful .
wrong , wrong , wrong , wrong , wrong , wrong , wrong ! once you left , she became a whole different person .
is it me ? is it my fault ?
it is not your fault , it is her fault !
what ?
this is not me ! i am a professional fucking thief . i steal money . you try to stop me , god help you . but i do not kill people i do not have to , and i do not rape women . what you doing ai not how it is done . do you understand ?
seth , if you were me
just say yes ! nothing else , just say yes .
yes .
yes , seth , i understand .
yes , seth , i understand .
what ?
shut up . it is gonna work just fine ,
i just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea .
duly noted . now , shut up .
as long as you do not act like a fucking nut , we will be just fine .
what does that mean ?
what ?
no , i did not .
yes , you did . you said as long as i do not act like a fucking nut , implying that i have been acting like a fucking nut .
take a pill , kid . i just meant stay cool .
you meant that , but you meant the other , too .
fuck those spic pigs ! you called me a fucking nut , and where i come from , that stops the train on its tracks .
keep your voice down .
or what ?
this ai not the time .
oh , i know , was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and i broke it out ? yeah , you are right , that was pretty fucking nutty . not to mention stupid . but you know what ? i can fix that right now .
yeah , i think so . what happened ?
i do not know , you just passed out .
i did ?
yeah , we were just standing there . you said something about your shoulder hurting , then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes .
really ?
yeah , when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard . it scared the shit outta me . sure you are okay ?
yeah , i guess . i am just a little fucked up .
well , let me tell ya something , gonna clear your head right up . we are officially mexicans .
what ?
we are . . . south of the border down mexico way .
we are ?
yep . we are heading for the rendezvous right now . we get there , we pound booze till carlos shows up , he escorts us to el ray . and then me and you , brother , kick fucking back . how ya like them apples ?
they broke when you fell .
oh , fuck , seth , that is my only pair !
do not worry about it , we will get you some glasses .
what dya mean , do not worry about it . of course i am gonna worry about it , i cannot fucking see .
when we get to el ray , i will take care of it .
yeah , like a mexican hole in the wall s gonna have my fucking prescription .
it is not a big deal , unless you make it a big deal . now , i am real happy , richie , stop bringing me down with bullshit .
that is how you are looking , richie .
i am looking scared ?
that is what you look like .
you know what you look like ?
no , richie , what do i look like ?
you are looking green .
where are you right now ?
what do you mean ?
where are you ?
i am here with you .
no , you are not . you are sipping margaritas in el ray . but we are not in el ray . we are here getting ready to go in there . you are so pleased with yourself about getting into mexico , you think the job s down . it ai not . get back on the clock . that is a fuck with you bar . we hang around there for a coupla hours , in all likelihood , we will get fucked with . so get your shit together , brother .
my shit is together .
it do not look together .
well , it is . just because i am happy does not mean i am on vacation . you are just not used to seeing me happy , cause it is been about fifteen fucking years since i been happy . but my shit is forever together .
yeah .
well , then ask her , dumb ass .
por favor , senorita . would you care to join us ?
scarred for life , that is how i am !
okay , i will have one .
yeah , it is mine .
go out and bring it in . i feel a song coming on .
actually , our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man . he is a preacher .
he needs our help !
he is beyond our help . you saw him get bit . i saw him get bit . we all saw it . you cannot help him . i have got no one left to lose but you . i cannot be alone again . we are sticking together .
thank you , ensign .
no problem , lieutenant .
that is what i hear .
can i ask you something , lieutenant ? how come you are doing this ? i mean , we are kinda curious .
who s we ?
just some of the women .
i have been accused of that wish .
the woman i saw you with . . .
just a friend . we have friends , too , you know .
but are there . . . i mean , how many . . .
more than you would guess . it is just that we do not hold coffee klatches . if more then three of us get together at any one time , the guys think it is some kind of uprising .
do not say my name .
who s . . . lieuten
or rank . but can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order ?
okay , but . . . you did not have to do what you did . not for me .
wickwire , thomas dane . see what you can find .
who signed as his sponsoring officer ?
uh . . . do not see it . there s no signature . but hang on there s a note to see addendum . checking . . .
what would you find , kathy ?
senator , they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses
and now i got reporters from toadsquat , iowa , calling my office and asking what i know about this g . i . jane thing .
nothing i can do about it unless you are suggesting i infringe on their civil liberties which i would happily do if you will just trim a little fat off the constitution .
are you truly mouthing off to a senior member of the senate arms committee ? i mean , i will give you points for style just nothing for smarts .
your prerogative , senator .
awright . how is our girl doing , anyway ?
standing right here in my office .
jordan , dear . how are they treating you ?
security ? what the hell you talking about ? your base is not secure ?
of course , but there s more
then set out the good plates , we will all have lunch . my office will follow up with details . jumping off , now . . .
thank you , sir .
would you care for a beverage ? tea ?
i am fine , sir .
so . we are still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this for integrating the spec recon training . it may not always be smooth , but we are trying to make it as painless as possible for you .
thank you , sir . but i expect a certain amount of pain .
do not worry about it . if it is off your collar and out of your eyes , that is all i am going to ask .
really , i have no problem with
i am not out to change your sex , lieutenant . you will have separate beds , separate heads . if you have specific medical needs , inform the infirmary . if a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner , please inform me immediately so i can deal with it immediately . questions ?
none at this time , sir .
then that is all i have to say . dismissed .
if you were like everyone else , lieutenant , i suspect we would not be making statements about not making statements , would we ? take your leave .
did not take long .
it is you , sir . and it started the day i came here .
oh , really .
it is this double standard , the separate quarters , the deferential treatment . it is how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met .
because i was civil , now you are complaining .
i cannot afford civility , sir . how am i supposed to fit in with these guys when you have got me set up as an outsider ? even if i make it under these rules , i still lose , because there will always be a flag in my file yeah , she made it , but . . . i mean , really why did not you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base ?
did you just have a brain fart ?
pardon ?
did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander ? if so , i regard that as a bonafide brain fart , and i resent it when people fart inside my home .
i think you have resented me from the start , sir .
no , sir .
no , sir , what ?
the shape does not bother me . it is just that goddamn rotten stench .
same rules for everyone , sir .
straight up ?
across the board , sir .
and if you just happen to wash out , i will not have to contend with you bitching to some hairy chested female senator ? and please note i did not identify any one in particular .
would not dream of it , sir .
so i will get a fair shot ?
you will get everything you want , o neil . let s see if you want what you are gonna get .
you making friends with the press , lieutenant ?
we will all have lunch . good idea . oh , and let s be sure to invite this sociologist , too just in case we want to have a fucking bridge game afterwards !
permission to evaporate , o neil .
sir , if someone is suggesting that i am a lesbian , they are wrong .
i find this as distasteful as you , lieutenant . but if it is on my desk , it is on my shoulders . there s going to be an inquiry it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty . you should prepare yourself .
sir , please . . . if there s any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud . . .
i do not see how , o neil . dismissed .
i am not sure what
would you have the discretion to end it right then and there ?
sir ? what did he say ?
basically he asked me if i could unring a bell .
sir . . .
motherachrist . . .
no problem , sir !
entering my scan now . . .
west ?
smoke her .
i ai not gonna shoot her .
only blanks . lemme do it .
hey . ai not your call , man .
fuck me .
o neil . our air s gonna crap out as soon as we get down there . you know that , do not you ?
i will act surprised .
congress and the pentagon share a lot of plumbing . they will never know whose leak it is .
did you hear ?
she made it through s . e . r . e . training . got a call this morning from
not that . the white house just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would , in one stroke , void all remaining elements of the combat exclusion laws .
whoa , whoa , whoa . land based maritime specialties . gimme a second here to de euphemize that . . .
well , i am just an old dame without much time left , so you will pardon me if i jump right in here before they discontinue my blood type . i am deeply concerned over the navy s seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military . case in point . . .
madam senator . . . this is an internal document of the u . s . navy . i must seriously question whether
the navy s conclusion regarding the crash of an f aboard an aircraft carrier . female aviator , it just so happens . you are familiar with this report and its conclusion , am i right ?
i was one member of the investigating commission .
yes , i see your signature right here twice the size of everyone else s . and your conclusion was pilot error , hmm ?
i am really not prepared for any kind of in depth review of
i would like to think our next secretary of the navy would be prepared for anything , mr . hayes .
that aside for the moment , i am struck by the tenor , the ill spirit of your report . . . the degrading remarks by other aviators . . . innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations . . . even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior . in my seven years on this committee , i have never seen a downed aviator treated like this . never . i am deeply disturbed by this report , mr . hayes . not just what it bodes for women in the military but for your own confirmation as well .
thank you , ma am . um , may i ask what this is regarding ?
high school pentathlete . . . rotc scholarship , graduated with honors . . . top marks in basic training . . . and , as it just so happens , a constituent of my home state of virginia . oh , the things i will do for one extra vote .
california .
i know that , sir . ma am . it is just that . . . begging your pardon , senator , but . . . do you understand that this involves combat training ?
this is just a test case , o neil . but if it works out if you work out it could well change the navy s official policy on women in combat . or , actually , its official non policy . now who s your immediate superior there ?
captain dwyer . technically .
my office will fill him in and help expedite . look forward to meeting you at the proper time . jumping off now . . .
uh , question , ma am .
yes , dear .
would i be the only one ? the only woman ?
there will be more to follow but yes , dear , right now you are the pick of a very large litter . and your success would mean a lot . jumping , now . . .
hmmm . maybe i will ask when i see you in person .
uh , ma am .
gonna be visiting that all womangs america s cup team in a few weeks if i were a gambler , i would say dennis o conner s days are numbered . but they are in san diego , so i thought i would take a quick promenade of the base .
lieutenant thomas wickwire .
sounds familiar .
it should . you nominated him for spec recon just three days after you nominated me .
jordan . might we do this over lunch tomorrow ? i do very much want to talk , but now is scarcely
did you set me up ? did you set me up just to see me fail ?
absolutely not .
what changed ?
should probably ask him that .
if i have to ask again , senator , i will be asking in front of cameras .
what he did was light the bandwagon on fire . because he knows what i know that american families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm s way .
you do not know that .
in face , i do roper , harris , gallop they all come back the same .
what are you saying ? that a womengs life is more valuable than a mangs ? that a womengs death hurts a family more ?
i am saying it is not going to happen . not when the president is set to turn this into a third rail issue should i choose to ever campaign against him . he will fry me six ways to sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war and , quite possibly , for bringing them back in body bags .
jordan . i do not expect you to fully understand this but sometimes there s more to be gained from the fight than the victory .
so the rhetoric gets you headlines . but the reality gets you in trouble .
the reality is this we send far too many men off to war . i do not need to compound the problem with women . can you honestly tell me you wanted that life ? squat pissing in some third world jungle with
i wanted the choice . the chance to prove myself , my skills , my work , me . that is how it should have been .
you promise wickwire a fast ticket , too ?
i have had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began . and that is quite verifiable .
i am sure it is .
you will think about my offer ?
you know , i wonder what the secnav would think about it . if i spoke with him .
well , i spoke with mr . hayes this morning myself and told him the deal was off . no more test cases . he was only too happy to oblige . do not play politics with me , little darling . you would be up way past your bedtime .
i would go special reconnaissance . every bit as tough and we have a percent drop out rate among the men .
then i suggest we start there .
does not matter who she picks . no woman is going to last one week in a commando training course . and i do not care who it is .
i think it is more important , sir , to decide what we are going to do since it is apparent this issue is not going away quietly .
g . i . jane . and which one of you told me she would not last a week ? huh ?
it is really f . lee montgomery but that gets whittled down to just flea . for short , ma am .
so it really has nothing to do with actual brain size ?
no , ma am .
well , flea , i appreciate the respect you just showed me . but i do not need it and do not want it not that kind of respect , anyway . it is just gonna hurt us both , okay ?
i will work on it , ma am .
do that .
snot me . it is him .
fuck . basher basher , this is ground crew six requesting emergency extraction . stand by for a prc fix . . .
flea , cool , cortez , newman take your minis , hit the water . go , go !
spotted you , chief . pri one is to slip you some air , so we are coming down with a tank just something until the a team shows . over .
i can make this wall without
. . . two . . . one . . . mark !
if you cannot feel the other guy s pecker , you ai not in tight enough ! i want nuts to butts !
come on , montgomery . . .
flea ! o neil ! why is there a break in that line ?
sir ?
you are wanted at the c . o . s .
check your watch , pyro . seems fast .
every class has its surprises , pyro . this one will be no different .
get it up !
you broke a dozen training rules back there before i lost count .
i have had it . just because they pay me like a baby sitter does not mean i am gonna be one .
she is a trainee , just like the others . why are you coming down so hard ?
she is an officer . there s a higher standard .
she is a women , and that is why you are riding her bareback .
of course it is . and i am gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal rights thing , that real lives are gonna be lost . maybe mine , maybe yours .
i oughtta report you .
i think you probably would if you did not know i was right .
not doing them very fine , o neil .
i will try anyway , sir .
you will try what we tell you to try , o neil . go regulation .
what all females ? if i am the only
i believe he earned it for saving a mangs life in saudi arabia . he wanted you to have it . he was very clear on that point .
i was looking for him earlier , but . . .
the chief was granted early retirement as of hundred yesterday . by hundred he was gone . out of the navy .
just a coincidence ?
maybe it is not my place to speculate on his private thoughts . but i think the chief knew that his way his world had come and gone .
gotta situation here . where are you ? stuck in traffic ?
not due in for minutes , sir . watcha got ?
signals received only sparingly , in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries .
chances of recovery ?
you are the analyst for east china , o neil . analyze .
halfway round the world . so that is the problem we can get the team in , just not out .
unless you whiskey run .
blank faces here , o neil .
quick hit technique used by capone . rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles . all his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride . check the files dprk i doped it out as a contingency plan seal team infiltrates , picks up the package , links up with recovery sub . but do not waste time opening and closing hatches . they just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters .
only four minutes to neutral waters , sir . why not ?
thank you , sir . we hear back from the pentagon ?
probably hear back from cnn first .
hate this part . just sweating it out on the sidelines .
intel has its own glory , lieutenant no matter how subtle .
is this my glory , sir ?
just like you would be .
spec recon . those guys are world class warriors . and they will not want you there , jordan .
i take it you do not either . feet .
royce . we are the same age , we started the same time and now you are sitting in the upperdecks while i am still down in the bullpen . what does that tell you about the navy ?
she is haze grey and underway . . .
you need operational duty to really advance . . . you need combat training to go operational . . . yet combat training is off limits to people with tits . i am topped out at intel . forget the glass ceiling i am beating my head on a big brass ceiling .
so dump on me .
this has nothing to do with you .
well , guess i do not even need to be here . . .
get your dick back here . it has everything to do with you .
you are such a ball breaker sometimes . especially at night .
sorry . but after our days . . . so if i try this thing . . . if i ship out to coronado . . . what happens here ?
i will try to keep the door open . if you wash out , i make it so that
wai , wait . what happens if it works ? four months of training , three years of operational duty . what then ?
i do not feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life , jordan . maybe we should just let it happen .
which is guy speak for . . .
sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth . but i am trying to be honest , okay ? three years is a long time . do not ask me to predict how i will feel then , jordan , because i do not know . and either do you .
you know , right up until you said that i thought i did know .
thank you , royce . it was shaping up like such a tough call and then you go and make it so goddamn easy . really , thank you so much .
it is hard to find time to sleep , royce . much less keep up with my phone life .
how hard they making it on you ?
i feel like there s men here , there s women here then there s men . but hey , what would i expect ?
me ? why me ?
do not you know ? how they are talking about you ?
i saw an article . . .
i cannot walk two blocks in washington without hearing about g . i . jane . you are all over the place , and whether you wanted it or not , the feminists are sizing you up for that poster .
big symbols make big targets , jordan . i think someone s gunning for you .
you know , royce , i got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets , too .
i am only trying to warn you in case
well , let me warm you i am going though with this . the more everybody fucks with me , fucks with my head , the more it just makes me want to finish . so do not expect me back crying in your arms any time soon , okay ?
that is not what i want , jordan . i mean . . . it is and it is not . . .
still cannot make up your mind , huh ? gotta go , royce .
jordan . you watch your ass .
sure . i will join the crowd .
and this class officer . . . wickwire . you think he was just trying to get even ? striking back for . . .
maybe . though it did not seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it . almost like . . . did i say he was class officer ?
almost like someone put him up to it . okay , who ?
no shortage of suspects .
the chief ? or maybe even turrentine ? your c . o . ?
it is done with , royce . let it go .
someone screwed you over like this , left unanswered charges hanging over your head , and you are not gonna fight back ?
i am tired of fighting back . i just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world , okay ?
well , before you crawl off to die , jordan , give me five minutes of good headwork .
what about him .
instructors typically pull three year assignments . this guy s in and out in one year your year . that sound right ?
sounds like an amazing coincidence .
or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the navy .
i do not know , i do not care .
well , pardon me if i do . now who else ? who could have leveraged a class officer like that ? c mon , jordan , keep your head in the game .
what ?
wickwire said he was dry docked in washington between stints at coronado . . .
you do not crap out of spec recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country . he is got a sea daddy somewhere .
i would sure like to know who .
yeah . me too .
look . it is not like you would be completely out of reach . and maybe we could call in a few favors , get you stationed at norfolk instead of coronado . there are ways of dealing with these things i mean , if people are so inclined .
which is guy speak for . . .
yes , jordan i will wait for you no matter how long .
well , now i feel so much better .
it was made clear before you came harassment equals career suicide . cannot say anything good , so they do not say much at all . to your face , anyway .
whose orders were those ?
it was made clear . anyway , stay ballsy . first week s hell , then it levels out . until s . e . r . e . training , anyway . that is hell and a half .
and how do you know that ?
made it to week last time .
i did not know they let you try again . especially at your age .
you are kind of a surprise yourself .
thanks , wick .
you know , i had an apartment about this size once .
wick . they got your crew , too ?
intagliata was out chasing breakfast . they found his tracks . well , shit .
when i was sitting behind a desk in washington , it made sense , somehow . blame it on my big brother . he was spec recon . and the stories he used to tell . . .
if you got a good one , wick . . .
they had to kill em ?
nah , they were dead ass asleep . but on every guard s chest , they left one marlboro cigarette . just a little calling card to say they would been there and could come back any time they wanted .
that is a good story .
so the shit you gotta go through ? to get from here to there ? brother said it was worth it . worth the training . . . worth the divorce . . . worth anything .
he was married ?
at first .
you got anybody , wick ?
not me . you ?
how would you make it last time , wick ? how would you get through this part ?
last time i did not .
let s keep talking , wick . just keep talking to me . . .
that is okay . just an ex girlfriend . and know i remember why .
first big night of liberty and no date ? you are pathetic , wickwire .
maybe i will just head over to mcp s with the others , have a drink or four . do not wanna come , do you ?
i cannot go out . not like this .
i think you look beautiful .
thanks for lying . but you are the class officer , wick , and it would just be weird if we hook up . besides . . .
sure , sure .
we are going over to her place to make salad and pasta . just , you know , nothing special .
okay . well . . . thought i would ask .
this is insane . you have got no proof .
just asking
what , you gonna give it all up for a maple twist ? how dumb you gotta be ? that is exactly what they
i do not know . . .
mighta been civilian .
i am looking , i am looking !
smoke it !
maybe half . not even .
grab an oar , find a way to weight it down , we are gonna need it . cortez , help him . flea ? you take one of the two full minis and just follow my lead .
you heard me . move on .
educate her , pyro .
it seems the men could not get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs . israeli men would linger over wounded females often to the detriment of the mission , often endangering their own lives . they do not use women anymore .
sir , someone mentioned you received the navy cross . may i ask what you got it for ?
for pulling a pound man out of a burning barrack in saudi arabia .
i see . so when a man tries to rescue another man , he is a hero . but when he tries to rescue a woman , he is gone soft .
could you have pulled that pound man clear , lieutenant ?
it also seems like a problem with the mengs attitude , sir . so maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead .
mccool s that same rank . we are both j . g . s .
you were commissioned one month earlier , which makes you the senior officer . remember . there are no bad crews only bad leaders .
dad .
any brothers ? sisters ?
dick , jane , and spot .
are you hungry ? that is your favorite food ? we will try to get it for you .
green eggs and ham . you are not going to get anywhere . you might as well put me in the cage .
you are in the cage , o neil . right here , right now .
should i be afraid ?
right down to your worthless womb , and i will tell you why . this is my island . my world . and here i can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world . take another scan of my little joy boy outside . if i can do that to a navy seal , that is gonna happen to you ? huh ?
was not deemed a threat .
she led us right to you . that is no threat ?
no . yes . i mean , depends on
the others already told me , o neil . they wanted to shoot , but you would not let them . because you went soft on another women
that is not right .
that is what your crew said . are they lying ? or are you ?
i think you are the liar .
i am not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage . you wear the bars , you made the call , and you got your whole crew
we did not know we were compromised . firing would only have given away our position .
you think we should go easy on women , o neil ?
no .
i am so glad we agree .
sure . just like your men do .
i think we oughtta practice it , just so you know what to expect .
good to see you again , too , sir .
okay , o neil . so you have impressed all the others . now try me .
chief , sir rescue team will not be here for minutes . that is your air situation ? over .
say again ? how many micks ?
, sir .
show us where you are , chief .
shut up , sir . i am concentrating .
your new roommate .
hey , hey , hey . no possibility . you cannot stay in here . you cannot sleep right next to me .
funny , the c . o . says i can .
that your desk ? i will take this one .
would you just get outta here ?
listen , sex ape . i am here to stay . and if you do not want me for a roommate or classmate , you got two options move out or ring out . end of file .
north ?
sure . now she wants to shoot .
move !
cortez , see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear . try a wrench on that thing .
flea ! keep your eyes on that spot ! mark it , mark it ! cortez ? what the hell you waiting for ?
shut your hole , slutnik .
darth vader reads poetry . . .
we are so fucked .
somebody throw a tent over this circus .
so am i .
that is our go to shit plan , o neil ?
this ai not even working wrong !
o neil , jordan .
thought you two were file closed .
you knew about us ?
sorry . thought you knew i knew .
the e ringers ? full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time when congress is already swinging the axe .
congress cuts , military bleeds . but pentagongs a big place . let s narrow the sights .
the navy ? they have made it clear they do not want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for womengs heads . that is it gonna cost to make a fleet of trident s co ed ?
sabotage born of economics ? would not be a first . but is hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure ?
possibly . just to spite dehaven .
hmm . let s aim higher .
the first female president ?
do not for a second think she did not leak this story . g . i . jane gives dehaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all .
women .
if you were the president , would not that put a little piss in your shoes ?
i do not know . seems . . .
this ai not about some little soldier girl slogging her way through commando school . the implications go way beyond .
christ , i do not want to see her take a fall . she thinks i do , but . . .
i take it this file is still open .
even tough i do not talk to her every day i still talk to her every day . know what i mean ?
okay , so now work it from the other end . think about california and how things might be handled there .
i do not . . . what , someone on base ? a mole ?
this is what you get for brain picking an old cia spook . but if i needed to control the outcome of this test case , that is how i would do it . a man in place . makes everything very controllable .
shut up . how can you eat like that ?
big bites .
hey , hey ! i am eating here !
audrey , you are too damned nice , that is your problem . nice gets you nothing in this town . you gotta be a killer to get ahead , you know what i am saying ? i am sorry , baby , but you just do not got what it takes .
great . see ya then .
what ? i just could not just let them sleep in the street .
where is audrey ?
in the bedroom . crying her eyes out because of you .
what ?
all that you gotta be vicious stuff you filled her head with .
me ! ? you where the one . . .
go in there . talk to her .
you know how i spent last weekend ? walking his damned dog .
nice guys finish last . first rule of the jungle .
well , i can be tough if i want .
no ! i just could not see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches . i wanted to have some adventure , some fun . . .
nearly four years . . .
sure i was . i thought lucy was gonna kill me .
we know , audrey .
it is all my fault . what have i done , animal ? what have i become ? look at me . this is not me . i do not do things like this .
you made a mistake .
did not you tell me he left for the airport ?
yeah . why are you asking ?
i just saw him . he is with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight .
perfect ! you wanted a story , well , baby , you got one .
look , you want to make it up to your friend ? well if he is right , this is your chance .
lucy would kill me if she knew .
it is the maintenance entrance . runs along the side of the tunnel . when they repaired it last year i worked on a piece about it .
yes . definitely . definitely enough .
only one way to find out .
oh yes he will .
you are crazy , go to the east side and take the park avenue to the jfk .
the jfk ? in the rain ! ?
but we can get to the west side faster .
no .
you must have quite some harem .
it is good to see you , nick .
what ?
yeah , well . . .
no , i am into earthworms now . you would not be interested . they are real boring creatures . very reliable , dependable , no surprises . . .
you are still mad at me , are not you ?
you just left me without a phone call , a letter , nothing . all this time . yeah , i guess i am still a little mad .
that was eight years ago . some people change , you know .
most people do not .
i am sorry you feel that way .
sure . i would like that .
when you and i use to attend rallies in college , we helped to create awareness . but from the inside now i can actually effect change . i never lost my idealism .
and exactly what changes are you trying to effect ?
i have this theory that we are inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we have done to nature .
and you think this creature is one of them ?
yes . the first of its kind . i found this blood sample earlier this evening . . .
blood sample ? how close did you get to that thing ?
i got pretty close .
what else do you know about it ?
are you sure ?
i do not get it . if it is the first of its kind , how can it be pregnant ?
nesting ?
yes . do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time !
well what the hell did you think was going to happen ?
you never said it was off the record .
i should not have to , audrey . you are supposed to be my friend . i trusted you .
i did not mean for it to turn out like this . look , i lied to you . i am not a reporter . when we broke up and i came out to new york i was so sure i would make it . but i have not . that is why i needed this story so bad . i just could not tell you i am a failure .
so you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes ?
i thought you said there would only be a dozen eggs .
i was wrong .
i know a way . i know how you can get a message out of here .
how do you know ?
our network covers the ranger games .
your station will not have any easier time contacting the military than i did .
oh my god ! they are coming !
somehow i never thought your life was this exciting .
you would be surprised .
really ? i would like to find out .
oh , just some insurance guy .
speak of the devil .
oh , please , your life does not suck . his life sucks .
he is scum ! as far as he is concerned you are just a pair of breasts that talk .
who is he ?
he was my college sweetie ! look at him . he looks so handsome on t . v . what the hell is he doing in panama .
nick tatopoulos .
that is the problem . he did .
remember my friend we saw on t . v . ?
your old sweetheart ?
yeah , well he just turned up in new jersey at the military command post . somehow all this is related to what happened down in panama . there s a story here . i know it . you got any tape or glue ?
i left my forgery kit back at the office .
audrey , i do not think this is a very good idea . caiman finds out and he will have your job .
i am tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity , luce . if there s a story here i am going to find it .
that is it to you ?
can i use some ?
what do i get ?
the warm feeling of helping your fellow man .
five bucks .
you are kidding , right ?
this is not the place . . .
just tell me , did you talk with him ?
he said he would consider it . it is between you and rodriguez .
are you serious ? he is going to consider me for he job ? what else did he say ?
and you are beautiful . . .
mr . caiman . . .
call me charlie .
mr . caiman , i have been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year . and i have never asked for anything but this job is really important to me . i am too old to be an assistant anymore . i need to know this job is going someplace .
so have dinner with me tonight .
i cannot .
it is your choice .
what ?
i have got something on this . i know a guy on the inside with the military . . .
not now . you got my bag ?
listen , this is the time when the big boys have to go to work , okay honey ?
we ? i do not think so .
i want that story , audrey . remember you work for me .
not anymore . mr . caiman , i quit .
ah , elsie chapman , paleontologist .
oh , i am not married .
really ? a girlfriend then ?
no . perhaps i work too much .
you mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart ?
well , i think you are cute .
oh , thank you . is she always like this ?
more than that . i believe this is a mutated aberration , a hybrid from the fall out in that region .
i do not think so .
me too .
i will try .
allez , allez !
that is when we will go in .
where is luc and pierre ?
they did not make it .
nick , my men and i will hold them here . you will have to go and get help !
christ . how many tunnels lead off the island ?
only five , sir . we have checked them all . he has not used any of them .
have them sealed off .
and how should we do that , sir ?
fill them with cement , brick them up , put land mines in them , bombs , i do not know , just make sure that goddamned thing does not leave the island !
they are with me !
you are fast .
that is our job .
well your people are getting in the way of my job .
major , what do you think could have done this ?
get your people out of there or i will .
it is tatopoulos .
right . the worm guy . can someone get those people off the beach ?
excuse me , would you mind telling me what the hell i am doing here ?
follow me .
we have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise .
we know .
yeah , you are the worm guy .
the radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm s dna ! you have any idea what that means ?
no , but i have the feeling i am about to find out .
it means that due to a man made accident the chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before . mutated by seventeen percent ?
they are enormous ! a new species created by mangs recklessness . that is what i have been trying to tell you , i am only a biologist . i take radioactive samples and study them .
then you are perfect . here s your radioactive sample . study it .
you are standing on it .
that is right .
but there s no animal in the world that can make prints like that ? is there ?
we are hoping you are going to help us figure that out .
it happened so fast no one knew what hit them til is was over .
do not tell me why it is not , tell me what the hell it is .
what do we know ? it was first sighted off the french polynesian pacific . an area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years .
what are you suggesting ?
when i needed to catch earthworms , i knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them . i had to draw them out .
you see , all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that do not rely on heat seeking . . .
um , excuse me , sir , but the situationgs more complicated than that . the blood i recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has .
so after we kill the creature we will begin a search for the nest .
it may be too late by then . these eggs will hatch very quickly .
no , it is still in my tent . it is . . . oh my god , she took it .
but you do not know for sure !
last time you did not even scratch it !
that is not true . our worm guy , er , i mean , dr . tatopoulos found blood .
we are sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body .
that thing s dead . what the hell are we waiting for ?
you do not have the authority to do that .
thanks .
we have met before .
oh yeah , the insurance guy .
sounds like a big company .
it is the french secret service .
oh .
we have learned that your american friends have decided not to look for the creature s nest .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
we know .
why are you telling this to me ?
i need you to trust me .
why do you need that ?
i need your trust if you are to help me find the nest .
oh , my bags . i have checked them in .
we , have already taken care of them .
this is america . there is nothing you can not buy .
i am not permitted to speak of such things .
sure .
it is my job to protect my country . sometimes i must even protect it from itself . from mistakes we have made . mistakes that we do not want the world to know about .
your talking about the nuclear testing in the pacific .
yes . this testing done by my country left a terrible mess . we are here to clean it up .
so you are in ?
are you kidding ? i always wanted to join the french foreign legion .
makes us look more american .
let s hope we are not the hors d oeuvres .
you were right .
good idea .
how do i do that ?
. tell them it is a code dragonfly . they should get you through .
i cannot get through . i do not know that is wrong .
it is okay . i know her .
it is raymond .
where are you ?
i just wanted to say , au revoir and thank you for your help , my friend .
wait . au revoir .
well good , that is very . . . nice .
by grabthar s hammer , dr . lazarus , i
do not do that . i am not kidding .
i am sorry , sir , i was only
just do not .
. . . yes sir . your quarters sir .
yes sir . marvelous , is not it ? completely distractionless .
where is my bed ?
is that the bathroom ?
yes sir . . . the use of your waste facilities were strangely absent from the historical records , so we had to extrapolate purely on the basis of your anatomy .
thanks .
good luck on your mission , sir . by grabthar s hammer , by the suns of warvan i wish you
uh uh ! what did we talk about ?
right . . . sorry , sir .
quellek . what are you doing in there ?
i avoided capture using the mak tar stealth haze . where is everyone ?
come with me . i will explain on the way .
open .
i am . . . i am shot .
i . . . i do not think i am going to make it sir . . .
no , do not talk like that , son . we are going to get you fixed up .
. . . it has been my greatest honor to serve with you . living by your example these years , my life has had meaning . i have been blessed . sir , i . . . i . . .
you will forgive my impertinence , sir , but even though we had never before met , always considered you as a father to me .
friend . you stole all my best lines . you cut me out of episode two entirely ! . .
i will not and nothing you say
the show must go on .
. . . damn you ! damn you !
. . . to camera center no matter whose shot you are blocking . . .
leadership . . . .
come in protector . . . protector . . .
just ! ?
like throwing gasoline on a fire . . .
we stop we die . keep holding the thruster down tommy !
you do not hold a thruster down ! it is for quick boosts
like you know ?
do not be insane , stop ! full stop !
keep going ! keep going !
that is the scale ? is that ten miles ? a hundred miles ?
this much .
must be some sort of mining facility .
you go first ! there s no time !
oh , of course , i forgot ! you have to be the hero , do not you ? . . . heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once ! oh no , jason nesmith could not possibly
nothing .
i heard something . a squeal .
kill it ? well i am open to ideas ! . . .
. . . . well you have to figure out what it wants . . . that is its motivation ?
it is a damn rock monster ! ! ! it does not have motivation !
that is your problem . you were never serious about the caraft . . . i am a rock . . . i just want to be a rock . . . still . peaceful . . tranquil . . . . . oh , but that is this ? something s making noise . . . no , not noise , no . . . movement . vibrations . make the vibrations stop , they go straight into me like a knife ! . . . i must crush the thing that makes the vibrations . . .
am i crazy , or do you actually have something there ?
shut up . just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity ,
i was staying in character . egomaniacal sonofabitch ?
sense memory . i see you got to win the fight . . .
i had the shot . . .
yes . good was done this . . . . .
okay . . . let s go , buddy , they can take it from here . . . i amo
no time to worry about that , alex . tommy , let s get this thing slowed down . . . gwen , see if you can calculate the impact point . guy , cet down to deck c and make sure tne injured are secured . also lets
oh , and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us ?
i played richard iii . . .
no . i cannot go out there ! i will not say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time . i will not . i cannot !
jason , what have you gotten us into ?
no , jason , that is a wrap ! there s nothing to think about !
they are drifting toward me . . . i think they are magnetic ! . . .
the engines are dead . we are drifting .
shut up .
you know , with the makeup and everything i actually thought he was smart for a second .
you think you could do better laredo ?
hey , watch that laredo shit .
. . . sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps . . .
you have a better plan , alex ?
as a matter of fact , i do . look at their eyes . they are obviously nocturnal . come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt . so our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode .
the guy is terminally selfish !
dear god . . . . how did i come to this ?
oh cannot i ? watch me !
why did not you stop at the market ?
i still have not got this bloody thing off .
you could order something in .
a boy comes to the door .
i do not know . . . it just was not like him .
yes , poor jason . as we speak he is probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers on . while here i sit eating christmas cheese in spring .
all this from watching the . . historical records ?
shit ! i am doing it ! i am repeating the damn computer !
the ships are gaining . . .
front armor is gone ! just slow it down a little !
alex ? where are you going ?
to see if there s a pub .
could they be the miners ?
nobody was watching ?
it does not make sense . . . surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures . . .
down there .
what ?
back there . you said the commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals .
no i did not .
yes you did .
by grabthar s hammer , this is true . nt . living room somewhere night
he probably . . . has some very important business to attend to . . .
no time for pleasantries , kyle . we have a level five emergency . the commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads .
oh . okay .
you have got the utility systems walkthrough , right ?
i have sectors . i think hector has the upper levels .
we would better get everybody online . and kyle , stop downloading porn . your frame rate is unacceptable .
excuse me guys .
it is a television show . okay ? that is all . it is just a bunch of fake sets , and wooden props , do you understand ?
yes but , we were wondering
there is no quantum flux and there is no auxiliary . . . there s no goddamn ship do you get it ?
we accidently traded vox units when we bumped into each other on saturday .
oh . . . oh , i see . oh .
that is your name , son ?
brandon .
brandon , i remember you from the convention , right ? . . . you had a lot of little technical observations about the ship , and i spoke sharply to you . . .
yes , i know , and i want you to know i thought about what you said . . . i know you meant it constructively but . . .
it is okay . listen
. . . but i want you to know that i am not a complete braincase , okay ? i understand completely that it is just a tv show . there is no ship , there is no beryllium sphere , no diagital conveyor . . . i mean , obviously it is all just a
it is real , brandon . all of it , it is real .
i knew it ! . . . i knew it ! . . .
brandon . . . the crew and i are in trouble and we need your help .
okay , you can go on in . . . i am going to get kyle . he knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive .
okay . . . okay , now what .
now make a right , you will see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility . the bowels of the ship .
we would never have the budget for this .
okay , so do you see a door marked core unit ? should be down at the far end to your left .
okay , that is where you want to be .
yes commander ?
what does the omega do ?
well , that is the big question , is not it ?
what do you mean ?
it is been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years . many believe that is a matter collapser , a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting seconds .
but you do not ?
no , i am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer , but a matter rearranger , converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past .
how did you come to that conclusion ?
my cousings boyfriend s sister went out with the screenwriter . his favorite movie is the omegaman . he is seen it times . . .
yes commander . . . all right , you are almost there . just go through the chompers and over the pit .
okay , now . but
wait two seconds then go .
lt . madison , go .
shit ! go !
go commander .
up .
what ? up ?
berithium lava coming through . use the handholds above you .
raise the glass and push the blue button .
that is it ?
yeah . that is wrong ? jason othino . i ust oncuont ot wou o oc oomooooateo onan onat .
we are getting major structural damage .
yes ?
that is the weather like outside ?
there is no weather in space .
i never get tired of that joke .
guys , we are sustaining structural damage ! . . .
the enemy is matching velocity .
the beryllium sphere has fractured under stress .
it is fractured . . .
we need another one .
no , we do not have an extra beryllium sphere .
all systems are working , commander .
all systems are working , commander . , cc pink c
that possibly . . . the valence bonds have shifted bi laterally ?
. . . what does that mean ?
what does that mean ? ! ! ! yes , i see ! yes . . . it means that perhaps . . . the . . . bonding molecules have become covalent ? ! . . .
covalent . . . right . so . . .
so our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate ! a two molecule compound sharing a free electron and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes !
ok !
i . . . well , uh . . . yes , absolutely .
never mind , fred . . . .
no , no . . . i will think on it . . .
right .
i will take my chances with gorignak .
listen fred . you did this for four years on the show . you can do it now . . . put your hands on the controls . .
you worked with hopkins ? i worship hopkins .
hopkins cannot drink your bathwater fred .
oh i make it up . use lots of k s and v s .
i do not like this . . . i do not like this at all . . .
of course . . . we will just zap him up with the digital conveyor !
listen , i will go in , create a distraction . have this . . . may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape .
it is suicide .
i am just a glorified extra , fred . i am a dead man anyway . if i am going to die , i would rather go out a hero than a coward .
maybe you are the plucky comic relief , you ever think of that ?
sure , guy , if you can stand the excitement .
you . . . know us ?
it is . . . incredible .
the lost footage . at the convention . the mysterious device in our last episo historical document .
do i ? do i ? for all you know i am just crewman ! okay , it is fleegman ! guy fleegman ! there ! now i am a whole person ! i cannot die ! fleegman ! they cannot kill me now , can they ? can they ?
something bad happened here .
of course they are cute now . but in a second they are going to turn mean and ugly somehow and then there are going to be a million more of them ! . . .
let s get out of here before one of those things kills guy .
we are doing episode , jason ?
all right . put me back on with him .
we should have a turbo . i am always saying activate turbo boosters , right ? . . .
oh , i am not ? i am not ? then that is my last name ?
your last name .
yeah , what is it ?
it is . . . i do not know .
no . nobody does . do you know why ? because my character is not important enough for a last name . because i am going to die five minutes in , why bother to come up with a last name for me ?
all right , let s all settle down . if we are going to get through this we are going to have to exercise self control .
let s just pick up the pace a little , shall we ?
jason , are we doing episode or not ?
it is a rough plan , guy ! what does it matter if we are doing episode or not ? !
because i died in episode !
a lathe ? ? ? get off the line , guy .
no . keep all energy to the armor .
hey . thanks for one nice intro . . . uh .
guy . . . you probably do not remember me do you ? i was on the show in . episode ? got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial ? crewman ?
hey , you want to drive ?
we are doing episode ?
whatever , the one with the hologram . the wall of fire .
where would they go ? back inside ?
not a clue . you ?
i think he just likes pointing at things .
we made it . commander , we made it . m alexander sort ov by grabtnar s h mmer , we ove to te ono tale .
we made it . commander , we made it .
how much of a nothing ? not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing ?
what do you want me to say , gwen ? . . . they wanted the commander .
you smiled at me .
you know it is one thing to treat us this way , but how can you do this to your fans ? . . .
one minute i am hey , i am dressing .
oh come on , it is not like i have not
only answers to me .
but i am the commander !
on the show i talk to the computer and repeat what it says . so that is what they built .
c mon , we are wanted up on the command deck .
tell them ? about . . .
who we are . do not you think they are going to be pissed ?
are you kidding ? i am not going to tell them .
well you have to tell them . what if something happens ? we are actors , not astronauts . . . we cannot do this stuff !
it is not the stuff . i mean , anybody can learn the stuff . . . the important thing is commitmnt . of anything is just committing to it .
ninty nine percent of acting is commitment . acting . stella adler never manned a resonance cannon , she taught acting . . .
we have no right to do this . they deserve to know .
gwen . . . gwen , c mon , wait , no !
let me think . i need time to think .
mathesar , maybe we should get some of your crew up here .
jason . .
we are going to fire everything we have got at him , all right ?
jason . . .
you just keep pushing those buttons , those there , send everything at him , okay ?
i thought it was the we are dead gesture ! i was agreeing ! like i know where the hold button is ? ? ?
listen , sarris , you cannot blame me for trying . . .
i do not think that is a cloud . . .
no , i do not think so . . . wait . they are not but . . . something is . oh my god .
computer , can it be repaired ?
computer , do we have a replacement beryllium sphere onboard ?
did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me ?
i could have held on to you ! . . .
do not be ridiculous .
why does this sound so familiar ?
it helps .
will you stop riding me ? !
yes . yes , i am here !
yeah . but i have got gorignak staring me in the face . i think i can take it though . . .
jason , we are going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there .
nothing . hold please .
turn on the translation circuit .
what the hell are you talking about ?
right .
uh . . . i hate to break it to you jason , but i do not know how to shut down a neutron reactor , and unless you took a learning annex course i do not know about , i am pretty sure you do not know how to shut down a neutron reactor either .
no i do not . but i know somebody who does .
wait . . . jason , here ! . . .
gwen . . .
we should not have to do this ! it makes no logical sense ! why is it here ?
because it was on the show !
well forget it ! i am not going . this episode was badly written !
mark .
tommy , degree turn to port !
this is great ! they are going to start eating each other out there .
tomorrow morning , before the store opening .
you are so full of shit
almost as much as he loves himself .
do not do it , tommy . he is not worth it .
i do not know guys . . . i mean , he almost looked . . . sincere . i know , it is bizarre !
i have one job on this lousy ship . it is stupid , but i am going to do it . got it ?
sure , no problem .
i cannot . . . it is on autopilot ! . . .
that thing s not going to get us down there fast enough . face it , he is dead .
wait , fred , what about your thing , you know . . . digitize me , sergeant chen !
is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now ?
closer ? i can try .
what are you doing ? what are thev doino ? c int . sarris ship h c
i see them ! i see them ! rd street pasadena
okey dokey , let s fire blue particle cannons full . fire red particle cannons full . fire gannet magnets left and right . fire pulse catapults from all chutes . and throw this thing at him too , killer .
better than my lieutenant . he failed to activate ship s neutron armor as quickly as i would hoped on our last encounter .
deliver the device now or i will destroy your ship .
listen , i would like to , but frankly . . i am not even sure where it is , or even . . .
you have ten seconds .
all right . you got it . you win . i will deliver it now . just give me a moment to set it up .
then tell me one thing . . . what does it do , the device ? the omega .
i do not know .
stop , please ! i do not know !
prepare a tear harness for the female . . .
no ! i swear i do not know ! please !
do you think i am a fool ? that the commander does not know every bolt , every weld of his ship ?
please , do not hurt them , it is not their fault . i am not the commander , i do not know anything .
gwen . the show . there s no choice . do it .
our dimwitted friends do not understand the concept of acting . they have no theater , no imagination these scientists .
we pretend . . .
simpler .
we . . we lie .
yes . . . you understand that , do not you , mathesar ? . . .
this is embarrassing , really . i sha not tell this story when i return home .
right , if this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent , but make sure i have a limo from my house , they jammed me into a toyota the last time i did one of these
i . . . certainly , but
catch me later , okay ?
oh , right ! the thing with the thing . come on in , i will get some pants on .
mind if we skip that ? i have to get back pretty quick for this thing in van nuys .
as you wish .
home .
you . . . you mean earth ?
yeah . earth . time to get back to earth , kids .
right . long live . . . that is your planet ?
theramin .
long live theramini . take a left here ?
but what if sarris survives ?
oh , i do not think so . i gave him both barrels .
he has a very powerful ship . perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of
i would but i am really running late and the s a parking lot after . but listen , the guy gives you any more trouble , just give a call . . .
thanks
it was a lot of fun . you kids are great .
it is perfectly safe . i promise .
. . . maintenance facility . . .
wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars , we will be there , this fine ship , this fine crew . never give up , never surrender !
no , thank god he has not .
then how did he find out about the device ?
our former commander was not . . . strong .
former commander ?
i am sorry . you deserve to be shown .
mathesar , i need you to prepare pods for my crew .
it is the tothian mine field left standing from the great war of .
you what ? . . what are you talking about ?
we have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations . the fault must lie with us , with the ship . . .
well . . . sort of . . .
we have become aware of these concepts only recently . in our dealings with sarris . often sarris will say one thing , and do another . promise us mercy and deliver destruction . . . it is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost . but if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with sarris .
but there it is ! . . .
a model , only as big as this .
but . . . inside , i have seen
sections of rooms made of plywood . our beryllium sphere was painted wire and plaster . the digital conveyor was christmas lights . . . decorations . it is all a fake . i am not him . . . i am a nothing . a nobody .
but . . . why ?
it is difficult to . . . on our planet we pretend in order to . . . entertain .
you can oc that ?
i did not say that . i said would not it be great if we could always , work together . that is what i said .
and determination .
wh . . . where are we ?
twenty third quadrant of gamma sector . i can show you on a map .
i think we are going to exit the space port .
they designed the ship from watching you . so . . . take her out , lieutenant . . .
why do not you just turn it on and see ?
just go ! go ! dammit punch go !
it is as far as it goes !
push it . hold it down .
oh god . . .
what kind of signal ?
anything .
okay , i will do this . . . caw caw !
tommy , we have these . . .
okay , let s go .
good work , tommy . let s go !
how about the pig lizard ?
hey i was doing okay with the pig lizard .
it does not have eyes .
the throat , the mouth . . . its vulnerable spots .
it is a rock . it does not have vulnerable spots !
we have got to get out of here . c mon , hurry
jason ? what about me ? what do i do ?
practice driving , tommy .
pedal to the metal . . .
commander ? . . . call me laredo ?
mark into the black hole , areao .
i am trying commander . . . everything s a blur , but as long as i stay locked to that vox signal . . .
patience , lt . . patience .
the core could be hardwired to overload without much effort .
but sir , my men . the core implosion is not reversible . . .
find them .
get oack on their tail .
because they are coming right at us .
fire at will . hi d nt . protector
they always say that .
hmmm . . . she is beneath me , i am afraid .
i wish she was beneath me .
what does she see in them ?
congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods probably their whores !
patience , colonel arnold . active personalities terrify these men . but , congratulations on your victory at ticonderoga . . .
you would have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness .
over three hundred miles .
you seem pleased by the prospect .
exceedingly . besides , if i had half the wagons that were used to lug the rum to philadelphia for this congress , i could move a whole army to the moon !
well , you fought with them against the french and iroquois , how good were they then ?
they died well . otherwise , they did not do much right . but if we have war , the british will surely send their best troops right now they have no other enemies .
and a french alliance ?
ben franklings going to paris , but i think the french will be long on talk and short on guns . our troops are mobs , they will not take orders , have no equipment . . . could they beat the british ?
it comes down to leaders . if our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe if they go into the forests with the troops , eat what they eat , fight with them , perhaps to die ? the most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation .
i have come to report that we have had a bit of luck !
congress has picked up it is skirts and is racing for baltimore . they are not waiting for spring ! of course , they still had time to deny my promotion . even john adams voted against it . . .
why in hell would john do that ? why in hell would any of them do that ? after all you have done , it is unbelievable !
oh , they have reasons . . . there s a lot of confusion these days .
they do not trust me , that is the truth is not it ? sam adams never did .
but trust you to do what ? one side in congress wants compromise another glorious battle some surrender some , of course , just want power and money . but if you do not mind my asking , george , what are your plans ?
the mangs waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief .
congress is talking openly about replacing you with lee .
is that a fact .
it is .
do not do anything rash , please , benedict .
the army can survive without me .
then , i need you . we all do . without your victory the men would have no hope at all .
someday , george , you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what congress thinks that is . it may come down to us , or them someday . you or them . cicero was right was is a time when the laws are silent .
i hope i never have to believe that .
christ , george , joseph reed s been writing letters back to congress attacking you . your own aide !
we are so damned important ! look at us nathanael , you were a horse shoer , benedict , before this ?
well , truth be told ? i was a pharmacist . alexander ?
i ? you all know my history .
while they are strung out ?
exactly . we would attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard . it would cause the line to buckle . then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half .
same old story .
that cannot be .
there s this whispering campaign against me ever since gates won at saratoga .
gates ? he used my battle plan and i humbly submit that without me he would still be back at saratoga waiting for the british to attack . george , why have not you moved into the potts house back at the creek ? much more befitting of a commander and chief than your field tent . and . . . you could entertain . i think you need to entertain more . seriously ! get a few new jersey whores up here , invite some congressmen . . . could not hurt .
as soon as the men have good shelters i will move . perhaps martha will join me this winter .
there , then , you can have sort of a normal life .
i am sure his dogs will be overjoyed .
the point being he is also a candidate for my job . if we can pull this off , maybe i can restore their faith in me .
could not you have appealed to congress ?
you go too far , benedict .
cut those men down . congress is pushing ahead with your court martial . benedict , trust me to handle this .
tell mrs . washington i am compelled to stay a while longer .
you are never , never to touch my guns ! do you understand ! ?
yes , general . but if you have to shoot somebody , you cannot .
none of the servants is to touch a gun ! you know that !
well . . . i misunderstood , then .
a lot of years have gone by .
what ? what are you talking about ?
that you would have known you can trust me .
yes , william . i am apologizing .
yes , general ?
you have served me loyally , year after year , without complaining . i have thought hard about you this past winter . i want to free you , wil . i want to give you your freedom , after this battle is fought .
yes , general .
wil , i am giving you your freedom . do you understand ?
no . i guess .
you would have money every year , so you would not have to work . you can stay at mount vernon as long as you want . . .
i ai not forgot about the freedom .
well , general , i think i ai not got no school learning , i ai not got no trade . . . and i am a drunk . so , i think there ai not much left to be set free .
no , my lord .
what sort of boots would you say he is wearing ? i should say , no sort of boots at all . are not those rags wrapped around his feet ? is that what he marched here in ?
yes , my lord .
and , is that a pitchfork beside him ?
many of them , many did not possess proper arms . my lord .
because they have hardly any uniforms , they designate officers with colored ribbons . my lord .
by red , what rank would you say this black , officer , soldier is , colonel ?
i , do not know what color is what officer , my lord . . .
more than that , sir . . . my orders from congress .
lafayette will not be happy . . .
the british ! these men cannot stand against them !
what do you know about these men ! ? they can stand against anything ! they have seen more war than most field generals ! they are not cowards , sir ! they are not afraid !
that is greene . he is supporting our reconsolidation .
marquis ! get these men reformed , send steuben and wayne out on the left . . .
hamilton , you are going to have to cover our asses as we cross .
we have got powder but no ball !
then use rocks !
i will be twenty next year , sir .
i will expect you for dinner this evening , captain hamilton . for christ s sake , have a bath .
delighted , sir .
no one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than i . but if victory is remote and there s any hope for a negotiated peace , we must keep this army intact .
therefore , retreat .
well , sir , then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear .
and is that the most horrible thing in the world ?
with pleasure . . . and an honor . did you hear about nathan hale ?
that young school teacher . . . i heard the british hung him as a spy .
but it is what he said , just before they killed him i regret that i have but one life to give to my country .
it is a wonder they find the british cause worth dying for .
to learn to shoot cannon ?
we better , congress invented him .
they go back home to keep their families alive , stay into the spring to plant . then , they start coming back to us .
get the body of our army up to greene s vanguard as fast as we can . all the damned fool has to do is hit the british rearguard and then hold for us .
colonel hamilton . anyone who served under arnold , i want them shipped north . i do not want any troops here who served under arnold .
did you know that arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair ? most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked ! ? you realize what would happen if this fort fell ? the whole hudson would be open to them !
do not lie to me , hamilton ! if i had not court martialed arnold . . .
sir , arnold is a traitor .
i must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect !
i am not conscious of it , sir ! but since you have thought it necessary to tell me so , we part !
congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions .
no one knows . . .
to hell with arnold . . .
he warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people even if it was against congress . george , the time has come for you to declare yourself king of america . listen to me , the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne ! george , you must declare yourself with us or against us .
is this a coup ? alexander , are you trying to tell me that i might be assassinated if i do not agree ?
march on philadelphia ! get joseph reed , and the pigs in congress , the speculators , who have grown fat off the war ! get them all ! sweep them aside !
yes , i believe so .
well , if it is my last order , then i order them to be there ! tell them i will give them my decision then .
i am not sure .
george , you are the only man the people trust . . . trust with power . they know you will not betray them .
but it is more than just that , am i right ?
you are asking me to be president of a republic , not king ? not a dictator over subjects ?
good day , mister adams . . . george , that is the word from boston ?
the last i heard , a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on breed s hill . with one stroke the british could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it .
who s in command out there ?
who the hell knows ? everyone s giving orders . it is all very democratic .
george , we have got to get you out there before we lose our whole army .
yes , an astonishing power over weak minds .
as does your ability , horatio . we must talk further , when it is more convenient .
i do not know delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things . and , if he is popular with his men . . .
i think many would like to see him commander in chief .
lafayette is a child !
lafayette is my friend ! he believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind so , of course he is a child . but he would have died before he would have let me down .
of course the army will acquit him , that is not the point . . . arnold is a man and will understand . what i need to understand is , john , sam . . . what is happening here ? who are those people in there ? the fat ones in silk ?
they are . . . friends of congress .
is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went ?
he is from virginia there is no more classist , elitist . . . english place on earth than virginia . and , what in hell has he done for our cause ? washington has been preaching compromise , compromise , compromise ! hancock acts , he led the boston tea party ! that is why new england loves him .
hancock led the boston tea party because he is a goddamned tea smuggler ! he was not protesting inequality , he was eliminating competition . now , you listen to me we need to get a southerner elected commander in chief , or the south will not fight ! what have we been struggling for all these years ? for this moment ! and , if we fail now , remember you stopped us !
i tell you every damned place i go the man is adored ! general washington ! champion of trenton ! savior of the republic ! and you should hear the way people are deprecating congress !
makes you gag .
gag on your own invention , then .
oh , come now . . .
you invented this , this . . .
he has the soul of an aristocrat who would like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people !
finally ! ? it is people like these who , as soon as they get a little power , want more and more . more ale , here !
again , just to touch on a touchy subject , but . . . would the people accept another leader over washington ?
it is the political cost of doing business , george .
if he is not , then he is stupid .
these men have suffered but i believe they will fight .
i hear general lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in new york why will not he come on ! ?
general lee is detained captain . . .
detained by what ?
the british army , sir !
the british army is right back there , across that river ! sir ! i think it must be something else that detains general lee .
we already have black soldiers in our army . . .
unofficially , general greene .
that is the difference ?
spies from quebec confirm that the british are sending an entire fleet down lake champlain . . .
a fleet ?
what can he do ? the british have massive superiority .
i understand , george .
george ! so good to be back !
joseph , the british spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges . in my opinion he saved my army .
well , george , congress just passed a resolution censuring arnold for destruction of government property . i would not cast my fate with that man .
a ground swell christian movement , george , you see ?
no . as a matter of fact i have not the slightest idea what you are talking about .
to assert the rights of our founding fathers ! this country was colonized by christians ! this shall become a christian revolution . surely as a good christian you understand that !
i mean , i am a deist . a belief i share with the likes of tom jefferson and ben franklin . surely you knew that .
no , i did not . really ? well , what the hell is a deist , precisely ?
they are also very religious . so , we will attack them three days from now , on christmas . one force under me , and another to the south under colonel cadwalader . . .
george , i am afraid if you go through with this madness i must tender my resignation as your aide . i see where we are headed , you are putting your trust in the likes of hamilton and arnold . . .
how many generals do we have like arnold ? he is got guts he is vain , and he fights !
and , hamilton ? greene ?
they help me understand why we fight .
understand ? you need to be listening to people like john adams , and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind !
joseph , are you afraid to cross that river with me ? i accept your resignation . with regret . you have leave to return to philadelphia . . .
the man is a traitor !
how can you say that ?
well , i shall deny him to you ! he is evil on earth !
are you all going insane ! ? benedict arnold ! the man who stopped the british on lake champlain ! who carried the day at saratoga ! goddamn it , joseph , you own two mansions , ride in an expensive , tory coach ! you are all nothing but a pack of greedy pigs !
we have more officers created by congress than we know what to do with .
but , general , i assure you my motives are sincere .
what i want to know is sir where is your daddy ?
uh . . . none just now , but . . .
i . . . they look both the same .
the one with philadelphia spelled correctly is the counterfeit .
mon general , i have come here to learn and to give , not to take . i am serving without salary .
you must be very rich .
i am . then , i understand you too serve without salary . you know , since your charming little victories at trenton and princeton , the french court is softening . i expect any time now a ship load of supplies . . .
charming little victories ? please do not expect much more of us , monsieur .
i only meant . . .
these supplies . . . ?
muskets and uniforms and bayonets .
and how rusty are these muskets ?
sir , these are our finest firearms from the armory at charleville ! they are a gift from the people of france !
i rode here , on my horse .
chose another . any general worth anything should have a brace of horses .
yes , i will write him and tell his ministers and the court .
when the snow melts , mon petite marquis , i suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red british soldiers .
my baby daughter has died . . . my baby . . . mon petite henriette . . .
general lee , sir !
get these men back in line !
i will continue with our french allies , concentrating on new york .
my god , these people mean to go to war ! they really mean it .
surely you knew this was coming .
war ? no ! i did not ! when you said compromise was possible i believed it was probable . there s no middle ground at all ? we are the king s children !
but to go to war over trade , over money ? surely there s still time for a compromise .
of course , if it were that simple . these people ? they are after something else . . .
my god , what ?
the eternal dream of the disenfranchised , my dear a classless world . not a very real expectation .
i am very aware of that .
i can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated , to be destroyed . . .
do not be ridiculous , of course that will not happen .
have you been reading what minister jefferson has to say ? if he had his way , all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome . and that would destroy us as surely as a british victory .
and , what prize do you see ? what could we possible gain ?
everything . if we force britain into concessions it will open up the western lands and that would be a boon for our family . we already have more slaves than we need , but we need more land .
you are no fool , george . you never have been .
when you lived with the fairfaxes ?
when i was a young man we used to recite cato . . . we would come together recite it like they were words from heaven . devotion to country , duty , purity of heart . . . purity of heart . i was drunk on something then . . .
that is when sally fairfax was tutoring you . . .
and have you heard anything from our dear friend , sally ? what with all the rumors getting back to england . i thought she might inquire after us . but then i believe she always looked down on us .
i think i heard that .
it is an anti christian dogma ! i cannot believe you are so calm about it !
what else ? from virginia ?
well , i would not want to trouble you with this now .
virginia is outraged with your order allowing negroes to fight in the army . there s a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal . they wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests .
to win this war i need an army .
oh , indeed ? you know very well people are frightened of arming the negroes ! they beg you to consider the future . what good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish ! ?
that is the point of a revolution if it does not ?
some things must never change .
is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men ? it is damned condescending !
do not condescend to me ! we have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind . . .
our kind ? what is that supposed to mean ? these men are all i have left and they stay because they will fight ! they desire it ! they seek it ! of course virginia is terrified ! for my soldiers this is a war to obliterate the upper class from the face of the earth ! should i tell them all to go home because if they win it will ruin me ! ? it is impossible for me to imagine that negroes are fighting so that only white men may be free ! if we win this war they will own this country too !
martha ! for god s sake !
leave me , now sir , i am tired .
come out and meet my soldiers . they are good people .
i want you to see our hospital .
i do not want to see your hospital .
we are leaving them ?
they are finished , they cannot help us anymore ! they have done their duty , general greene , now you do yours !
yessir !
yes , yes , happy to meet you .
i . . . i am possessed of the idea of a command in your army , sir .
it is not my army yet , colonel greene . looks like you have seen some action did you hurt your leg , in a fight ?
i was born with a limp , sir . the militia used to hate it when i marches with them because my pike would always sway . . .
i have commanded the rhode island militia for a year now . my father is an ironmaster . as was i .
yes , but i have spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history . and i read the lives of caesar , alexander , hannibal . . . sir , i am volunteering you the wholehearted support of the rhode island army .
sir , congress has not issued their pay for two months , many have not eaten properly for at least that long . you are being a little hard on them , do not you think ?
nathanael , someone bred to station , bred to being a gentleman unlike these men his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs .
well sir , i was an ironmaster before you got me . maybe i will let you down yet .
you wrong me , general i am an officer and a horse shoer .
i am with captain hamilton .
yes , i thought that is how you would feel , nathanael .
you have a free tongue , captain hamilton .
you do not believe i can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism ?
no . we are all of us after something . it is easy for me to fight for the common man . my father could only dream that i would be . . . a general someday ? and what of my daughter or son ? i know what i am after . but now , with all this talk about compromise ? it means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope .
i will not betray you , nathanael .
but you are an aristocrat and a slave owner . sir .
then , maybe i do see what you are after perhaps . . . you get to chose again . . .
you have got to stop them here or our whole line will cave in ! it is all right boys , i am here !
i am honored , but , reluctant to leave you .
they are for my bodyguard . i have an absolute conviction that arnold is planning to have me assassinated ! it will be harder if i am surrounded by a body of men who look like me , do not you think ?
yes sir , it is a wise idea . . .
it is we need you george .
you know , i came back to mount vernon to retire . i do not need to be in government .
you know very well who it is that i love .
is that the truth ? well , we cannot carry on like animals any longer .
but not more than your comfort .
and what is this , then ? been off to fight the french because you are a patriot ? or is this you , gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war ! ?
that is a lie !
is it ? william says now you have requested a british commission , why not colonial ? i will clear it up for you , sir , because as a british officer you can lord over colonial yokels more than that , it will even get you into polite society ! your dream come true , george , the only dream that really matters to you .
perhaps you have been counting my acres , mrs . fairfax , and discovered exactly how poor i really am .
now that is a lie ! see how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet ! when you break off your engagement to martha curtis , i will divorce william ! do you hear ? you get what you want from this world , then throw it all away on love !
i would throw everything away for you .
i remember a pair of young philosophers once , who laughed at the world .
well , i remember a philosopher who said something that i used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements . . . but which i now see means us all .
really ? which precious homily was it ?
mankind is born free , but everywhere he is in chains . . .
george , i am sorry .
oh , but you must not mind my talking about you ! in fact , william says my main job here at belvoir is to civilize you to make an honest english gentleman out of you .
that is not what i said ! now , sally , you are embarrassing me ! watch out for her , george she talks refinement , but she has a barbarous soul !
except for that , quite like home england , that is .
hear that , george ? sally s actually taken to thinking of this clod of earth as her home . and it is her first tour . we are gratified , are not we george ?
words , words , words ! sally has been tutoring george in the philosophies , is not that right ?
africa , of course .
africa ? that is so far ? how do they get here ?
slavers capture them and bring them here .
capture them ? well , i have never seen anything like it , so . . . of course i am curious .
sally , our slave system is a british law . . .
or , civilized .
in the minuet , george , every movement is significant , like the strut of cranes . . .
that is just my interpretation . actually it is a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners . you see ? walk in a gently z . there are four distinct movements . . .
it is stupid , of course .
perhaps you best ask , why you wish it . you asked william to teach you manners , philosophy , decorum . . . as i said , it is completely stupid .
the place to want to be is america . every english child dreams of it . i dreamt it .
i think america suits you .
it is the freest land on earth .
is it ? well , i am scared of what we have become in our freedom .
well , we must be who we must be . . .
what else should i become ? there s no difference between virginia and england . i must be educated if i am to take my place in society . my father could not afford to send me to england for school he made a shambles of our fortunes . everyone laughs at me .
i think i will disappoint you .
let s get you darker !
you are out of your mind !
why ? juba was an african and you want to look the part hold still .
they can use their imaginations .
those people ? i doubt they would think of this . ooo , you are wonderful this color !
i am lost in ecstasy ! and dost thou love , thou charming maid ?
and dost thou live to ask it ?
that is good . . . who ?
voltaire , of course . . .
that land belongs to the strongest .
just because they are born ?
yes !
who says so ?
i say !
i see . . .
and others , say . . . have you even read locke , vattel , voltaire , diderot . . .
are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war ? you know why i do not trust revolutions ? because each of us is who we are we make speeches , print pamphlets , and we never change . the world is not a philosophical abstraction , mister adams , it is us . and , i do not believe you can ever change human nature .
that ? i hear a mob unemployed , drunkards , vagabonds . . . the world s dregs .
well , i hear the people . indentured servants , freed slaves . . . escaped slaves . the world s castaways . and , my fear is , in the scramble for power that is coming , you will betray them .
god damn you , sam adams ! you wanted a revolutionary army and now that we have really got one it scares you more than it does the british !
though , sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season .
this , this is life indeed ! life worth preserving , such life as juba never felt till now .
juba was a numidian .
he was not black ! he was . . . tan ! weathered !
do not be silly , you have whole worlds to fathom .
an oldsmobile silhouette .
i reserved a cadillac .
yeah , well , this one s the cadillac of minivans .
you are kidding me , right ?
hey , you want la tierra rent a car just over there , but i think all they got are rabbit convertibles .
you did not have to shoot him , bo . we coulda just beat him up some .
you see that ? the way the man just went right over ?
yeah , well , i am bored , bear . i wanna make movies .
mr . lovejoy ? that is cute , bo .
does not matter what it is called , harry s got martin weir and it is gonna be big .
they all sound big at the talking stage .
so where is the money ?
i guess still in the locker .
you guess ? you mean you do not know ?
i mean i do not care .
i seen it , but i do not believe it . says harry shot ronnie five times . four to the chest and one through his foot .
his foot . jeez , poor ronnie . . .
yeah , i am really gonna miss him .
i cannot . i got to take farrah to satangs place down in costa mesa .
who ?
her mother . not that it matters because i do not work for you no more . i quit . i just wanted to come by , tell you to your face so there s no misunderstanding .
whoa . . . this is the man used to jump offa high buildings ?
into air bags . there s no cushion under what you are doing . i am out of it , cat . i am done .
bear . the colombians are in l . a . seems they all upset about their money . that ai not enough , as a bonus , it turns out the yoyo was escobar s nephew .
that is your problem . you should not have smoked the guy .
come here , farrah . . .
farrah . come here .
remember harry s story about the dry cleaner palmer was after ? guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline ?
what about him ?
i was thinking tonight you could go have a look around palmer s hotel room while i go check out karen flores place . see if he has not stashed it somewhere .
and if we do not happen to find it under palmer s mattress or inside karen flores undie drawer ? what then ?
just do what i told you and meet me back here at midnight .
no . that is this ?
plan b . here ya go , honey . . .
the money . fuck . i gotta think . . .
calm down , bear . . .
calm down ? we are going away for life and you tell me to calm down ?
do not fade on me now , bear . not unless you wanna hold farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons .
hey , he should have a weapon , a knife or something .
we will get it later .
you are right .
so you did not have the key with you .
you think i would be standing here ? you set somebody up and you want it to work , it has to be a surprise . can you remember that ?
you spotted them , huh ?
i have to ask you for that key .
what , the setup did not work so you want the key back ?
catlett says if you do not open the locker the deal s off .
you serious ? this is how you guys do business ? i cannot believe you are not dead .
i do not need a gun . where is it ? if it is not on you , it is around here someplace .
not too bad .
how about when you went down the stairs ?
so . . . how many movies you been in ?
about sixty .
no shit ? what are some of em ?
your who ?
yayo . where is he ?
sure . family . i know how that goes .
he comes up here with our product . he suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars . he never shows up . meanwhile , my sister s going crazy calling me all the time worried about him . me , i just wanna know what happened to my focking money .
well , i do not know . i gave the man his money , sent him on his way .
you gave him the money ?
i gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it .
now why would you do that ? put the money in a locker ?
because there were a zillion dea guys hanging around the terminal .
a zillion , huh ? that is a lot .
where is your partner , the jumpy one ? why is not he here ?
he is around someplace .
i hear he is around palm springs . dealing our product . product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars . why do you keep talking to me bullshit ? i think maybe i have ramon and ceasar staple your tongue to your chin . what do you think ?
i went to uc san diego . we are gonna spend the weekend at the universal sheraton . we are gonna take the tour . see the shark . check out the miami vice action spectacular . after , we will come here , get our money .
harry , let me answer that .
you can talk to me .
that is what i thought . so let me put it this way . . .
that is funny , i was just wondering what i was gonna break of yours to get it away from you .
i would never make you as a burglar , not in that outfit .
it is what he said , i am his associate .
you must bring something heavy to the deal .
that is right , me .
yeah , we are getting martin .
no shit , come on . how you gonna do that ?
i put a gun right here . . . . . . and i tell him , sign the paper marty or your fucking dead . like that .
i wonder , would that work ? you know who i see for al roxy ? harvey keitel . the man could do it in his sleep .
harvey keitel . yeah . maybe . he was pretty good in the movie fingers .
i missed that one . or , hey , you know who else ? morgan freeman . you know morgan ?
yeah , morgan freeman . but he is a colored guy .
so what ? where is it say in this script he is white ? color is what the part needs , man , somebody to do it has some style . the way it is now , ronnie could do it , play himself , some cracked out asshole . so whatta you think of the script ?
i am with you on that . and do not you think it needs a good female part ? increase the romance angle .
what about her ?
get something going there .
with ilona ? you know how old ilona is ?
she is . . . young .
young ? she is fucking nine years old , same age as lovejoy s kid . bernie . one she calls bernard . have you read the script ?
yeah , i read it . i was just thinking you could make her older . we might even be able to get karen flores .
who ?
she is been out of movies a few years , but she is good . real good .
there s nothing to know . you have an idea , you write down what you wanna say . then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong , if you are not positive yourself . maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words . . . although i have seen scripts where i know words were not spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all . so i do not think it is too important . anyway , you come to the last page you write in fade out and that is the end , you are done .
that is all there is to it , huh ?
that is all .
yeah , well , we need a ride somewhere , we will let you know .
what money ?
the three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named leo .
lemme see if i got this right , you break into karen flores house , ask me for three hundred grand , does not even belong to you ?
tell you what . . .
what , you gonna shoot me now , bo ?
in just a second . two . . .
i do not believe this .
three .
she cannot talk right now .
alright , bo . you can have the money . . . but it is not here . i have to go get it .
okay . fine . the meantime , i will just hang on to her for safe keeping .
i will find it .
i am at wonderland avenue . it is right off laurel .
gimme an hour .
in the can . that the money ?
first you and me gotta get a couple things straight .
what ?
it was rio bravo . robert mitchum was the drunk in el dorado , dean martin in rio bravo , practically the same part . john wayne , he also did the same thing in both . he played john wayne .
man , i cannot wait for you to be dead .
bear , you are not really gonna
i cannot do it .
you positive about that ?
it is a different kind of deal .
you must be making some big deals , doing lunch in a place like this ?
i am working on a few things .
yeah , i hear you bagged martin weir for mr . lovejoy .
boy , this town . word gets around , does not it ?
chili palmer showed you my script ?
yeah , i was wondering why he should do that .
you serious ?
all i want in return is to work on the movie with you . fact i already got some ideas on how to fix it up .
you are gonna just give me five hundred grand ?
we will talk about that , harry . but first i gotta know , how would you hook up with chili palmer .
leo , i do not know .
whenever you want it . the money s in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags , you know ? in a locker at the airport , waiting to be picked up .
the airport .
it was waiting out there on another deal , one that did not go through one you do not want to know about .
it is not the kind of thing you do .
that is the magic number .
what i been wondering is where is he been .
yeah , where have you been ? we have not heard from you lately .
by friday , man , or you are fucking dead as disco .
i am already in town , but it do not matter . we got dick in the bank . we dumped it all in harry s movie .
what i am saying is the man wants his money and he wants it now .
who is this ?
are you the guy they called ray bones ?
depends . who s this ?
who is this ? i am the one telling you the way it is , okay , asshole ? that is who i am . now you want your three hundred grand or do not you ?
what three hundred grand ?
the three hundred grand a guy named leo devoe scammed off an airline . the three hundred grand chili palmer now has in his possession .
yeah , i am here . i just do not like the anonymous crap . it means your either chickenshit or not for real .
yeah ? well , trust me . i am very for real .
okay . so who are you ?
i work for harry zimm , alright ?
who ?
harry zimm . the man happens to be a major hollywood player .
never heard of him .
maybe that is because you have never been out have fucking miami , dipshit . maybe it is time you got on a plane , flew out to l . a . and took a meeting with mr . zimm .
hey , zimm does not ask for dick . zimm tells you the way it is . . . or else .
or else what ?
or else use your fucking imagination .
ray . look at me .
look at me , ray .
you say look at you ?
that is correct . look at me .
i told them i was you . i acted stupid and they believed me .
so what brings you to l . a . , bones ?
do not insult me . get up and turn around .
cause the guy s a customer now , stupid . his ass belongs to me .
yeah ? which terminal ?
sovereign .
you found leo , did not you ? took the poor asshole s money and put it in a locker , ready to go . why have not you left ?
i like it here .
whatever you want , ray .
ray barboni . from miami .
what , like that is supposed to mean something to me ?
he owes me money .
get in line , bro .
i do not like waiting .
tough shit , bro . this ai not miami . you want something , talk to me .
hey , fuckball , i do not need your permission . l . a . s an open city .
whatta you got there . . . some kinda pop nine , the fucking fiat of guns , always jamming at the wrong time .
that is right .
what are you doing in los angeles ?
i am in the movie business .
you are an investor , is that it ?
i am a producer .
you have a card in here ?
not yet . i just started .
i am . i am a fan of everything that is l . a . i love it out here .
it was c . . . i do not know , sixteen or seventeen , one of those . why ? you looking for anyway , a bomb or something ?
something should not be there .
why do not you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look . maybe you will find it .
that is the idea . i will think about it .
that is what i would do . make sure i got the right guy next time .
get him out have here .
leo spanked a waitress ?
apparently , way it went , he invited her to come to santa anita to play the ponies with him . she told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush . my guess , he is by his lonesome at the track right now .
what have you got ?
guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand , sixty days over a movie producer .
movie producer ? yeah , why not .
where you been , harry ?
we just did . i told you my name s chili palmer .
you look okay to me , harry . come over here and sit down . tell me what you been up to .
i want you to keep looking right here , okay ?
that is what i am doing .
you know dick allen , mesa s casino ?
dick allengs a very dear friend of mine . how far you want to go with this ?
we are there , harry . you signed markers for a hundred and a half , you are over sixty days past due and you have not told anybody what the problem is .
harry , lemme give you some advice .
i know what a marker is .
they do not want to deposit yours and have it bounce . that annoys them . so your dear friend dick allengs been calling , leaving messages on your machine , but you never get back to him . i happen to be in vegas on another matter , and dick asks me as a favor would i look you up . i follow you over here , see you in the window with this woman , looks a lot like that actress karen flores , was in grotesque , except she is not blond anymore . . .
why do i have to keep looking at you ?
i want you to .
you gonna get rough now , threaten me ? i make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken ?
come on , harry mesas ? the worst they might do is get a judgment against you , uttering a bad check . i cannot imagine you want that to happen , man in your position .
fucking basketball game .
i produce feature motion pictures , no tv . you mentioned grotesque , that happened to be grotesque part ii that karen flores was in . she starred in all three of my slime creatures releases you might have seen .
karen , it is a pleasure . how you doing ?
you just did .
i mean , the way you told it to me . start at the beginning , we see how the story line develops .
or the guy thinks he could get em broken . you have to understand the loan shark s in business the same as anybody else . he is not in it to hurt people . he is in it to make money .
that is right . as a matter of fact . . .
well , since leo s name was on the passenger list . . .
i do not know about his wanting to meet celebrities , that is something new . but , yeah , he comes to l . a . then after that , i do not know what happens .
i said i had an idea , that is all .
that is half a movie , with holes in it . maybe forty minutes of screen time . you do not even have a girl , a female lead , and on top of that , there s no one to sympathize with , you do not have a good guy .
the shylock s the good guy .
the shylock ? he is barely mentioned . and it is not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast .
wait a minute , you are not the guy , are you ? the dry cleaner ?
you mean , leo ?
you would not be talking to me if you were .
i am not the guy , harry .
but you work for the casino ?
i am out here looking for leo . i just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend , dick allen .
so you do not work for the casino ?
what i did till recently . after i get done here i will think about what i am gonna do next .
they always paid .
not really .
what does that mean ?
maybe a few times i have .
ever shot anybody .
once .
really ? you ever been arrested ?
i have been picked up a couple times . loan sharking . racketeering . but i was never convicted . i am clean .
racketeering , that covers a lot of ground , does not it ?
harry , look at me .
because they are not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint . the first thing they would do is break my legs .
you got that on the brain , harry . if you are so scared of em why would you take their money to vegas to begin with ?
because i need half a million to buy a script .
for a movie ?
a blockbuster . but quality . no mutants or maniacs . this one s gonna be my driving miss daisy .
that is it called ?
mr . lovejoy .
mr . lovejoy ? that is the title ?
it is not bad when you know what it is about .
who s the star ?
martin weir . he played the mob guy that turned snitch in the cyclone .
one of his best parts .
no , his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed mt . whitney .
ride the clouds . good picture .
she is a rock star . every day , same time , they come down here and have breakfast . he has the egg white omelet she has the banana pancakes . he sits facing west so he can see his billboard . she faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades .
so that is the problem ?
the problem is murray . he and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the kern a few weeks ago . murray never made it back .
he drown ?
heart attack . apparently they brought a couple hookers along .
so you are thinking what if i was to put you next to my dry cleaner . ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie .
that , or i am thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow saffrin
i am not gonna pop her , harry .
just a thought .
but i could talk to the limo guys . tell em to leave you alone for a while . make the point in a way they would understand it .
you do not even know these guys .
harry , i probably know em better than you do .
what do you get out of this ?
let s see how we get along .
read it . it is a grabber .
they will be looking at you . they do not know who you are .
that is right , they are wondering , who s this guy ? you do not tell em . understand , harry ? do not tell em who i am .
you are kidding , right ?
i do not know , maybe i was not clear . but i thought . . . i told you to keep your mouth shut .
i had to tell em something .
never say anything unless you have to .
i said i would think about it . what does that mean ? in this town , nothing .
that is the difference between you and me , harry . i say what i mean . i want something from someone , i ask em straight out . i want martin weir , i go get martin weir . i do not fuck around with his trainer s shrink .
his shrink s trainer .
hey , harry .
yeah , chili . hi . you are fifty feet in the air !
get the fuck outta my chair .
cash . it happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport .
i mean , at least bo s invested in three of my movies .
yeah , he wants us to talk to buddy , set up a meeting .
a meeting with who ? you and karen ?
i found him .
you have it ?
harry , if i gave you leo s money you would have ray bones all over your ass and then you would be in a whole new kinda trouble .
who ?
ray barboni . guy from miami , owns leo now that momo died .
who the fuck is momo ? jesus , these fucking names . . .
tell you what , harry , tomorrow morning , when the airport s crowded , i will go check it out . if i do not see a problem , i will pick up the money . . .
do not waste your time , harry . the guy s not much of a movie fan . now c mon , gimme the key .
hey , bones , looks like you are gonna have a nice scar up there . maybe these guys can fit you with a rug , cover it up for ya .
he died .
how would you know he died , he tell you ?
personally ?
yeah , ray , he personally told me he got killed in that get away airlines jet went down last month .
what get away jet ?
it was in the herald .
yeah , well , maybe the guy took out flight insurance . check with the wife .
hey , it is your book now . you want to check it out , go ahead . he is got a dry cleaning business out on federal highway .
e . g . means for example , ray . i think what you wanna say is i . e .
bullshit . e . g . is short for ergo .
ask your man here .
twenty seven hundred .
exactly . you either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket , i do not give a fuck . you do not ever hand me a book with a miss in it .
you know , marty , you were good in the cyclone .
martin . it was a beautiful role . all i had to do was find the character s center , the stem i would used to wind him up and he would play , man , he would play .
a few weeks before shooting , i went back to bensonhurst , just to listen to you guys . see , i am italian , but i grew up in tarzana . so i wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech .
we talk different ?
it is more like your attitude . your tone , your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves , in your opinions , your indifference to conventional views .
you mean like we do not give a shit .
yeah . kinda . anyway , once i have the authentic sounds of speech , the rhythms , man , the patois , i can actually begin to think the way those guys do , get inside their heads .
no , i do not . though i have to say i am curious .
so you want to know .
if you would like to tell me , yeah .
i am thinking of a movie .
one of mine ?
one we are producing .
with what ? wiseguy money ?
what happened ? the pressure got to you ?
pressure ? i am the one applied the pressure .
martin , look at me .
i am looking at you .
like this ?
what you are telling me , you are tired ? you wanna go to bed ?
wait . how about this ?
now you are squinting like you need glasses .
that is not bad .
that is what i think of you , asshole . nothing .
i believe it .
i turn it on when i confront the guy .
yeah , but you have not found him yet . the guy took off for las vegas .
how do i know that ?
good looking , too . like karen .
it is not that simple . you have to be careful . there s another guy that comes along , a hard on you owe some money to . a mob guy . wants to take you out anyway , on account of a past situation .
okay . i am listening .
you are not going to tell me the rest ?
buddy ?
yeah , i like it , i am high up , i can see everything , you know ? it is the cadillac of minivans .
that is that ?
compass .
wow . mind if i take it for a spin ?
that is not bad . i think you got it down .
i did not know where else to keep it . where would you ?
you are here a while , that is wrong with a bank ?
they report it to the irs .
you do not open an account , leo , you put it in a safe deposit box . dip in whenever you want .
i am up twelve grand today .
from when ? you left vegas with four fifty ?
who told you that ?
now you are down to three ten in the case . you must have cooled off quite a bit since you got here .
how would you know i was here ?
here s another tip . . .
i would not let her if she tried . why i am here , leo , basically , is to save your ass .
how ? by taking my money ?
you can keep what you won today . that is yours .
it is all mine .
sit down , leo .
at eighteen percent , okay ? and do not ask me no more fucking questions . i am leaving .
i will find you , leo . . .
you see a black leather jacket , fingertip length , like the one pacino wore in serpico ? you do not , you owe me three seventy nine .
maybe you do not see my sign ?
lemme get this straight . you are not responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine , but you are gonna find ray bones coat or get him a new one ? is that what you are telling me ?
mr . barboni is a good customer . works for jimmy capp .
i know who he works for . where is your phone .
you broke in ?
no , it was open . it was not locked .
what if it was ?
i know what a vig is .
that is right . three percent .
but a week . that is a hundred and fifty percent a year .
a hundred and fifty six . some will charge you more n that , go as high as six for five on a short term loan . so three a week s not too bad .
a real bargain .
how much is the wife offered ?
what are you doing here ?
i wanted to come by , apologize for coming into your house like i did last night .
lemme get this straight , you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before ?
no , no . . . you left the patio door open . you gotta stop doing that , all the nice things you got around here .
yeah , well make sure you lock it on the way out .
rough day on the set ?
i spent all day crawling out of a grave . the costumer kept bitching cause i was ripping my nylons
ripped nylons work . makes the shot more real .
. . . that is what we finally decided .
like in bride of the mutant , when you played the whole end with that torn top .
yeah . when you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished . . . when you give us all that look , joan crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence . not even in mildred pierce which by the way was a better book than a movie did crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look .
yeah . . . that was a good scene . i mean , for a horror movie .
for any movie .
i know i am better than what i have been doing the last ten years , walking around in a tank top and fuck me pumps , waiting till it is time to scream .
man , can you scream .
yeah . it is a real gift . i am just saying it would be nice , one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line . you know , like in that bette davis picture , cabin in the . . .
cotton .
yeah , you know when bette comes up to the guy on the porch , gives him a flirty look and says , i would kiss you , but . . .
i married martin . that was a full time job .
you read harry s new one ? he says it is the best thing he is ever read .
he must mean after slime creature .
that why harry came over last night ? see if you could help him get martin in his movie ?
harry s dreaming of a forty million dollar production he will never get off the ground with a star he will never sign . with or without my help .
harry told me martin loves it , he flipped .
yeah , well martin is known for his flipping . he flips over a script , and when the time comes to make a deal , he flips out .
tell you what , i will stop by harry s office and pick up a copy for you .
do not go out of your way .
right . see how your story ends .
yeah . right . listen , touch of evil s playing near my hotel . you wanna go check it out ? watch charlton heston play a mexican ?
i just caught the end .
i already read it . harry left a copy at the house .
what do you think ?
i do not like the title . or the main guy s name .
then you have read it ?
not yet .
you and harry will make a great team . i am gonna make a deal with him .
there a part in it for you ?
i do not want to act in it , i want to produce it with harry . especially if i help him get martin .
sounds fair .
what do you get out of it ?
i want to know .
why does anyone want to be in movies ?
yesterday , you were a loan shark .
and you think the movie business is any different ?
yeah well . . . i like movies . i figure if i help harry make one , i will find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money . that does not sound too hard . i was in the money business and i get ideas all the time .
you were supposed to wait for me with harry at the restaurant .
yeah . we understand you read the script and like it . . . a lot .
the guy s setting you up . you pulled out of their freaks deal so he is paying you back .
depends , who pays ?
definitely not martin . movie stars never pick up the check . they have no idea what things cost . most of them do not know their zip code and a lot do not even know their own phone number .
not unlike the way nicki met him . except it was a wrap party . why ?
i do not know , i am just having some trouble seeing you two together .
you do not like martin much , do you ?
oh , i like him . i just think he is . . . short . i mean , he is a good actor and all , but i am wondering what it was exactly you saw in marty .
for starters , marty was not martin back then .
how about get shorty ? except that is not a movie . that is real life .
how about chili s hollywood adventure .
that is a different story . i am still working on that one , you know , getting the visual fabric just right . although i have added to it .
yeah . there s a girl in it now .
really .
you thought i was faking ?
no . i do not mean that . i just meant in general .
oh .
whichever . let s talk about it tomorrow .
hey , chili ? look at me .
what happened ?
continental , but it does not matter . martin will not order from the menu .
because a movie star can never order straight from the menu . they have to think of something they have to have that is not on the menu .
yeah , harry , you look like you belong in one of your horror movies .
he is doing the same thing you did to him , playing letterman on tv .
it is not dave . it is a movie .
are you going down ?
i do not know .
you are as bad as harry . . .
i will go . i will go .
guy s got a fucking pink toilet , for christ s sake .
oh , shit . . . i am sorry . . . i thought that was . . . i am so sorry . . .
you bet .
you do not act like it ?
i was scared then , not now . how long you want me to be scared ?
go get your stuff .
could not find my toothbrush .
yeah , the guy owes momo a few g s .
what i am thinking is maybe momo could buy it .
that is momo gonna want with an old place , shows old movies people do not care about no more . outside of maybe turning it into a porno house , i do not think he is gonna give much of a fuck . and you already got a job .
that is what the guy said .
tomorrow , i see on the tv weather , it is gonna be nice and warm . you will not need the coat .
do not worry about it . i will not say any more than i have to , if that .
that is the dumbest thing i ever heard . where do you sleep ?
in an armchair . or i go to a coffee shop , sleep there . sit in a booth , pull my hat down .
do not say a fucking word .
you said do not say nothing and i did not .
no , you just broke his fucking nose instead .
you gonna start that again ? you are just like him , all you got room for in your brain is one fucking thing .
all i know is he came by the barber shop , all fucking undone , wanting to know where you were staying in vegas . i told him i do not know . i still do not .
how would he know i was in vegas ? you tell him ?
he already knew it .
yeah , well , i am in l . a . now .
whatta you doing out there ?
i am going into the movie business .
what are you talking about ? you wanna be a movie star ?
i am thinking about producing .
how you gonna do that ? you do not know shit about making movies .
i do not think the producer has to do much , outside of maybe knowing a writer .
hey , chil ? i think you are fulla shit .
whatta you mean , whose point of view the audience s point of view .
get down here . i wanna talk to you . come on . . . right now . . . she is gonna talk to martin ?
what emotiong ? girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick .
she is scared ! fear is an emotion ! look , kid , if you remember anything from your time working with harry zimm , let it be the three key words to filmmaking .
pick ng save .
hm ?
you heard me , pick ng save .
that is great , harry . so that is the
what she did not say was , i just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fucking seasick . all she cared about was that look . all she remembered was that look . and why do we remember things in movies ? because we can see them .
harry zimm . you look like a wet kiss .
come on in .
yeah , lovely . last night i watched two guys carjack a camaro down on the corner of argyle there . what do you want , doris ?
yeah , me too . he was a helluva good writer . and i would know . i discovered him . made him what he was .
what he was , was a hack , could not get a job writing for anybody but you . i am being honest . he was a lousy writer , but he was a good husband . i just did not know it until too late .
you seem to feel fine about it .
i mean morally . murray was my friend .
murray s dead .
no . but now that you mention it , i did talk to a handsome executive at paramount the other day . . . who just happened to get his hands on the script .
yeah , what would he have to say ?
he said if martings interested , i could get a half a million for it easy . but do not worry , harry , i am still giving you until friday .
how honorable of you .
be quiet and listen .
i do not hear anything .
yeah , well i turned off the set . i used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor . you know what could have happened ? the dog came in and stepped on it , turned the tv back on .
i do not have a dog .
you do not ? what happened to muff ?
harry , are you going down , or you want me to ?
harry
i am going .
he is telling me an idea for a movie . it is not bad so far . sit down , have a drink . tell karen , let s see what she thinks .
maybe you did not hear me .
that is where you got the idea ?
yeah , that is what we need . more agents .
well . i got an audition tomorrow .
no problem . you go on off to bed .
oh , yeah , sure .
he happens to be loaning me five hundred grand , no strings , i write any kind of agreement i want .
we ?
chili and me .
mangs in town two days , thinks he is david o . fucking selznick .
once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them , it not only heightens the tension , it adds a wistful element to their love .
mob guy ?
what money ?
the three hundred large . what other money is there ? i should keep quiet , i know , till i have read the script , but i have got a feeling about this one . i am that shylock .
shylock ?
hello , martin .
really .
yeah and i am wondering , how did it go wrong ? how did it all . . . slip away ?
it did not slip away , martin , you did . . . when you went off to fuck nicki in the middle of my birthday party .
i know . i am doing shylock instead of a shylock . okay , that is my motivation ? the acquisition of money . to collect . inflict pain if i have to .
yeah , karen knows him .
but you are interested ?
i am intrigued , yeah . you know what might help you , take a look at the cylone again , the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels . hey this your ride , chili ?
thanks .
and after all , you have such morals .

oh yeah .
a what ?
i do not know what else you would call it . he is breathing on his own , but his pupils are completely blown out . he is totally unresponsive to pain . what happened up there ?
i heard a scream . when i got there i found him on the floor . he was having some kind of seizure . i did not see anybody else .
then what the hell happened to him ?
right . wednesday .
hell no . you think i am crazy ?
why not ?
what ?
get up .
yeah , yeah .
are you kidding me ? jealous ? epps ? gimme a break .
smugglers maybe .
you have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage ? the fittings alone could go for a few million .
if you get it back in one piece .
it is a risk i am willing to take .
the damn thing s been floating around for god knows how long and it has not hit anything yet . so we take it easy . a little of the old push pull .
sounds reasonable .
what is it ?
threw a turbine blade .
how long to fix ?
hard to say . i gotta get in there and have a look . at least a couple days . depending .
turbine rotor s shot .
i thought you said it was just a blade .
metal s crystallized . gotta replace the whole deal .
how much longer s that gonna take ?
like i always say
i know i know , two ways to do anything
the right way and the wrong way .
but how long ?
hard to say .
we gotta get outa here , dodge . a storm blows up and we are history .
i am telling you , you do not want to be running that fan like it is .
what about running number two by itself ?
it is a full horses down . we could not drag that boat down hill on ice with it .
how long , then ?
i gotta pull the blades and re seat everything in a new rotor .
how long ?
three , four days .
goddamit , dodge .
what do you want me to tell you , that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened ? cannot do it , skipper .
man , it gives me the creeps . we got no business towing a ship that size anyway . i say we fix the turbines and hit the highway .
she take a radio ?
what , you think there s something funny about it ?
a ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard , adrift ? and nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it ?
then it happened before they scuttled her .
either way , they must have had a pretty good reason .
a salvage claim to a vessel s cargo s as valid as a claim to the vessel itself . it is ours .
then we are rich . we are damn , filthy stinking rich .
it looks like it .
so we get a little more for the boat . besides , the gold will be safer where it is .
the sooner we get under way , the sooner we are to spending that is ours .
how about you epps ?
yeah , yeah .
warm water current maybe , making the metal expand .
bullshit . that boat has not made steam for fifty years . we found her . she is ours .
not in the eyes of the law .
and what do you propose ? that we knock this guy off ?
why not ? why the fuck not ?
we will stand a watch . four on , eight off . low man first .
yeah , reconsider fucking his shit up .
fresh ai not the first word that comes to mind .
could be meant as a warning .
so whoever did this might still be around .
i might be able to find something on the ship . but it is gonna take time .
do what you need to do . just do it fast .
right .
murphy .
you better get down here quick , skipper . i am on c deck . cabin .
what is it ?
i think you better see this for yourself .
not me .
if they knew what they were carrying .
how do you mean ?
well , they are gonna be asking a lot of questions . about us . about those bodies . about the gold . seems like we oughta be prepared is all .
i guess the best strategy s just to tell them the truth .
yeah , well . the truth is one thing . when there s more than a few hundred million dollars involved , that is a whole new deal .
what do you propose ?
for starters , getting that gold off the ship . what they do not know about is not gonna bother them .
with all due respect , skipper . part of that up there s mine . i would kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it .
i do not know what you are talking about ?
i think you know .
maybe you can tell me then .
the radio . oh , yeah , the radio .
you smashed it !
what ? !
do not lie to me !
what the fuck ?
you did not want us calling anybody . too liable to ruin your big payday .
i did not touch the fucking radio .
conveniently enough for you .
look , i did not touch it . alright ?
you better get down here right now ! we are taking water ! big time !
turbine chamber on number two must have blown ! took out part of the hull !
if money can buy what he wants .
i do not figure there s much i want money cannot buy .
then you are a lucky man .
right .
there s a charming thought .
sorry .
do not fall asleep .
right .
maybe twenty gallons an hour .
show your tatoos to that coxswain last night , did you epps ?
showed him a hell of a lot more than that .
i bet you did .
too big . more like a freighter .
he would let you off at the nearest port , that is for sure .
cargo like this could make a crew think twice .
probably did not have time .
that is what i call a payday .
hell yeah .
hell , yeah . i like it cold . colder the better .
maybe six feet . lanky . i did not get a good look . he was far away . but i saw him . i saw him as sure as you are standing there .
you are a pal .
because of the gold .
no .
headache , nausea , lights ?
lights ?
sudden flashes of light .
i feel fine .
better than starving to death .
yeah . fine . i just thought i heard something is all .
what ?
nothing . let s get outa here .
i did not sign up to go home empty handed . and i sure ai not gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this .
it is my pen name .
salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks . at least . who knows , could be more . could be a lot more . what i am proposing is . . . we split it four ways .
they must have scuttled it . nobody just lets a ship float away .
yeah . thanks .
some charts . a crew manifest . looks like her last voyage was january . the question is where the hell s she been since .
she was sailing up north , right ?
her destination was halifax , yeah .
well , suppose she got a little further north than she should have . got stuck in the ice . the passengers and crew evacuated . she froze into the ice pack , which moved further north , where it froze in solid . they write it off . fifty years later , the whole global warming thing happens . the ice melts , she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her .
nope .
she was a two masted brig boat sailing out of new york in . one day she was sighted off the coast of portugal by a merchant vessel , the dei gratia . as the crew of the dei gratia got closer , they discovered that no one was at the helm of the mary celeste . on boarding , they found her completely deserted . the captain , his wife , their daughter , and the entire crew , all gone . the last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble . the table was even set for dinner . and in the nine days after the last entry , she sailed miles without anyone aboard .
so what did happen ?
nobody knows . there have been a lot of theories , of course . but we will never really know for sure .
you think she is sailing without a crew ?
you are more practical than superstitious .
only way to be .
maybe . but there s always somebody whose interest s at stake .
for now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this .
did you see him ?
who ?
the guy . he just came this way .
what guy ?
there s somebody else on this boat .
what ? what the hell are you talking about .
i saw him . just a minute ago . some guy .
are you sure ?
of course i am sure . i saw him .
you sure it was not me ?
it was not you . it was somebody else . there s somebody else aboard .
we do not exactly have the best bargaining position .
dodge , get on that turbine . i do not care if you do not sleep for a week . the sooner you are done , the sooner we can get out of here . how is the food situation ?
no cowboy shit . right .
yup .
epps .
you just shoot at something ?
yeah . just a bird . just a stupid bird .
greer ?
i do not know . no . not greer . somebody .
i will call us in . dodge , see how many signal flares you can scrounge up . keep an eye on him .
same . any luck ?
no . i will try again later .
possibly false . hence the ima record of being lost at sea . i do not think mutiny s out of the question here .
if they were close enough to shore , they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats .
only something must have gone wrong .
what ?
somebody took it out of commission last night .
but , who ?
february first .
the same day she supposedly went down .
must not have been the captaings entry . he was probably out of the picture by then .
collision ? with what ?
the page s missing . then their sos was real .
but where is the damage ?
maybe the other ship took the worst of it .
if it was a ship she hit .
let em ask . this ship s legally ours now .
does not matter .
hey .
could not sleep .
wish i could say the same .
i guess that is the sixty four thousand dollar question , is not it ?
the what ?
never mind . before your time . i think at least some of the crew went a little nuts . the usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune . equal parts greed and paranoia , usually resulting in homicide . what happened after that is anybody s guess . but , judging by our greek friends down below , it does not look like the last time .
are we smart enough to avoid that ?
i do not know , are we ?
not our mystery guest again .
no . someone else . a girl . i am not sure she was . . . real .
i do not know what else you would call her . one second she was there , the next she was gone .
showing you what ?
what happened .
maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those greeks .
no . i think they are , were , just passengers . innocent victims .
victims of what ?
something bad happened here , murphy .
that much i think we have already established .
more than just a mutiny . more than just the gold .
that is that supposed to mean ?
i do not know .
just lucky i guess .
epps , over .
either of you seen dodge ?
he is not on deck and i cannot raise him on the radio .
right here .
leave him till we can get some help . from now on , nobody comes down here .
could be a stroke . who knows ? the general log said the crew were fighting among themselves . like wild dogs .
over the gold .
maybe it was more than that .
crazy with greed . not crazy . not like him .
if the weather holds it might not be so bad .
it is not the weather i am worried about . the wrong current could drag us as far as the aleutians before we come across another boat .
we hit land .
what ?
we are in an island chain . it is only a matter of time before we hit another one .
greer s gone . he broke out of the tank .
it was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody . you saw it coming as well as i did . dodge had his plans , starting with scuttling the boat . and greer too , except he went nuts . could not take it , i guess . could have happened in the middle of downtown anchorage . but did it make him any less dangerous ? i do not think so .
so you killed them ?
the way i figure it , it was them or me . i thought putting dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch ? bought a little time . made it look like whoever killed those greeks was still around . but it is just us on this ship . us and your . . . spirit friends .
and now you are gonna kill me , is that it ?
i did not want it to turn out this way .
murphy , do not you see that is happening ?
i think i see it pretty well .
it is the ship . the ship s making you think this way .
i know a little bit about human nature and what i have seen only confirms that .
it is a trap . there was no way we were gonna get away with that gold . nobody ever does . it is just the bait . this ship sucks people in and it never lets them out .
i think maybe you been on this boat a little too long , with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo . there s nothing supernatural about greed . and that is what it comes down to , pure and simple .
i do not give a damn about the gold .
i wish i could believe that . either way , you know what i have done . i have got no choice .
go .
of course they did .
let the buyer beware .
what do you say , dodge ?
he will sell the scrap for three times what he paid .
i must be in the wrong business .
you got that right .
better than making hamburger for mickey d .
red sky in morning , sailor take warning .
there s a large vessel out about ten miles to the north west .
alright . i will be right up .
looks like it is adrift .
steer to one eight five . let s check her out .
how is that ?
besides a little rust , everything s pretty well preserved .
sorry .
you mean tow her back ? that is a thirty thousand ton ship you are talking about .
we have done it before .
so we cut her loose and wait it out . a little weather could not be anything she has not seen before .
yeah .
you are up late .
guess i must have fallen back to sleep . where is epps ?
hard to say . maybe forty , fifty million .
ho , baby !
not for fifty million . an ocean liner maybe . but fifty million in gold , they come looking for .
we leave it where it is . stick to the plan .
it is worth the effort . believe me . besides we are gonna need her to prove the salvage .
dodge , you gotta get on those repairs .
we could call for help .
and get a bunch of fools sniffing around here ?
not much at all , i guess . retire . live out my golden years and all that .
moving to sweden .
let s just take it easy here , alright ? nobody s gonna kill anybody .
supposing he wants to get bad with us ?
would you hold on just a minute here , please ? look , there s no reason to panic now . epps saw somebody . fine . it is a big boat . chances are real good he does not even know about the gold . if we stay cool , nobody will be the wiser . the gold stays where it is til we are ready to go . like i said , it will be a hell of a lot safer there than here .
we will have to take it easy then . i do not think we will find much aboard the ship , but it is probably worth looking around .
could not have happened much more than a month ago .
and look what happened .
maybe .
drink up then .
lost my sea legs .
you do not remember ?
last thing i remember i was aboard the chimera . down somewhere in there scavenging around .
you have been out for about a day .
say what ?
dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins .
we heard you scream . any idea what you might have seen ?
i wish i could tell you . i would be real interested to know myself .
alright . everybody grab your gear ! this is where we get off !
the coast guard has our last position . they will send somebody out soon enough . a ship this size you cannot exactly miss .
shut up .
must be a little too the truth , eh dodge ?
a what ?
government weather . it is got a transmitter aboard .
the mooring has not come taught .
must have heard something below deck and went down to check it out .
so whoever did this now has our shotgun .
does not look like it much matters .
leave it .
now hold up just a minute . let s be reasonable here .
you think whoever did this is reasonable ?
all i am saying is that gold s worth a lot more to us now than it ever was .
fine with me .
why not you mind your own business , chief .
did not you hear me , grandpa ? or you got your hearing aid turned down ?
i heard you . but i am choosing to ignore you . epps , let s go .
you got about two seconds to get your paws off me , tarzan .
or what ?
better late than never .
that is this ?
you got a leak in the number nine compartment .
no , no . you got leak .
you pump it out and re seam the hull , she will be good as new .
that cost me twenty grand at least .
fifteen , at the most .
twenty . you knock off twenty and then we see . after my guy looks at it .
you want fair pay , make hamburger for mickey d . otherwise , please to sign .
nope . what are you making , pancakes ?
not if i do not find that goddamn spatula .
it is tough to find a good job without any kind of training .
look , i told you i am not going to college .
well , i think it is good to keep all your options open . you can always enroll for the winter quarter . you could even live here and go to the city college part time , and still get a job if you wanted to .
look at me i am not even listening to a word you are saying .
who ?
guess .
how should i know ?
someone from the past .
who ?
give up ?
yes .
maxine .
not the maxine ?
yup .
god , how horrifying .
i made spaghetti . do you want some ?
i i really have to get up early for class tomorrow .
what is it now ?
are you still looking for a job ?
i guess .
well , maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at computer station . normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience , but she thinks she can convince them .
tell her to forget it i do not need her help .
nothing .
i have got some important news to tell you , but it can wait till later if you are not feeling . . .
what ?
well . . . as you know , maxine and i have been seeing a lot of each other , and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the summer , just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want .
are you going to yell at me ?
about what ?
yeah , i heard about that .
i was in a horrible mood tell her not to worry , i will be completely out of her life in a few days .
she understands what you are going through and she really wants to help you . she says that job at computer station is still available if you want it .
i i am not sure . . . yeah , maybe .
actually , i was just checking to see if you were here your friend seymour is on his way up .
what do you mean on his way up ! ?
i just buzzed him in .
but i cannot
just do it !
oh i love to cook . i guess most women would not invite a man over on the first date , but i believe you should trust your instincts . when i talked to you on the phone you just seemed so . . . i do not know . . . harmless . ready for ice cream ?
yeah . . . where is this ? bosnia ?
was it bosnia ? i forget . . . it is so sad , the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy . a soul funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention . she goes over and turns it up .
oh , i just love this song ! is not it great ? does not it make you want to dance ? c mon !
uh , well , that is okay i do not dance , heh , heh . . .
do not be silly , anyone can dance . here , just follow me . . . watch my feet .
no , really i
oh , all right . . . party pooper ! just let me put a few things away .
uh , no . i missed that one . but what do i know ? i like laurel and hardy movies .
really ? i never really cared for those . why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one ?
dana ! hi ! uh , dana . . . this is enid . . .
hello . . .
oh please do not let me interrupt finish your phone call .
we are almost done . hi . yeah . . . no , it is excluded . they have already paid the earnest money . . . well , let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through . right , great , sounds good !
i uh . . . i feel that i need to uh there s something i feel i have to say . . . i uh , i have never said this to anyone before believe me , i have stayed in horrible relationships for years just so i would not have to do this , but i uh . . .
what are you trying to say ?
it is just that i feel like it is maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out .
please tell me it is not that teenager !
enid and i were just friends . you know . . . we feel comfortable around each other . . . she really likes my old records and . . .
i cannot believe this ! i thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me !
enid . it is sort of like a diary i guess .
it is supposed to be don knotts .
and what was your reason for choosing him as your subject ?
i dunno . . . i just like don knotts .
i see . . . interesting . . .
well , i got the idea when i was doing some research and i discovered that cook s chicken used to be called coongs chicken , and so i decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism . . . and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture . . .
did you actually do this painting ?
well , no it is more like a found art object .
and how do you think this addresses the subject of racism ?
it is complicated . . . i guess i am trying to show how racism used to more out in the open and now it is hidden , or something . . .
and how does an image like this help us to see that ?
i am not sure . . . i mean . . . i guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it is so shocking ?
uh oh .
do not worry it is nothing bad . i was just wondering what your plans were for next year ?
i am not really sure working , i guess . . .
well , i know this is really short notice , but i got a call from a very close friend at the academy of art design and she tells me that i am allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program . . . and , well , i hope you do not mind , enid , but i took the liberty of submitting your name .
as far as i know it includes housing and meals and everything . . . it is really quite an offer . . .
. . . wow . . .
so what do you think ?
i dunno . . . would i have to take classes and stuff ?
well , yes . . .
i . . .
let me know as soon as you can , enid . this could be a great thing for you .
what do you mean ?
the whole business with the art show and the newspaper it is absolutely
huh ?
did not principal jaffee call you ?
i did not check my messages . . .
oh my goodness . . . well , the whole thing is just ridiculous , and as soon as the school board is back in session next fall i am going to do everything i can to help you .
help me what ?
well they are forcing me to give you a non passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition . . . but do not worry i am sure i will be able to get you your diploma in the fall !
but . . . can i still get that scholarship to the art academy ?
i am sorry , enid you have to be an official high school graduate before i can nominate you . i had to give it to someone else . . . but i am sure next year i can
you can count on me , sir !
why ? what difference does it make ? you already got his money . . .
look , that is the policy . . . if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater . . .
but i was only trying to be friendly . . .
look , we do not pay you to be a movie critic just do your job .
okay , okay . . . i will not say a word . . .
what ? i am just kidding around with the customers . . . it is my shtick !
well lose it ! and why are not you pushing the large sizes ? did not you get training about upsizing ?
but i feel weird . . . it is so sleazy .
it is not optional !
jesus . . .
look , i already told you i am not going to give you a ride .
what can you tell me , young man , about the various flavors of frozen yogurt ?
look , i will be done in a minute . just wait outside .
i am afraid i do not understand . i simply wish to know
look , can we talk in a minute ? i am almost done .
who , doug ? he spends more time here than i do . . .
so josh , will you give us a ride ? please ? pretty please ? it is going to be super fun !
no .
it is just an excuse for us to spend time with you .
this is the ultimate . it is like the taj mahal of bad , fake s diners .
so , where is weird al ?
shh ! he is back there . i can see his hair bobbing up and down .
no , i am serious . give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell .
in answer to your question , i suppose i endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form . . .
i figured something like that . . .
oh my god , that is him !
come on , josh . . . do not you want to see where he lives ?
no .
but this guy is like a one of kind , rare butterfly , and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat . . .
you need counseling .
hi .
i just stopped in to say hi .
yeah , well . . . hi . . .
can i come in ?
i guess .
why ?
what do you mean why ?
are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms ?
yeah , right . . .
yeah , right . . . well why not ? that is so wrong with me ?
nothing .
then why do you hate me so much ?
when did i say i hated you ?
you have never once said anything even remotely nice to me .
you make me nervous ! i always feel like you are going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me !
that is just the way i am !
yeah , well
it is just my stupid way of getting attention ! god , i practically love you , josh !
why do you have that stupid poster ?
why do all guys have to play stupid guitars ? it is so typical . . . either they are into cars or guns or sports or guitars . . . it is so obvious . . .
how long have you been up ?
i could not sleep . . . i should get going i feel really weird . . .
do you want to go get breakfast somewhere ?
i do not think we should . . . look , you have to totally promise me you will not tell becky about this .
why not ?
because if you do , i will kill you !
okay . . . i promise .
just take my word for it . . . if she ever finds out about this i will never hear the end of it . . .
hey josh .
are you ready to go ?
i thought chipmunk face was never going to shut up .
i know , i liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict ! she gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she is little miss perfect and everybody loves her .
it is totally sickening . let s see if they gave me the right diploma . . .
what ?
these assholes are saying that i have to go to summer school and take some stupid art class !
why ?
remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year ? i did not think that just because you get an f that means you have to take the class over again .
you loser .
this is so bad it is gone past good and back to bad again . . .
unless they are in your summer school class !
shut up !
uh oh . . . do not turn around . . .
what ? why ?
forget it . . .
i know , she needs to die immediately .
how perfect .
he better watch out or he will get aids when he date rapes her .
good .
god , think about that . . . that is actually totally depressing .
look at these people behind you . i am totally convinced they are satanists .
why ?
just look at them !
soon . . . i have to wait and see how this summer class goes .
did you sign up yet ?
yeah , i just picked the one that sounded the easiest .
god , it is so weird that we are finally out of high school . . . we have been waiting for this our whole life ! now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want . it is such a weird feeling .
i know , it has not really hit me yet .
we should follow them !
in fact , never .
you know , sacrifice virgins and stuff . . .
that lets us off the hook .
or maybe not .
maybe they are slowly poisoning us or they are planning to brainwash us and
okay , okay !
hey , look at this . . .
god , it is so totally pathetic .
i feel as though i have stepped into a time warp !
can we call you weird al ?
you loser !
i know . . . and instead of dessert it says mindbenders .
what does that even mean ?
god , this paper is so boring . who reads all this shit ? here we go . . . windsurfing doctor , mensan iq , maverick sagittarius . let s hit the clubs , make each other laugh !
you can have that one .
okay , well here s yours . . . who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken ? not this one ! stunning bod , very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer .
gross .
god , that is so pathetic . i bet she did not even notice him .
i know . and he is like psychotically obsessing over every little detail .
we should call him and pretend to be the redhead .
oh , we totally have to .
is not it weird ? it is her favorite .
wait . . . i just want to see that is on this tape .
what is this ?
i dunno . john ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that i have to fast forward past to get to the good stuff . there s supposed to be a don knotts movie on here someplace .
you lent it to me in like tenth grade .
i have been looking all over for this .
what a little hosebag .
i remember every minute of that party .
there s my dad with joanie .
i can never keep them all straight was she the super bitch ?
no , she was the second wife . the third one was the super bitch maxine . there ! look at her !
i bet ! actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with you always go for guys with some lame , fake shtick .
what are you talking about who ?
that larry guy what look was he going for ? a gay tennis player from the forties ?
fuck you !
which loser ?
you know , the green cardigan guy .
oh yeah .
why do i always have to do it ?
you are better at it .
i remember when i first started reading these i thought dwf stood for dwarf !
what does it stand for ?
shh , it is his answering machine . . . we hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint beep .
i know , look at the way he drives . . . he is like an old man .
yeah , josh , c mon . . . move it !
it is still twenty five minutes early .
i am going to tell him you said that .
she says she wants to mmph !
what exactly is a cardigan anyway ?
i cannot believe it !
oh my god , he just ordered a giant glass of milk !
he is still just sitting there . god , this is totally unbearable !
i dunno . . .
totally ! look !
we should follow him home .
i know . . . would not you be totally pissed off ?
this kind of thing must happen to him all the time .
he will not see us . . . we will just stalk him from a distance .
i am afraid if i see him , i will start feeling really bad again .
bingo !
come on , it is too late now . . .
gross !
i think it is cute look at his little weasel teeth .
ew , it is like some gross rat . . .
i know . . . i still cannot get over that his name was seymour .
it was so cute how he had his own little bags . i thought i was going to start crying ! . . . do you think they are gay ?
what about the striking redhead in the yellow dress ?
oh yeah . . .
he should totally just kill himself . . . hey , here s one . . . oh wait . . . you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats . . .
i dunno . . . i kind of like him . . . he is the exact opposite of everything i really hate . . . in a way he is such a clueless dork that he is almost cool . . .
that guy is many things but he definitely is not cool . . . this one would be okay , but there s no kitchen . . .
yeah , but . . . you know what i mean .
not really . . .
forget it , i cannot explain it . . .
somewhere downtown .
what , is she black now ?
what are you talking about ?
that is who people want to rent to . it is a known fact that it is way easier to get a job and everything if you are rich . . . all we have to do is buy a few semi expensive outfits and act like it is no big deal . . . it will be fun .
you just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you .
just promise you will do it .
okay , okay , i promise . . . jesus , you are out of your mind .
did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade ?
fuck you , bitch !
it is always closed . . .
i bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back .
let s go hassle josh .
hassle ?
as always .
waiting for the bus that never comes . . .
i wonder if he is just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or
why do not you ask him .
josh !
yeah , he is beyond human stuff like that .
should we leave a note ?
it will only take a second .
it is not like i am some modern punk dickhead . . . it is obviously supposed to be a punk look , but i guess johnny fuckface is too stupid to get it !
i did not get it either .
everybody s too stupid !
hey , you have to see my new good luck charm .
this morning at seymour s garage sale .
god , are not you tired of seymour yet ?
forget it . i am sure it sucks . all these movies suck .
we have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before i start my stupid job .
i know a party we could go to . . .
what ? where ? !
it is a surprise .
i do not believe you .
if i promise you there s really a party with a lot of guys , do you promise you will go ?
aw c mon , this is a fun party .
wait . . .
where did you get that ?
you will not believe it ! guess !
where ?
anthony s ii !
no way . . . when ?
just now . . . i went with seymour .
you cunt !
he does that every single day .
i do not know . . . some people are okay , but mostly i feel like poisoning everybody .
at least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining . . .
he is a total asshole . . . he does not even need that wheelchair , he is just totally lazy !
that rules !
no , it does not . you will see . . . you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos .
but those are our people . . .
yeah , well . . . so when are you going to get your job ?
i am working on it . . . i have got a few leads . . . it is just that right now i have , all these projects that take up all my time .
like what ?
nothing . do not worry . . . i promise i will get a job next week .
god , i cannot believe you went to anthony s without me .
i wonder if i hang around with you because you are like my surrogate mother figure or something . like i have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly .
you hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you .
or maybe . . . did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos ? maybe that is why we spend so much time together .
you are gross . see that guy ?
which one ?
he gives me a total boner !
he is like the biggest idiot of all time !
yeah , right . . . believe me , at this point i am over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me !
face it , you hate every single boy on the face of the earth !
that is not true , i just hate all these obnoxious , extroverted , pseudo bohemian losers ! sometimes i think i act so weird because i am crazy from sexual frustration .
have not you heard about the miracle of masturbation ?
. . . maybe we should be lesbos . . .
get away from me !
yeah , maybe it will be okay . at least i will get to see every movie for free , i guess . . . i had to lie and tell them i already graduated . . .
when are you finally going to get your diploma ?
i dunno , but next week is my last class . . .
anyway , now we can start looking for the apartment . . . do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment ?
was not it like eighth grade ?
seventh . . . you wanted to move out right then !
that must have been when my dad was married to maxine . . .
i remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick daniel dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him .
we were such desperate sluts back then .
i told you my manager was a total asshole ! do not worry , i am going to get another job . . . and anyway , i have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime . . .
fuck it . everything must go !
oh my god , i remember this hat . . . this was during your little old lady phase . . .
oh yeah right , like i am gonna let some asshole with a goatee own goofy gus .
do not worry .
if it makes you feel any better , i do not think you could have gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff .
yeah , thanks .
i cannot , it is seymour s birthday . . . shit ! what time is it ? i have to go to the store ! i was going to make him a cake . . .
well , are we still going shopping tomorrow ?
yeah , i guess . . . call me . . .
go ahead . . .
no , really . . .
god , you are really obsessed . . .
i am not i just think it would be funny to see what he would do . . .
i thought we decided that josh was way too cool to be interested in sex , and that he is the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that . . .
yeah , but maybe one of us should at least try . . .
no matter what happened it would be a big disaster . . . let s just try and keep everything the way it is .
i cannot afford stuff like this right now .
i am sick of waiting we need to start getting stuff if we are ever going to move . are not these the greatest towels ?
why do you care about this kind of stuff ?
do not you want nice stuff ?
i cannot imagine spending money on towels .
you do not have to . i will pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job .
you are insane .
do you still want to go to that thing tonight ?
what thing ?
that guy s band is playing tonight . . . alien autopsy .
oh yeah . . . maybe . . . seymour s going on his big date tonight and i kind of want to be around when he calls , so i can hear how bad it went .
god , i am so sick of seymour .
do you still want to do something tonight ?
what happened to seymour ?
i cannot believe it he actually scored !
how repulsive !
so should i come over ?
actually , i am just about to go out with some friends . . .
what are you talking about ? who ?
just some people from work . . .
i do not believe you .
yeah well , you said you were busy . . . look , i would better get going . . . i will call you tomorrow .
it is a totally normal , average neighborhood !
i just mean it is weird to me . . . i have never been anywhere near here in my life .
josh says this is a really good neighborhood . . .
what ? when did you see josh ? !
he came into work .
why ? what did he say ?
nothing .
when was this ?
i do not know ! god , do not act so jealous i only talked to him for two minutes .
great . . .
what ? ! it looks totally normal . . . that is wrong with it ?
i said great . . .
oh yeah , i can tell you really love it !
well , what am i supposed to say ? i cannot wait to live in some depressing shit hole in the middle of nowhere ? !
there s something wrong with every single place we look at ! why do not you just come right out and tell me you do not want to move in with me ? !
because you will freak out and act like a total psycho about it .
you are the one who s still living out some stupid seventh grade fantasy !
fuck you ! have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life !
i need to talk to you .
i do not know . . . i was thinking maybe i should live alone . i decided to rent that place we looked at . i am moving in next week .
please let me come with you . please please please . . .
i do not know i am not sure it is a good idea .
of course it is a good idea . . . it is our plan .
but how are you gonna pay rent and everything ? you do not even have a job .
i will get a job tomorrow , i promise . if i do not , you can totally tell me to fuck off .
it is fine .
so where is all your stuff ?
that is all you are bringing ?
i am gonna finish packing tonight . . . i will bring it over tomorrow sometime .
what time ?
i dunno . . .
make sure you are here by noon we have tons of stuff to do . . . oh yeah ! i have to show you something else !
oh , hi . . . i almost did not recognize you i think i need to get glasses you are all blurry !
you are lucky then , you cannot see the veins on that guy s biceps .
actually , he is a really nice guy .
maybe an orange juice .
it just came yesterday . . .
oh , hey enid . . . so . . . we finally made it !
really ? both of you ? . . . why not ?
just because .
well i am going to major in business administration and , i think , minor in communications .
see , that is exactly the kind of thing we are trying to avoid .
yeah , we graduated high school how totally amazing .
so what are you guys doing this summer ?
nothing .
i am going to be in this actor s workshop , and i am hoping to start going on auditions soon . i am so excited to finally have some free time . we have to get together this summer !
oh yeah , that will definitely happen . . .
well , bye you guys . . . congratulations !
what are you doing here , melorra ?
my acting workshop is across the street from here . i am just on my break .
well , we will not keep you .
i love this place . . . it is so you know , funky .
i am taking a remedial high school art class for fuck ups and retards .
shhh !
i want to know what you think you are doing , staying out all night and worrying your father to death !
oh yeah , like he even noticed .
listen , young lady . . . i know you do not like me i do not really care whether you do or not but i will not allow you to treat your father the way you do .
a mongoose . . . they eat snakes . . . you never heard of a mongoose ? that is a classic piece of vintage taxidermy . nobody alive today knows how to do work like that .
how much is this ?
umm . . . that is not officially for sale . . . i might have to hang onto that for the time being .
that is okay . . .
seymour does .
who does ?
him . seymour . he is the man with the records .
i thought it was not for sale .
i am thinking maybe i could let it go . . .
it is kind of falling apart .
where did you get those pants ?
tell me what ?
punk rock is over !
i know it is over , asshole , i
if you really want to fuck up the system you should go to business school that is what i am gonna do get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside !
that is not even
yeah yeah yeah . do you have my money ?
that tape sucked , by the way !
i am so sorry if you were offended !

norman .
. . . are you waiting for a bus ?
yes .
i hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago . . . there are no buses on this street .
you do not know what you are talking about .
you are late , asshole .
fine , and how are you ?
did you bring that tape ?
i did too !
tsk ! you jews are so clever with money . . .
fuck you , you stupid redneck hick !
hey , where are you going ?
later , dude .
what ?
five hundred .
you are crazy it should be like two dollars !
i was wearing that dress the day i lost my virginity .
well why do i care about that ?
why do you even want it ? it would look stupid on you .
god , fuck you !
indian records ?
you know , like weird s indian rock ng roll music .
i do not have anything after about . i may have one hindu from the twenties in my collection , but it is not really for sale . i do not really collect foreign .
sure ! . . . wait , maybe not s , but i can play regular records . . .
sure , i guess .
well there s a few choice lps in here that re issue some really great old blues stuff .
nah , it is not so great . here s the one i would recommend .
wow !
a dollar seventy five .
okay .
so you really liked it ? yeah , there s some really rare performances . you liked that memphis minnie , huh ?
yeah , that is good too . . . the whole record was good , but that one song , devil got my woman i mostly just keep playing that one over and over . . . do you have any other records like that ?
the skip james record ? yeah , that is a masterpiece . there are no other records like that ! i actually have the original of it in my collection . it is one of maybe five known copies .
wow !
do you want to see it ? i can run upstairs and get it . . .
yeah , sure , i guess . . .
watch my stuff .
no ! ! !
hey , i was only kidding !
i . . . i did not think you would have any interest in this get together . . . i mean if you had told me you were coming i would have warned you it is not like a real party or anything .
you are right about that . so this is your record collection ?
oh god no . this is just junk i have for sale or trade . the record room is off limits .
really ? can i see it ?
yeah , well sure . . . you can if you want to . . . it is just i do not want all these guys in there at once . . . you know . . .
i have about fifteen hundred s at this point . i have tried to pare down my collection to the essential . . .
god , look at this poster ! i cannot believe this room ! you are the luckiest guy in the world ! i would kill to have stuff like this !
please . . . go ahead and kill me ! this stuff does not make you happy , believe me .
oh , come on ! what are you talking about ?
you think it is healthy to obsessively collect things ? you cannot connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff . . . i am just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers .
yeah right . . . if i am so cool , why have not i had a girlfriend in four years ? i cannot even remember the last time a girl talked to me .
i am talking to you . . . i will bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute !
oh , right . . .
no really . . . i guarantee i could get you a date in like two seconds . . .
good luck . . .
i am totally serious !
yeah , well . . .
i mean it you leave everything to me i am going to be your own personal dating service !
i appreciate the offer but you really do not
mark my words , by the end of this summer you will be up to your neck in pussy !
jesus ! that is very nice of you enid but i i really
i do not know , what kind of question is that ? i mean it is totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me . . .
but putting that aside for now , would you go out with her ?
i really did not get a good look at her .
jesus !
c mon seymour , i am trying to collect data here ! do not you want me to find you your perfect dream girl ?
i am just not one of those guys who has a type . . .
every guy has a type !
i mean as long as she is not a complete imbecile and she is even remotely attractive . . .
maybe i do not want to meet someone who shares my interests . i hate my interests ! where can i go to meet the exact opposite of myself ?
yeah yeah yeah . . . just tell me your five main interests , in order of importance .
well , let s see . . . i guess i would have to put traditional jazz , blues , and ragtime music at the top of the list , then probably . . .
let s just say music that way you only use up one . . . wait , we have to go in here for a second . . .
josh ? he is nobody s boyfriend . . . he is just this guy that becky and i like to torture .
well are
oh my god ! we have to go in here !
please , seymour . . . becky and i have been dying to go in here but we cannot get any boys to take us . . . please ?
i i would really rather not . . .
we will just go in for one minute it will be a riot !
i do not think so . . .
please ? we have to !
i really do not think it is a good idea .
fine , i will go by myself then . . .
shh !
oh my god !
these are older women just dressed up to look young . . . i think .
c mon , seymour , please ?
that thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud it is like someone jabbing me in the face ! kfto coming atchya on this beautiful evening . . .
i brought it for him to autograph . he is going to be amazed to see it it is one of two known copies . . . i cannot believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner . what an insult !
this bar s going to be packed with girls for you to pick from .
i am not holding my breath in that department .
jesus , seymour .
well , offer her a seat ! you want me to do it ?
wait a minute ! hang on ! jesus , i gotta think of something to talk to her about . no ! no . . .
just wait here .
i told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label .
jesus . . .
now i remember why i have not gone anywhere in months . i am not even in the same universe as those creatures back there . i might as well be from another planet .
we just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who is not a total idiot , that is all .
look , i really appreciate your help , enid , but let s face it , this is hopeless .
it is not hopeless . . .
yeah , well it is simple for everybody else give em a big mac and a pair of nikes and they are happy ! i just cannot relate to . of humanity .
yeah , well , i cannot relate to humanity either , but i do not think it is totally hopeless . . .
but it is not totally hopeless for you . . . i have had it . i do not even have the energy to try anymore . you should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything i do so you do not end up like me . . .
i would rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar . . . at least you are an interesting person . . . at least you are not exactly like everybody else . . .
hooray for me .
it does not matter , i am not staying long . . . i just want to make sure i convince you not to give up yet .
yet .
if you do not mind my asking why do you care so much if i get a date or not ?
i dunno . . . because i cannot stand the idea of a world where a guy like you cannot get a date . . .
what ? . . . oh that . . . i borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago . . . i guess it is mine now .
what , are you a klansman or something ?
yeah , right , i am a klansman thanks a lot ! . . . do you know the cook s chicken franchise ?
four piece cook s special deep fried with side ng slaw it is out ray geous !
yeah , well cook s is just a made up name . when they originally opened back in they were named the coon chicken inn that is an early painting of their first logo .
you work at cook s chicken ?
for nineteen years . . .
what are you , a fry cook or something ?
nothing so glamorous . . . actually , i am an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters .
jesus , i would go nuts if i had to work in an office all day .
hey , i get good benefits , a good early retirement plan , nobody ever bothers me . . .
yeah , but still . . .
i make enough money to eat and buy old records . . . what more do i want ?
no , in a lot of ways things are better now . . . i dunno . . . it is complicated . everybody still hates each other , but they know how to hide it better , or something . . .
hey , can i borrow this ?
what ? why ?
i promise i will take good care of it .
i dunno . . . they are very sensitive at work about all this stuff . maybe it would be better if you
do not you trust me , seymour ?
oh . . . uh , thanks a lot enid . . . i really appreciate it . . .
no , doofus . . . blow it out !
are you okay ?
it is just my stupid back . i will be all right in a minute . . .
oh . . . uh . . . it is just this elastic thing i have to wear for lumbar support . . .
what , like a girdle ?
maybe now you understand why i cannot get a date .
yeah , well , you are not the only one . everybody i know has totally fucked up problems . . . it seems like only stupid people have good relationships . . .
that is the spirit !
i mean , i am eighteen years old and i have never even had a real , steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks !
really ?
never . . .
i am starting to think that even if i did get a girlfriend it really would not change anything .
i know . it is not like it makes all your problems go away .
then again , that is easy for me to say , since i will never even get a date . i am sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you .
actually , i have got a total crush on this one guy right now , but it is a really fucked up situation . . .
oh yeah ?
oh wait , you met him . . . remember that guy josh ? i am like practically obsessed with him , but i cannot do anything about it because becky would freak out .
why ?
never mind , it is way too complicated . . . did you have problems like this when you were my age where you are totally confused all the time ?
i will not even dignify that with a response .
who knows ?
let the machine get it . i have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me . . .
it is just somebody s idea of a joke . . .
that did not sound like a joke to me . . . what , did you write a personal ad or something ?
uh yeah . a long time ago . . . she called before once . . . it is just somebody trying to humiliate me .
seymour ! i promise you that was not a joke you have to call her back !
how can you be so sure ?
well , uh . . . i am an expert about stuff like this she was totally for real !
hi , it is me . . .
oh , hi . . .
so , what happened ?
actually , it is kind of still happening . . . she is over here right now . . . i think everything s going pretty well . . .
what ? you are kidding me . . .
yeah , so i better go it is not really the best time to talk . . .
what , are you going to like have sex with her on your first date ?
jesus , enid . . . i will talk to you later . . . bye !
yaaa !
really ?
no , actually joe told me you were here . . . so how come you never call me anymore ?
i know , i am sorry . . . i i have been really busy . . .
yeah , i will bet ! so , how is it going with that is her name ? dana ?
oh . . . pretty well , surprisingly . . . you know . . .
so , what kind of stuff do you guys do together ? is she into old records and stuff ?
sort of . . . she does not dislike any of that stuff . . . she is trying , anyway . . . actually , we are supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon . . .
sounds good . . .
what , are you trying to get rid of me ?
no . . . no , it is just that i should get going in a few minutes , and
are not you even going to ask me how i am doing ?
i i am sorry . . . uh so . . . uh . . . how
i dunno . . . okay , i guess . . . i fucked that guy josh finally . . .
. . . so . . . is he your boyfriend now ?
maybe . . . i dunno . . . he wants to be , of course . i am weighing several offers at the present time . . .
i . . . i do not know . i do not really think i should . . .
of course you should . c mon , i am already a million hours late .
. . . i better not . . .
well forget the art show . . . let s do something else .
i . . . i wish i could , enid , but i really cannot right now . . . i it is just that i
well when can we do something ?
it is just that , well , you know , dana just got out of a really bad relationship and i do not want to give her the wrong idea . . . you know . . .
and you like them ?
well , you know . . . what do i know about clothes . . . i have never been the most fashionable guy it is nice to have someone do all the work for me . . .
so that is it ? you do not ever want to see me again ?
no , of course i do . . . it is just that right now i need to
that is her problem anyway ? did she actually tell you you could not see me ?
no , no . . . not exactly . . . she just does not understand how i would know somebody like you . . .
what does she mean by that somebody like me ?
just someone so young . . .
you must have done something to make her think you like me .
i . . . i do not think so .
does that mean you do not like me ?
no , of course not .
so , do you like me , seymour ?
in what way do you mean ?
in whatever way you think i mean .
i do not know . . . i am sorry , but dana s a very jealous person . i just do not want to screw that up right now . . . i am sure she will dump me soon and we can go back to being friends . . .
i do not think you understand how i really feel about you , seymour .
. . . what do you mean ?
nothing . do not worry , i will not bother you any more .
i had to see you .
that is up ?
can you at least let me in ?
uh . . . sure . . . come in .
look , i just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then i will leave you alone .
that is the matter ?
do you have anything to drink ?
what about this ?
fuck dana . i am sick of dana .
i could never move i have got too much stuff .
dana bought it when we went antique shopping . she said it did not go with her stuff , so she gave it to me . . . she thought it fit in better with my old time thingamajigs .
jesus , how can you stand her ?
that is great ! half empty that is what i like about you , seymour , you are a natural pessimist !
if you expect the worst , you are never disappointed .
what are you talking about ? you are disappointed every minute of your life .
i am just being realistic .
at least you are not like every other stupid guy in the world all they care about are guitars and sports . . . they are all such fags !
i hate sports .
how come in all that time i was trying to get you a date , you never asked me out ?
you are a beautiful young girl . . . i cannot imagine you would ever have had any interest in me , except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity .
yeah , but still . . . it is kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that .
i mean . . . of course i . . . why would not i want to go out with you ?
i dunno . . . i always feel like everybody secretly hates me . i am just paranoid i guess . i mean , you like me do not you ? we are good friends , right ?
yeah , sure . of course .
. . . maybe i should just move in here with you . . . i could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until i get a job .
what about joe ?
oh yeah . . . and dana . . . you were a lot more fun before you met dana . you have been acting way too normal lately . . . you are a bitter , twisted , fucked up guy , seymour , that is why i like you .
yeah , well i like you too . . .
what ?
i used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place . . . do you ever think about stuff like that ?
i guess i probably used to when i was your age .
it would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it , and i would just disappear and they would never see me again .
sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems .
you know what we should do ? let s go get in your car right now and just take off ! we could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life . . . fuck everybody !
i do not think i am in any condition to drive .
i will drive , then we will go out in a blaze of glory !
so where would we go ?
who cares ? let s just go . . . that is stopping us ?
i dunno , i . . .
i am serious ! i am just so sick of everybody ! why cannot i just do whatever i want ?
what do you want ?
what do you want ?
i i i . . .
that is the matter with you , seymour ? do not you like me ? be a man for once in your life !
. . . do you really want us to drive away somewhere ?
what ? . . . maybe . . . no . . . i dunno . . .
i will if you want to .
no . . . forget it . . .
i i never expected anything like this to happen . . .
yeah , well . . . me neither . . .
you must know i always . . . did you really mean all that about moving in with me ?
i was just thinking out loud . . . i mean , you have got this whole thing with dana i am not going to let you fuck that up . . .
but , i . . .
shhh . . . i really need to get some sleep .
i can treat him any way i want to i am an adult ! leave me alone !
they are seymour s .
seymour ? you gotta be kidding me !
do not worry about it . he is not getting any and neither are you .
let me tell ya something , joe . . . listen to me , joe . . . you cannot hit a home run without swinging the bat !
right .
yeah , i am really , really happy . really having a good time .
still torturing yourself over that enid , huh ?
maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy . who knows ? it could be a million things . it is wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain , that is for sure .
yeah , well . . . thanks for cheering me up .
no problem .
forget it , there s no way . . . find some other poor sucker to abuse .
he has every reason to freak out this is a totally fucked up thing to do to somebody !
i wish i could see him .
yeah .
call me sometime .
i am .
talk to us about it . . .
it is my response to the issue of a womangs right to choose . . . it is something i feel super strongly about .
is not this a wonderful piece , class ? this definitely falls into that higher category of art i was speaking of earlier .
it is a tampon in a teacup . . .
it is a found object . . . that is when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art .
very good . now , what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent ?
i guess i see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood , because of tea parties in the olden days , but instead of tea i was trying to kind of confront people with this . . . like . . .
this shocking image of repressed femininity !
right , exactly !
i think it is really a wonderful piece , margaret !
she is not at home ?
no . . . they said she was here . . .
what the fuck is she doing ? ! she was supposed to be here three hours ago !
uh , do you mind if i wait ? i really need to talk to her .
are you sure she was not there ? maybe she was just hiding from you .
why would she be hiding from me ?
i do not know . . . where is she , then ?
maybe she is with josh ?
josh ! ? why would she be with josh ?
i do not know .
why ? what did she tell you ?
she just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating i thought maybe she was . . .
what ? is she having some secret affair with josh ?
i have no idea i just want to . . .
why would not she tell me ? there s no way ! she could never keep that to herself . . . you are crazy .
really , i do not know enough about it to . . .
that slut !
why did you say she might be hiding from me ? did she say anything to you about me ?
yeah , she thinks you are a dork .
did she say that ?
look , what do you expect ? considering how we met you .
what do you mean ?
on that pathetic fake blind date .
what are you talking about ?
did not she ever tell you about that ? god , she really is pathological . . .
what fake blind date ? what are you talking about ?
so tell me more about this job . what exactly will you be doing ?
well , mostly archival research , cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their cd reissues . it is really . . . i cannot believe it .
remember what i said when we first started this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you !
it does not pay very much , but i should be able to afford my own place in a few months . . . do you think that is too soon ? i am really anxious to get my record collection out of storage . . .
why do not we start with that next week ?
do not thank me . you are doing all the work .
yes ?
do you have a check for me ?
malaria epidemic very sudden .
let me see the sick .
oh , you are a doctor now , too ?
there is no reason for fear .
on that i choose to remain dubious . two are dead now in two nights .
you do not call me a liar you know nothing of their health consider yourself fortunate i persuaded so many to stay consider yourself fortunate i have decided to stay
you think you matter ? beaumont is on that train he matters
he will replace you , too that is all you really care about .
you think so ? fine . it is best you get out . go . tell all your people to go , run home where they will be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done , they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here , they were the only ones to flee
as are they all .
that is ridiculous talk and you cannot seriously believe it
now you are telling me my beliefs ? i do not think so
at last you are right we do you are the problem in tsavo
careful , abdullah
you do not know all that has happened here the devil has come to tsavo .
you are right . the devil has come . look at me . i am the devil .
am i to take it you want to live ?
most certainly . absolutely . yes .
excellent decision . your name is abdullah ? i am sure we will meet again . go and enjoy the splendid morning .
i think it is been a pleasure .
how we do not know where they are ?
we will have to make them come to us , will not we ? and since there are two of them , we are going to set two plans in motion . first we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night .
my wife is the game player in the family , sir .
games ? look at me closely , patterson i am a monster . my only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me , such as yourself . one mistake and i promise you this i will make you hate me .
i am sure you have examined my record . so you know i have never yet been late on a bridge .
you have never built in africa .
but i have in india every country presents problems .
you will need your confidence , i promise you .
i have got a reason far beyond confidence my wife is having our firstborn in five months and i promised i would be with her when the baby comes .
very moving , patterson i am touched you confided in me . but i do not really give a shit about your upcoming litter . i have made you with this assignment do not make me break you .
you will not have the chance . any further words of encouragement ? then i have a train to catch .
how could it be ? i hate africa .
do not they , though ?
so work must be going well ?
but overall , you are pleased ?
starling ?
awhile back he ordered some bibles i have brought them . is he here ?
yes he is .
well , i need to speak to him .
that is the surprise in that , this is africa ?
it has not been that simple so far .
what have they done besides kill starling ? how many have they killed ?
i am calling it my contraption we are going to surround it with a boma a fence , to you and we are going to leave a small opening opposite that door .
genius the beast will enter , tripping the wire , the door will slide down , trapping him , you , safe behind the bars , will have him at your mercy and will shoot him .
i did not conceive of it for the lions i built one in india when there was trouble with a tiger .
and it worked ?
in point of fact , it did not . but i am convinced the theory is sound .
i made a mistake hiring you you are simply not up to the job .
you genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people , do not you ? well , fine except there is not a higher rated engineer and we both know that . and since time is so important to you , how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here ?
all they will bring is more chaos and we have plenty of that already and if they come in , word will get out and what happens to your knighthood then ?
i am going to try and locate redbeard i assume you have heard of him .
every man who s ever fired a rifle has heard of him by the time you find him , the lions will be dead .
very well , the job s still yours , i will go . but if i have to return , you are finished . and i will then do everything i can to destroy your reputation . am i not fair ? told you you would hate me .
not a time for modesty , bob
then why do you stay ?
who else would hire me ? beat you to it , did not i ? oh yes , almost forgot brought you a little welcoming gift .
karim will have to show me where it happened . and of course , i will need the donkey . with any luck , i will sort it out tonight .
you do not enjoy killing , do you ?
then why do it ?
you never had it .
nigel and i do not like each other much .
well , he got away , did not he ? riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them donkey took the brunt of it then suddenly the lion ran off .
please you need not be so graphic
you intend sorting this out tonight ?
is it , i am sorry , but then , of course , you are the doctor , you should know .
silliest thing i ever heard of why in the world should we go through all that ?
i suppose i could answer you . i suppose i could explain that the place is so inviting , what with the smell of blood and flesh , that they have to strike . it is even possible that i tell you i found some fresh paw marks around back which means they are already contemplating feasting here . but i do not want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that i do not have the least idea what i am doing , that i am nothing but an incompetent , that i am a fool . anyone who finds me a fool , please say so now .
i have been desperate for patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived .
then we agree .
we are not much good at goodbyes , helena .
tell me about beaumont does he understand how brilliant you are , how lucky he is to have you ?
it was embarrassing the man showered me with compliments .
well , it is just . . . . . . other men do not abandon their wives at such a time
oh please if i would been against your taking this , you would have abandoned me . you have been desperate to see africa your whole life .
what if there are complications ?
not what if there will be , there always are . which only means that our son and i note my confidence will have an excuse to come visit .
i am desperate to see africa but i hate the leaving .
we have hunted since childhood .
all right you will spend your nights inside . you will have plenty of ammunition . you are totally protected , you have really nothing to fear .
that is correct . nothing .
i would never make excuses but a fire broke out the light was bad he kept moving
well , of course he kept moving but he could not have been more than ten feet away from the three of you surely you must have wounded the thing
i assure you we came close many times
he just gave me his monster speech .
that . i know robert seems dreadful , but when you truly get to know the man , well , he is much worse . and i am one of his defenders . forget him for now it is your first ride to tsavo i think you will find it breathtaking .
the females are bigger only animal here like that have to be or they would not survive because the males eat the young .
just that they fart through their mouths . must make kissing something of a gamble .
i have lived in africa a year and i do not know what you know . how long have you been here ?
almost three hours . but i have been getting ready all my life .
beaumont says it is to end slavery .
we all have our reasons . mine is simply to make them understand happiness , accept salvation , know the serenity that comes best i stop . one of the by products of my belief is that i can become amazingly boring . but i know god smiles on me .
have you got that in writing ?
does he speak english ?
i have got medical supplies to deliver . come along to the hospital when you are done .
and anxious to get started . what is this , mostly malaria ?
yes but their suffering is only transitory once they except god into their hearts , he will vanquish all pain .
well , he put me in a spot , did not he ? but that is all right after all , i am responsible for everything that happens here . and it certainly will not do much for morale if a man eater s on the prowl .
we know three things about man eaters . first , they always return to where they have attacked before . second , they are always old they cannot catch other animals so they turn to us . and third , they are always alone they have been cast out by their pride because they cannot keep up .
might be exciting for you .
i have never been all that adventurous . i would not be in the way ?
i would love the company . and i have hunted all my life .
well , why not ? you seem so calm and experienced . why not , indeed !
shhh .
i am sure you mean that to be comforting , but
you will have to deal with it , nigel .
that is precisely my plan but back in my tent .
what ?
since you would only been here three hours when we met , are you sure this is how you hunt lions ?
not to terrify you , nigel , but it is worse than you think i have never even seen one .
so that is what a lion looks like .
true enough but without the comedy relief .
are not we full of ourselves today ? i think it is because of the lion .
possibly .
you do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just there .
in your honor , nigel . and you and singh will be in charge of building them and you will also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars and you will be finished in eight thrilling weeks .
john , it will not be easy .
nigel , you will just have to use your hands
but you said they were always old .
that is what the books say . . .
far end of camp man wandering alone at night . hawthorne s examining the body now . there s even less of him than of singh .
but it is crazy the lion should not be that hungry this soon . samuel ?
you mean nobody died ?
we all worked together . worthy deeds were accomplished . i liked the labor . my mother insisted on piano lessons broke the dear womangs heart when i turned out to be tone deaf but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands . i like the blood , is that strange ?
what did i do ?
got me out of trouble .
nonsense samuel would have done something .
we need to talk .
let me save time you are the engineer you are in charge you are sorry i am here . right so far ? good because i am not an engineer , i do not want to be in charge , and i am sorrier than you are that i am here i hate tsavo . so i will help you by killing the lions and leaving , and you will help me by doing what i tell you so i can leave . see any problems ?
actually , no .
all right let s go into battle . i am redbeard .
somehow i guessed .
that is very considerate .
i am always considerate my mother taught me that .
no , but you do see , you were needed after all . and fifty warriors at the camp before dawn .
i can try .
samuel says you killed a lion .
it was probably luck i would rather you did the shooting .
you would never force the lion to me and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck . around there s a clearing you will know it from the anthills get there and hide and listen to the sounds i will make the lion come directly to you .
has it ever done that before ?
. . . do not know . . .
have you ever failed ?
only in life . . .
it is all right . stay ready . they know it is there .
but of course yours worked .
in point of fact it did not but i am convinced the idea is sound .
you just got hit . the getting up is up to you but they are only lions and i am going after them crack of dawn . . .
what happened to them ?
i got big .
nobody s seen anything like this . lions do not have caves like this they are doing it for pleasure .
do not they have to be ? . . .
not for me i am too bulky and it is your idea , you go up there . take the others to the water tower for the night .
i will be bait alone ?
yes . and i will be in some distant tree where i can provide no assistance whatsoever . can you control your fear ?
i will have to .
i cannot control mine i would be lost without the shame factor driving me .
was that supposed to make me feel better ?
you think they will come then ? why ?
good luck .
why ?
because i think they are after you .
the most of any lions . . . a hundred . . . ? probably more . johnny . . . ?
understood you realize now you could never have done it without me .
actually , i could have done it much more easily without you , but for whatever reason , i am glad you came .
because they are here . because tsavo is the worst place in the world . come , john to the bridge .
thank you . the truth is this you have to work at it constantly .
the workers do not get on ?
get on ? they detest each other . obviously the africans hate the indians . but the indians also hate the other indians . some of them worship cows , while others eat them .
this is more difficult
clearly you do not agree about building the railroad ?
you they cannot believe you are still here .
nonsense .
you do not know what tsavo means , do you ? it means slaughter . . .
fine . get started . and a strict curfew no one allowed out at night . send half your men to the bridge , the rest with these two . and i am sorry for my tone earlier . but i repeat there is no reason for fear . i will kill the lion and i will build the bridge .
look out , samuel , here it comes .
thank you , samuel .
good news ?
i expect so it is from my wife .
do you love her ?
i do , actually very much .
you give me hope , john .
i have to ask why do you need me ?
oh yes . but it takes time .
you have known him long ?
since his beard was red .
he does not . he needs nobody . but we have hunted many times . . . . . . he knows i am afraid of lions . . .
i feel the same about the bridge . this country certainly did not ask for it , does not need it .
once . . .
underneath . somewhere .
it is all right , samuel we all get hit
i do not believe you had a mother .
four should do it .
they will want a lot of money .
because i have two plans to kill the lions one involving the cattle , the other the men .
not even close . what happened ?
and where will you sleep beautifully ?
patterson and i will be in the old hospital where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers and by the time we are done , i promise you , the odor of blood will be irresistible .
some russian princes want to hunt the himalayas . you ?
help finish the railroad .
some mysteries should not have solutions .
hold your son high .
you know , you are really doing very good work here . i think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations .
thank you , janosz . i have learned a lot here , but now that my baby s a little older , i was hoping to rejoin the orchestra .
actually , i am not eating lunch today . i have an appointment . in fact , i would better go .
i am sorry . perhaps some other time .
okay , i will take a raincheck on that .
hello , dana . i happened to be in the neighborhood and i thought i would stop by to see if everything s all right with you you know , with the blackout and everything ? are you okay ? is the baby all right ?
no , everything s fine . honestly . thanks anyway .
okay , just thought i would check . good night , dana . sleep well . do not let the bedbugs bite you .
good night , janosz .
oh , i am sorry . this is peter venkman . peter , janosz poha .
no harm will come to the child . you might even say it is a privilege . he will be the vessel for the spirit of vigo . and you well , you will be the mother of the ruler of the world . does not that sound nice ?
if this is what the world will be like , i do not want to live in it .
i do not believe we have the luxury of choice .
everybody has a choice .
not in this case , my dear . take a look . that is not gainsborough s blue boy up there . he is vigo !
i do not care who he is . he is not taking my baby .
we do not have a relationship .
i know . marry me , dana , and together we will raise vigo as our son . there are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god . i am sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment . and perhaps a car and free parking .
i hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul . i could never forgive what you have done to me and my child .
many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance , but after a while i believe we could learn to love each other . think about it .
i would rather not .
i am not saying you did . in science we always look for the simplest explanation .
i am trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field . it is a theory ray and i were working on when we had to dissolve ghostbusters .
okay , whatever you think but not venkman .
oh no .
do you ever see him ?
occasionally
how is he these days ?
venkman ? i think he was borderline for a while there . then he crossed the border .
does he ever mention me ?
no . not that i can recall .
certainly .
egon , i would rather you did not mention any of this to peter if you do not mind .
i will not .
thank you .
i am not a doorman , miss barrett . i am a building superintendent .
you are also a human being , frank .
okay , okay . it is not my job , but what the hell . i will do you a favor . he takes the grocery bags from her .
thank you , frank . i will get the hang of this eventually .
that is a good looking kid you got there , ms . barrett .
thank you , frank . oh , are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom ? i asked you last week .
did not i do it ?
okay , that is no problem .
that is exactly what you said last week .
you know , dana , i am very very hurt that you did not call me first . i am still into all this stuff , you know . have not you ever seen my show ?
i have . that is why i did not call you first .
i can see that you are still very bitter about us , but in the interest of science , i am going to give it my best shot . let s go to work , boys .
he did not ditch me . we had some problems , he got a good offer from an orchestra in england and he took it .
he ditched you . you should have married me , you know .
you never asked me , and every time i brought it up you would get drowsy and fall asleep .
men are very sensitive , you know . we need to feel loved and desired , too .
well , when you started introducing me as the old ball and chain , that is when i left .
i may have a few personal problems but one thing i am is a total professional .
there s no doubt about it . he is got his father s looks . the kid is ugly extremely ugly . and smelly . you stink ! it is just horrible . you are the stinkiest baby i ever smelled . that is his name ?
his name is oscar .
oscar ! you poor kid !
peter , this is serious . i need to know if you think there s anything unusual about him .
unusual ? i do not know . i have not had a lot of experience with babies .
i will supervise .
we definitely had a moment or two .
okay , let s take a look .
you are personally responsible . if i can get conjugal rights , will you visit me at sing sing ?
please do not say that . you will not go to prison .
do not worry about me . i am like a cat .
you mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug ?
i am el gato . i always land on my feet .
good luck .
thanks .
oh , hello , peter .
you are really good , you know .
i did not paint it . i am just cleaning it . it is an original ver meer . it is worth about ten million dollars .
as a matter of fact , i stopped by to tell you that i have not forgotten your problem and that we are still on the case .
yeah , it is not the kind of thing you would want to hang in the rec room . you know what it needs ? a fluffy little white kitten in the corner .
good bye , peter .
i would like to stay , but i really do not have time to hang around here . i will call you . later , johnny !
no , i just got in a couple hours ago . come on in . are we having a pajama party ?
peter , the bathtub tried to eat oscar .
i must be losing my mind . at the museum today i could have sworn that terrible painting of vigo looked right at me .
who could blame him ? were you wearing this nightgown ?
i do not know what to do anymore .
i will get ray and egon to check out the bathtub . you better stay here .
peter , what about the bathtub ?
we will take care of that . ray , pete . listen , get over to dana s right away . . . her bathtub pulled a fast one tried to eat the kid .
it was full of this awful pink ooze .
sounds like another slime job . . . no , they are all right . they are here now . . . right . . . let me know .
peter , this is very nice , but you do not have to do any of this , you know .
really ? and how would we handle the sleeping arrangements ?
for me it is best if i sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me . if we go the other way i am afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night .
how about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby .
or we could do that .
thank you . poor baby . i think i should put him down now .
i will put him down for you . you are way too short ! and your belly button sticks out ! you are nothing but a burden to your poor mother !
yes , i am very clean . did they find anything at my apartment ?
now you get dressed and we go out . i got a babysitter and everything . trust me , you need it .
i am not here to date . i cannot leave oscar in a strange place with someone i do not know .
it is janine melnitz , from my staff . she is one of my most valuable employees .
does she know anything about babies ?
janine melnitz , are you kidding ? do i have a vase ? i brought some of your clothes . wear something intriguing . i brought along some interesting possibilities .
okay , but it is not a date . it is a dinner .
i put them in your hamper . i thought they were dirty .
i have a hamper ? next time ask me first , okay . i have more than two grades of laundry . there are lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty .
i want to stop getting involved with men who are not good for me .
does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow , or could you hold off for a few days maybe ?
for one night in your life , do you think it is possible for us to be completely real ?
all right , you want to be real ? so tell me why did you dump me ?
oh , peter , i did not dump you . i just had to protect myself . you really were not very good for me , you know .
i am not even good for me .
why do you say things like that ? you are so much better than you know .
thank you . if i had that kind of support on a daily basis , i could definitely shape up by the turn of the century .
so why do not you give me a jingle in the year ?
let me jingle you right now .
do not worry . janine has a very special way with children .
finally came to your senses , huh ?
same difference .
so what ? it is a free country . thanks , lib .
no problem . always glad to help and hug .
hi , egon .
a little to the left . right there ! that is where it stopped .
peter , do you think maybe i have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things .
maybe we should discuss this somewhere else .
valentine s day . that is got to be a bummer . where did you get that date , elaine ?
i received this information from an alien . i was at the paramus holiday inn , i was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking . then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that is where he told me about the end of the world .
your alien had a room in the holiday inn ?
it may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the holiday inn . i cannot be sure , peter .
no , you cannot , and i think that is the whole problem with aliens you just cannot trust them . you may get some nice ones occasionally like starman or e . t . , but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard . anyway , we are just about out of time . next week on world of the psychic , hairless pets . until then , this is peter venkman saying . . . . . . good night .
yeah , you can get your hand off my chest .
i am an old friend of the mayor s . i just want to say hello to him .
i know who you are , doctor venkman . busting any ghosts lately ?
no , that is what i want to talk to the mayor about . we did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued , screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you .
look , you stay away from the mayor . next fall , barring a disaster , he is going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends . you read me ?
yeah , i think the times might be interested , do not you ? the post might have a lot of fun with it , too .
now you are talking .
oh , you think so ? well , i have got news for you . you have got dracula s brother in law in there and he is got my girlfriend and her kid . around about midnight tonight , when you are partying uptown , this guy s going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants . and that is just round one .
it is that darn ghost again ! i do not know what to do anymore . he just will not leave us alone . i guess we will just have to move .
do not worry . we are not moving . he is .
ghostbusters .
what are you doing up here ?
i was trying to get that smelly green thing . the guys asked me to help out . i am like the fifth ghostbuster .
why would you want to be a ghostbuster if you are already an accountant ?
oh , no , it is just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt .
no , i celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is march first . that way i beat the crowds .
that is very practical . i hate going out on new year s eve , too .
janine , do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home ?
i would like to , but i told dr . venkman i would babysit . do you want to babysit with me ?
oh , sure , that sounds great .
so these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them .
it is really not a bad place . it just needs a womangs touch .
so they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services , which was a good deal for all of them because then they did not have to withhold tax and social security , which i am not saying is right but it is just a story , so i guess it is all right . i can finish this later if you are tired .
okay .
tonight ?
i do not think we should leave her alone .
you are right . we should stay .
oh , yeah , sure no . but there s really not much to do here and they might need some back up at the museum .
you are very brave , louis . good luck .
how are you ? that is that you are working on , johnny ?
too bad for the moldavians .

well , i would make an exception in this case if i were you .
my pleasure .
i know .
then why have you come ?
we got a major creep alert and we are just going down the list . your name was first .
the upper west side .
it must be the chemical fumes in the studio . people start imagining things
i am going to rule out the glue sniffing theory . if she says it looked at her , it looked at her . hey , you ! vigie ! look at me . i am talking to you . hey ! look at me when i am talking to you .
not . do not leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities . we will be back .
oh , johnny . did you back the wrong horse .
command me , lord .
on a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain , i sat on a throne of blood . what was will be , what is will be no more . now is the season of evil . find me a child that i might live again .
yes , the scourge
the sorrow of moldavia
the sorrow
i command you .
i await the word of vigo .
the season of evil begins with the birth of the new year . bring me the child that i might live again .
lord vigo , the mother , dana , is fine and strong . i was wondering well , would it be possible if i bring the baby , could i have the woman ?
so be it . on this the day of darkness , she will be ours , wife to you and mother to me .
sorry , your honor , but when somebody sets me up like that i cannot resist .
who are they ?
they are the scoleri brothers . i tried them for murder . they were electrocuted up at ossining in . now they want to kill me .
maybe they just want to appeal .
you have got to stop them . please !
okay , let me rephrase that question . did not you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children ?
do i ?
yes .
get on with it , counselor !
your honor , ladies and gentlemen of the audience . i do not think it is fair to call my clients frauds . okay , the blackout was a big problem for everybody . i was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and i had to go to the bathroom the whole time , but i do not blame them because once i turned into a dog and they helped me . thank you .
did i forget something ?
i cannot do it , louis . it is not ethical . i could lose my license .
why cannot you just have them released ? you are a doctor .
i am a dermatologist . i cannot write orders on the psych ward .
sherman , i have done lots of favors for you .
like what ?
i got you out of those bad tax shelters .
you were the one who got me in .
i fixed you up with diane troxler and she put out , did not she ?
yeah , i had to give her free dermabrasion for a year . forget it , louis . i could get in a lot of trouble .
i am telling you , we are all going to be in big trouble if we do not do something fast . that ghost guy came and took my friend s baby and we got to get it back . it is just a scared little baby , sherm .
then you should go to the police . i do not believe in any of that stuff .
hi , it is really great to meet you guys . i know this sounds weird but once i had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed , but i knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that
i thought you were like the fifth ghostbuster .
i let them handle all the little stuff . i just come in on the big ones .
well , i think it is important for people to know that the world is in danger .
okay , so can you tell us when it is going to happen or do we have to buy the book ?
i predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on new year s eve .
this year ? that is cutting it a little close , is not it ? i mean , just from a sales point of view , the book just came out , right ? so you are not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year . and it is going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie of the week or mini series potential . you would have been better off predicting or even just to be safe .
this is not just some money making scheme ! i did not just make up the date . i have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on new year s eve .
well , for your sake , i hope you are right . but i think my other guest may disagree with you . elaine , you had another date in mind ?
objection . irrelevant and immaterial .
seventy seventh and first avenue has so many holes already we did not think anyone would notice .
i had my fingers crossed when they swore me in , but i am going to tell you the truth . there are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding , things that cannot be explained and that most people do not want to know about anyway . that is where we come in .
so what are you saying ? that the world of the supernatural is your special province ?
no , i guess i am just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it .
hello , venkman .
how have you been ? how is teaching ? i bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours , huh ?
i think they are more interested in my epididymis .
i do not even want to know where that is .
yeah , you would . is that for personal or professional reasons ?
i think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street .
finding something abnormal on the street should not be too hard .
i knew that .
you need the exercise .
a hundred and five years ? he really hung on , did not he .
it is a rough translation from the moldavian .
roach breeding ? sounds better and better . dana ? the boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime . egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach breeding surge . should we forget about dinner and go with them instead ?
this will not wait until tomorrow , venkman . it is hot and it is ready to pop .
they love you , lib . keep it up .
i am worried . the vibrations could shake her to pieces . we should have padded her feet .
it is probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country .
from where neptune ?
they came from ostrov in eastern poland .
ostrov ? i have been there . good party town .
some crank . looking for goat hooves . come up with anything ?
this one s interesting . berlin , , a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground . three hundred eyewitnesses .
you might want to check those duke university mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis .
good idea .
why do not we try the giga meter ?
this is about as deep as you can go under manhattan without digging your own hole .
that is the reading ?
his nickname is the hammer .
it may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source .
and we are the . . .
this guy was a bad monkey . he dabbled in all the black arts , and listen to this prophecy . just before his head died , his last words were , death is but a door , time is but a window . i will be back .
that is it . it is on the bottom .
nine feet ten
butt out , you pencil necked geek . i have had it with you .
i cannot believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there s no way back . sure , it is crowded , it is dirty , it is noisy . and there are too many people who would just as soon step on your face as look at you . but there have got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned out burg . we just have to mobilize it .
we need something that everyone can get behind , a symbol
something good
do it ! just do it !
you mean this stuff actually feeds on bad vibes ?
i would put my money on that vigo character .
no , the slime is rising .
and it is all flowing toward the museum .
there s something very familiar about this painting .
oh , hiya , pete .
so , no goat hooves , huh ?
i knew that voice sounded familiar . that is up ? how is it going ?
nowhere fast . why do not you lock up and buy me a sub ?
uh , i cannot . i am kind of working on something .
oh , just checking something for an old friend .
who ?
who ? just someone we know .
oh , ray
aaah ! nobody ! i cannot tell you !
who , ray ?
dana ! dana barrett !
it is an interesting one , pete . if anything was going on it is totally subdued now .
egon and i have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in gevs giga electron volts .
hey , hey , hey , stresshound ! are you nuts ? if anybody found out about this we would be in serious trouble . the judge could not have been clearer no ghostbusting .
relax . we are going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet , low key , no profile .
okay , let s heat em up !
i am peter
hold on , ray ! half price ! have you gone crazy ?
i guess so , pete , because that is not all . tell them what else we have got , egon .
if he was not dead he would be an olympic prospect .
it is not that thing you do with your nostrils , is it ?
no , i am just restoring it to its normal state .
this is an incredible breakthrough , venkman . a psychoreactive substance ! whatever this is , it clearly responds to human emotional states .
mood slime . we ought to bottle this stuff and sell it .
we are running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction .
what kind of tests ?
well , we sing to it , we talk to it , we say supportive , nurturing things
you are not sleeping with this stuff , are you ?
nothing . just some mood slime residue in and around the bathtub . but we did turn up some interesting stuff on this vigo character you mentioned . i found the name vigo the carpathian in leon zundinger s magicians , martyrs and madmen . listen to this
i will get one more reading .
you just picked up three penalty points on your driver s license .
we are going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho reactive slime flow . we thought you might want to come along .
darn it ! i wish i would known you were going . i am stuck with these damn dinner reservations .
okay , but you are missing all the fun .
yeah , sorry i missed it . i guess you guys did not know about the dress code here . it is really kind of a coat and tie place .
it is all over the city , pete well , under it actually .
i hate jello .
good effort . now what ? should we say supportive , nurturing things to it , ray ?
only one way to find out . ready , teddy ?
are you kidding ? we will hit all that bridge traffic at th . i am going to take nd straight up to fifth . trust me , i used to drive a cab .
we are almost there , lib . step on it .
she is new in town .
the whole city s together on this one . we took a vote . everybody s down on you , you know .
yeah , and a lot easier to get to than that island .
oh , right , you told me that . they came to america seeking other kinds of cheese , as i recall . how about you , winston ?
me ? i am a little of everything . some irish , some german , some french , dutch the women in my family slept around . and that is what made this country great .
i am ready .
then let s do it .
come on , winston . we cannot quit now . the holidays are coming up . it is our best season .
ungrateful little yuppie larvae . after all we did for this city .
yeah , what did we do , ray ? the last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise .
yeah , but what a ride . you cannot make a hamburger without chopping up a cow .
it likes all the sappy stuff cumbaya , everything is beautiful , it is a small world but it loves jackie wilson .
i guess he was not too popular at the end there .
now if you do not want to be the fifth person ever to die in meta shock from a planar rift , i suggest you get down behind that desk and do not move until we give you the signal stabilize all clear .
huh ? what ?
you finished here ?
what ? yeah .
are you all right ? you coming down with something ?
no , i am fine . i just got light headed for a second there . let s go .
no , i just thought
well do not think !
yeah , i guess so . it was the strangest thing . i knew what i was doing but i could not stop . this really terrible feeling came over me and i do not know i just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all . whew ! sorry , boys .
look , zeddemore , it was not my fault you were too stupid to drop that line .
you better watch your mouth , man , or i will punch your lights out .
oh yeah ? anytime , anytime . just go ahead and try it .
do not you see ? it is the slime . that stuff is like pure , concentrated evil .
i have lived in new york all my life and i never visited the statue of liberty . now i finally get here and we are taking her out for a walk .
groovy . i have never felt better in my life .
right , and the first time someone gets mad , their toaster will eat their hand .
so we will put a warning on the label .
i do not think he is ready for the toaster .
you think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the s are true ?
and decent .
wonder what ?
if she is naked under that toga . she is french , you know .
it is okay . i have my senior lifesaving card .
miss blue blood ? her family s been here since the year .
i do not know . it probably would have been the same .
well , thanks a lot .
nice going , honey . it was brand new .
i did not break your precious clock , roy !
to the bathroom , where do you think ?
have i done the right thing ?
uuuuuuugh ! !
that is the matter , dear ?
it is a star ! that is great . you are very good .
ummm figure eight ?
incredible ! five for five . you are not cheating on me here , are you ?
no . they are just coming to me .
well , you are doing great . keep it up .
do you think i have it , dr . venkman ?
definitely . i think you may be a very gifted telepath .
eight o clock ?
i was just going to say eight . you are fantastic !
hi , louis .
. . . i thought it was the drug store .
are you sick , louis ?
no thanks , louis . i am really tired . i have been rehearsing all morning .
okay . i will take a raincheck . i always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods , but you know that . listen , that reminds me , i am having a party for all my clients . it is gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant . i know you fill out your own tax return , but i would like you to come being that you are my next door neighbor and all . . .
oh , that is nice , louis . i will stop by if i am around .
you know you should not leave your tv on so loud when you go out . that creep down the hall phoned the manager .
i thought i turned it off . i guess i forgot .
hi , louis .
hey , it is crazy in here . you are missing a classic party .
well , actually louis i have a friend coming by .
great ! bring her , too . but you better hurry . i made nachos with non fat cheese and they are almost gone . i will make some more though .
fine , louis . we will stop in for a drink .
i got the twister game for later . . .
i am zuul .
i am innocent ! honest , dana . i never touched you . not that i remember anyway .
all right , what happened to me ?
yes . . . well . . . i am not sure . what i have to say may sound a little . . . unusual .
we are all professionals here , miss . . .
barrett . dana barrett .
so what do you think it was ?
some people like the attention . some people are just crazy .
it is in the stars .
spengler , see if you can find the word zuul in any of the literature . i will take miss barrett home and check out her apartment .
no . if i moved out now i would be acknowledging that what happened was real . i am not ready to do that .
really ? do you have a favorite piece ?
i would have to say prokofiev s third concerto .
that is a violin concerto .
yeah , but it is got a great cello break .
no ? what do i act like ?
like a used car salesman .
thanks . that is in there ?
what ?
nothing . is that the kitchen ?
well , let s check it out .
i will wait here if you do not mind .
i told you , i . . .
i know . it happened by itself .
are you all right ?
yeah , yeah .
this is terrible . either there s a monster in my kitchen or i am completely crazy .
if it is any comfort to you , i do not think you are crazy .
thanks . coming from you that really means a lot to me .
i am a qualified psychologist . i have got a degree and everything . i believe that something happened here and i want to do something about it .
all right . what do you want to do ?
i think i should spend the night here .
that is it . get out .
on a purely scientific basis .
out !
i want to help you .
i will scream .
do not scream .
then leave .
okay , okay . but if anything else happens , you have to promise you will call me .
all right .
okay . then i will go .
goodbye .
no kiss ?
you heard it ?
you are the best one in your row .
most people cannot hear me with the whole orchestra playing . you are good .
i do not have to take abuse from you . i have other people dying to give it to me .
i know . you are quite a celebrity these days . are you here because you have info . . . about my case ?
who s the stiff ?
the stiff ? he happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man .
is he dying or something ?
yes , but i have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant .
cannot you tell me now ?
i will cancel the reservation , i found the name zuul in . . . the roylance guide to secret societies and sects . i do not suppose you have read it .
you must have gotten the last copy .
well , the name zuul refers to a demi god worshipped around b . c . by the . . . that is that say ?
hittites , the mesopotamians and the sumerians . zuul was the minion of gozer .
gozer he was very big in the sumerian religion . one of their gods .
that is he doing in my refrigerator .
i am checking on that . i think we should meet thursday night at nine to talk about it .
i do not think so . i am busy thursday night .
you think i enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients ? i am making an exception because i respect you as an artist and as a dresser .
all right . since you put it that way .
i will pick you up at your place . i will bring along the roylance guide we can read after we eat .
i have got to go now .
i am zuul . i am the gatekeeper .
okay , i will help you . should we make some dip or something ?
he is the destructor .
really ? cannot wait to meet him . as long as we are waiting for him , i would really like to try something with you in the bedroom .
well , i will just use it for a while and get it right back to you .
take me now .
i want you inside me .
i do not know . you have got two people in there already . it could get a little crowded . i want you to close your eyes and relax . now i am going to speak to dana and i want dana to answer .
i am zuul . i am . . .
right . . . you are the gatekeeper . but i want dana . dana , speak to me . . .
there is no dana . i am zuul .
whoa ! ! nice voice .
really ! is it gone ?
yeah , along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions . this one took some work .
thank you . next time i want to break a lease i will know who to call .
talk to my accountant .
no , we are moving you off campus . the board of regents has decided to terminate your grant . you are to vacate these premises immediately .
this is preposterous ! i demand an explanation .
fine . this university will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group s activities .
but why ? the students love us !
dr . venkman , we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind . you , however , seem to regard science as some kind of dodge or hustle . your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe , your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable . you are a poor scientist , dr . venkman , and you have no place in this department or in this university .
i see .
he is a big one . you do not want to mess with that particular breed .
definitely some sort of fighting spaniel , i think .
yeah , it is some kind of mallow type substance that is for sure .
you have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street .
i wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area .
that would definitely explain it .
yes . i am dr . venkman and this is dr . stantz .
thank you for coming . i would appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly .
one thing at a time . we do not even know what it is yet .
back off , man ! i am a scientist !
we will get back to you .
print is dead .
that is very fascinating to me . i read a lot myself . some people think i am too intellectual . but i think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time . i also play racketball . do you ever play ?
is that a game ?
it is a great game ! you should play sometime . i bet you would be good . you seem very athletic . do you have any hobbies ?
i collect spores , molds and fungus .
oh , that is very unusual .
i think it is the food of the future .
remind me not to go to lunch with you .
die in what sense ?
in the physical sense .
i do not care . i see us as tiny parts of a vast organism , like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void .
that is so romantic .
what is it ?
it is a souvenir from the world s fair at flushing meadow . it is my lucky coin .
i do not believe in luck .
keep it anyway . i have another one at home .
thank you .
what calls ?
here are tonight s calls .
the epa ? that is he want ?
i did not ask him . all i know is that i have not had a break in two weeks and you promised you would hire more help .
janine , i am sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry .
oh , really ? well , i have quit better jobs than this one , believe me .
has this ever happened before ?
well , most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor . . . the disturbances , i mean . . . but it is been quiet for years . . . up until two weeks ago . . . it was never ever this bad , though .
did you ever report it to anyone ?
heavens , no ! the owners do not like us to even talk about it . i hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight .
yes , sir . do not worry . we handle this kind of thing all the time .
i am walter peck . i represent the environmental protection agency , third district .
great ! how is it going ?
are you peter venkman ?
yes , i am doctor venkman .
i have ph . d s in psychology and parapsychology .
i see . and now you catch ghosts ?
you could say that .
and how many ghosts have you caught , mr . venkman ?
i am not at liberty to say .
and where do you put these ghosts once you catch them ?
in a storage facility .
and would this storage facility be located on these premises ?
yes , it would .
and may i see this storage facility ?
no , you may not .
and why not , mr . venkman ?
because you did not say the magic word .
and what is the magic word , mr . venkman ?
the magic word is please .
why do you want to see it ?
well , because i am curious . i want to know more about what you do here . frankly , there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation . for instance , the storage of noxious , possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement . now either you show me that is down there or i come back with a court order .
go ahead ! get a court order . then i am gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution .
have it your way , mr . venkman .
hey ! make yourself useful ! go save a tree !
forget it , venkman . you had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me . now it is my turn , smart ass .
see ! they are using drugs .
probably a mixture of gases , no doubt stolen from the army . . .
that is peck !
. . . or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really biblical proportions .
a square ?
good guess but no .
close but definitely wrong .
yes . i do not like this .
well , just more to go . that is this one ?
two wavy lines ?
sorry . this is not your day .
you volunteered , did not you ? are not we paying you for this ?
yeah , but i did not know you were going to give me electric shocks . what are you trying to prove ?
i am studying the effect of negative reinforcement on esp ability .
i will tell you the effect ! it pisses me off !
then my theory was correct .
they are not guns . they are particle throwers .
yeah , yeah . i just want to see em .
i could not do that . you might hurt someone .
on earth no . but on krypton we could slice him up like oscar mayer bologna .
wow !
were you recently in the bathroom ?
what on earth gave you that idea ?
the wet towels , residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair , the redness in your cheeks indicating . . .
you are a regular sherlock holmes . now what do you want ?
when you were in the bathroom , did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly ?
what have you got , egon ?
oh , this is big , peter . this is very big . there s definitely something here .
egon , somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head . do you remember that ?
i am always serious .
wow !
will you guys relax ? we are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade professional paranormal investigations and eliminations . the franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams .
she is telling the truth or at least she thinks she is .
did not see anything , did not get anything . nice girl no ghost . i am starting to worry . you said your graph was pointing to something big . you told me things were going to start popping .
yeah , i can smell it .
what ?
do not cross the beams .
why not ?
trust me . it will be bad .
what do you mean bad ?
it is hard to explain , but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension .
what is it ?
i am with dana barrett and she is floating three feet off the bed .
does she want to be ?
i do not think so . it is more of that gozer thing . she says she is the gatekeeper . does that make any sense to you ?
some . i just met the keymaster . he is here with me now . venkman ? are you there ?
yeah , yeah . i was just thinking . it probably would not be a good idea for them to get together at this point .
i agree .
you have to keep him there . do whatever you have to , but do not let him leave , he could be very dangerous .
i will spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning .
all right , peter . good night .
if you turn that thing off we will not be responsible for the consequences .
oh , shit !
let me guess gozer worshippers .
yes . after the first world war shandor decided that society was too sick to survive . and he was not alone . he had close to a thousand followers when he died . they conducted rituals , bizarre rituals , intended to bring about the end of the world .
she said he was the destructor .
who ?
gozer .
you talked to gozer ?
get a grip on yourself , egon . i talked to dana barrett and she referred to gozer as the destructor .
full stream with strogon pulse .
no ! them ! shoot them ! cross the beams .
life is just a state of mind .
but it is my favorite state .
or even a race memory , stored in the collective unconscious . and i would not rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either .
i blame myself .
we would better adjust our streams .
god , it is ugly !
easy . . . easy . . . i am going to throw in my trap now .
neutronize . system shut .
i need two new purge valves . how is the grid around the storage facility holding up ?
i am worried , ray . it is getting crowded in there . and all my recent data points to something big on the bottom .
the storage facility blew . this one . . . . . . shut off the protection grid .
and look at this , peter cold riveted girders with selenium cores .
that appears to be the case .
peter , at this afternoon at the main branch of the new york public library on fifth avenue , ten people witnessed a free roaming , vaporous , full torso apparition . it blew books from shelves at twenty feet away . scared the socks off some poor librarian .
sure . that is great , ray . i think you should get down there right away and check it out . let me know what happens .
no , this one s for real , peter . spengler went down there and took some pke readings . right off the top of the scale . buried the needle . we are close this time . i can feel it .
ray , as your friend i have to tell you i think you have really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff . you have been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the five boroughs who thinks he is had an experience . and what have you seen ?
what do you mean by seen ?
looked at with your eyes .
well , i was at an unexplained multiple high altitude rockfall once .
uh huh . i have heard about the rockfall , ray . i think you have been spending too much time with spengler .
it looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly .
what do we do now ?
i do not know . talk to it .
what do i say ?
anything ! just make contact .
hey , lady ? lady ! can you talk ? who are you ? this is not working . think of something else .
okay . okay . i got it . i know what to do . stay close . i have a plan .
i guess i got a little overexcited . was not it incredible ! i am telling you , this is a first . you know what this could mean to the university ?
oh , yeah . this could be bigger than the microchip . they will probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us . we are probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady .
if anyone deserves it , it is spengler and me . we are doing all the hard research and designing the equipment .
yeah , but i introduced you guys . you never would have met if not for me . that is got to be worth something .
ray , i apologize . i guess my confidence in the regents was misplaced . they did this to galileo , too .
you are always so worried about your reputation . we do not need the university . einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk . they cannot stop progress .
do you know what a patent clerk makes ? i liked the university . they gave us money , they gave us the facilities and we did not have to produce anything ! i have worked in the private sector . they expect results . you have never been out of college . you do not know what it is like out there .
let me tell you , ray , everything in life happens for a reason . call it fate , call it luck , karma , whatever . i think we were destined to get kicked out of there .
for what purpose ?
to go into business for ourselves .
my parents left me that house , i was born there .
you are not going to lose the house . everybody has three mortgages these days .
but at nineteen percent interest ! you did not even bargain with the guy .
maybe . but no one ever advertised before .
this might do . . . i do not know . . . it just seems kind of pricey for a fixer upper , do not you think ? we are trying to keep our costs down . you know how it is when you are starting a new company .
do you think it is wide enough ? how much ?
fourteen hundred .
good idea . were any other words spoken that you remember ?
it was not a date . it was an investigation .
do you know when that might be ? we are on the brink of a very serious cash flow problem .
no sense worrying about it now .
sure . each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back . no problem .
so far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a puerto rican bellboy .
all right . let s cool the negative vibes . these things can sense them .
where are you , pete ?
third floor . get down here ,
sit tight . i am on my way .
well , hurry up . the needle s going wild .
do not move . it will not hurt you .
how do you know ?
i do not know . i am just guessing .
i cannot take much more of this . the pace is killing me .
it is not good , pete .
no ! nobody ever built them like this ! the architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius . the whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy .
who was the architect ?
he is listed on the blueprints as i . shandor .
i do not think it is shandor .
well , that ought to do it .
forget the trapping ! just blast him !
what ? what popped in there ?
look !
the stay puft marshmallow man ! he was on all the packages we used to buy when i was a kid . we used to roast stay puft marshmallows at camp waconda !
great ! the marshmallows are about to get their revenge .
yeah , i heard that . now tell me what you really do .
uh . . . oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in dana barrett s apartment building . . . and they are most unusual .
are you a christian , ray ?
mmmhmmm .
me , too .
boy ! solid cores of shielded selenium . .
do you believe in god ?
no . but i liked jesus style .
me , too . parts of the bible are great .
the whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium tungsten alloy .
ray , do you remember something in the bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves ?
and the seas would boil . . .
right . and the sky would fall . . .
judgement day . . .
yeah , judgement day .
every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world .
well , has it ever occurred to you that the reason you have been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves ?
right . we will believe anything .
later , man ! !
what do you mean choose ? we do not understand .
we are nearly there , lucilla .
that is what you told me two days ago !
will you please get back in your wagon ? and stay there ?
i am tired of being stuck in that wagon .
i was suddenly thinking about going to bed .
oh , stay . . . do not you want to join the chorus of praises for narcissus glory ? just remember , he is a married man .
and caesar ! let s not forget to serve caesar !
why ? then they will notice when i am gone . well . i am making a public appearance are not i ?
maybe you should get married . pick one of your cousins , it would demonstrate a profound stability .
if you get me pregnant with a boy he will be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne .
i am sure , i do not know .
let some time pass . . . then ask , quietly , without anyone knowing it comes from me .
i want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house ! if it is worth something then sell it !
commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father . except that he cannot heave out his ghost .
if i may be so bold . . .
for the gods , spit it out !
why not do it in the colosseum ?
you cannot do that ! you came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you .
you are coming back ?
i have to come back . if i do not come back the people will think i am a coward . tribuus , tomorrow he dies i want his blood on the sand . do you understand ?
taking my pleasure . do i need to clear my lovers with you ?
you must start clearing everything with me especially your lovers .
why are you so surly you have won , brother . the people have bread and the city is quiet .
what is that . . . wailing ?
the fans of narcissus . they were on vigil outside the school of proximo . they believe he is dying .
what are you talking about ?
now that we are done with that infatuation forever .
if i ever loved narcissus it was not like you want .
but i get what i want , always , do not i ?
yes ? go on !
. . . by the emperor of rome . this writer asks between a senate that debates truth until they choke , an emperor who has the birth sign of a woman , is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without ?
you cannot do that . . . listen to the mood of the crowd .
i want that bastard dead !
you want control of the crowd you cannot get it by killing their hero .
i am their hero !
not yet , dear brother . . .
send them out !
do you want posters , too ?
you would have had a full scale revolt on your hands .
what have i got now ? it is exactly as if there were two emperors . because of this the people have two minds . he is their champion .
respectfully caesar , quintus and i must report .
of course , but not now . however , if he continues to be unwell , you may report to me .
that is difficult to say , general .
perhaps , master galen , you may say .
gladly caesar .
or perhaps into a new one . but here s to your god and the courage of our legions . . .
oh , but with the army behind you , you could become extremely political . not a republican by any chance ?
the dangerous man , caesar , is the man who does not care .
do we really need to repair this fort ? it seems like an expensive undertaking . i propose we burn it to the ground . that way if the germans cross the danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position .
you flatter me , caesar .
being as close , i am certain you have noticed what we all have noticed .
caesar ?
that this illness has clouded his mind .
we have to stop the germans now !
they will not break this one .
apparently my opinion was not needed .
cooperate and they will be returned to your estate . i could have executed you .
and my army would have thrown your body into the danube .
on what charge ?
if you set me free i will find my way back to the army , march on rome and depose you . then , the army and i will restore the republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again .
quintus will tell the army that you are being called to rome to celebrate your victory . they will hear that you are living in luxury . he will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life . and soon the army will not even remember your name .
how can they ? who else is there ? i have no heir . . .
ignore that ? ! the sooner we leave this disgusting place the better .
at least stay for the running of the animals . you are paying for it you know . . .
until your confirmation date .
at the opening of the month of janus , i will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship . . .
yes . you know , that is not a bad idea .
maybe it will crush gaius .
i am serious .
so am i .
we can crush gaius another way . what if you do throw something to the people they really want ? make them a gift of food .
give away food ?
sacks of grain , even bread . i own the grain licenses for the military , i can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the danube .
take grain away from the army ?
make a gift to the people . it is your money anyway so it is only fair .
i would not know who to bet on .
i am certain father will be in better humors by then . now , honor us with your presence at dinner . i will join you as soon as i see my father s physician .
he left us at dawn .
i met with falco , and the senators have agreed to call for a truce with the germans .
narcissus will never support you , caesar , he has too much of a philosophical temperament .
underdog ! how can he be an underdog he wins all the time ! i am the emperor why cannot i kill him ? he could be poisoned , or somehow killed to look like an accident .
you do not want to kill him . if anything happens to him now you will be blamed . . . and he knows it . besides , that gladiator school is a fortress . it would take the army to break in there . what you want is to . . . offer him the wooden sword . if he takes it , he is no longer the champion of the people , is he ? he is gone . and you are a hero for awarding it .
where is the emperor and the army , soldier ?
he must have been . he was on the list of prisoners to be executed .
caesar , i did my best . the colosseum is not under my control . . .
jerses tomorrow . . .
yes , caesar .
we need more statues perhaps i should open medical clinics . for the poor . citizens only , though . . .
this is cos , this precocious young man . a scribe for the daily action . i have invited him to write a small piece about you . . .
i am mentioning you in tomorrow s athlete s section , legate . so , i would love to know your birth sign it effects how people bet . and perhaps you could tell me a bit about . . . well , who are you ?
commodus . . . he is a gladiator . . . is he mad ?
i do not know . . .
agh ! please ! he is having a secret device constructed for the circus . the brass craftsmen are working overtime .
i will nose around . . .
you know there were riots last night . now the unrest has started again and commodus has sent for an army division . you understand what you are doing . . .
that is their job , is not it ? to argue . so , i think my case will be long on talk and short on action .
i am prepared to write anything you tell me .
the exact month when the emperor must be confirmed !
that makes his birth sign . . . virgo ! why that is the sign of a little girl ! can you tell my readers more about your star crossed connection with emperor commodus ?
proximo , we need to talk about my one third . . . i imagine the betting booths will be doing good business . and , what was the name of that olive oil company ?
yes , because i know they will read it .
god of passages and changes ?
i believe we are arriving in an enlightened age an age of peace that will bring rome her greatest glory . thanks to marcus aurelius .
you know , general , there is a gate of janus in rome which is only closed in time of peace . sadly , it has remained open for three hundred years .
i have read of it .
but have never been ?
my only visits to rome , senator , have been through books . but the war s over , time to close the door of war once and for all .
yes ! the days of imperial prerogative and disdain for the senate are over thanks to your father ! now report to the senate , master galen what is marcus state ?
the trouble is defining exactly what right is .
we all know what right is , senator .
the moment you returned from the battle your options were clear . if you are a friend to neither side , legate , you must be an enemy to both . we needed to know what you believed .
i hope you live to see what i believe . . .
you are hearing about somebody else .
how did you get condemned to the arena without a trial ?
when the senate and the emperor agree miracles can happen .
would you support the senate if they would give you a trial ? you would have to give me your word .
i need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing ?
you are a citizen and a soldier . not a gladiator .
you do not know how wrong you are .
why you ?
my loyalties . . . were in doubt .
fools to let us both live we will be our own best witnesses at our trial .
that is what worries me . . .
they cannot . . . if this is rome . . .
narcissus ! terrified ? you ? the only thing he is scared of is me .
only from a distance .
sneaking around with your brother ?
without him . he would be weeping if he overheard that . well ? the idea of you as my adopted brother is very . . . exciting .
i am not fit for the job and as a matter of fact i am not taking the job .
why do you keep playing at being so humble ? it is a little embarrassing .
why do you play at being drunk ?
how do you know i am playing ? well , the clown is always harmless . is not that right ? and how did you ever get to know me so well ? the last we spent any time together i was fourteen . i think you know me better than my father . he is going to die , is not he ?
i do not believe that . he is got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron . you know we are preparing for a full blown invasion of germany .
of course i know who do you think is paying for it ? the emperor himself , did not you know ? why do you think commodus came rushing up to the front ? burning patriotism ? filial love ? he wants to be sure when he takes over there s enough cash left in the treasury to . . . play emperor . watch out for him , narcissus he is inexperienced , but . . . be careful .
yours will do !
you mean a symbol of someone who does not exist .
but you do exist . narcissus hero of the battle of the danube .
for the sake of the gods , you are not leading these men ? how like my father you are . you believe . . . i guess that is why you are still alive .
do you remember your epictetus , that little homily we recited when we were children ? the one that was supposed to remind us we were romans ?
but what if i wish to be purple ?
would that marcus had lived .
marcus would have lived but . . . was poisoned by his son .
he killed his father and then my family . . .
narcissus , i have your family . they are alive . all of them .
hidden . where my brother cannot place hands on them . he did not have the guts to watch them die so . . . i took care of it all . the sooner he is put out of our misery , the sooner will they be safe .
the fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they are most vulnerable .
commodus listen to narcissus , listen to the man who has never lost a battle for rome ! you are young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple !
i will , marcus . but you are going to be well enough to direct it yourself .
i have made so many mistakes , narcissus . we all put off the very last duties of our lives because we are afraid of admitting when our lives are over .
there s no reason to say that . everyone knows you are going to be well . i had servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light .
servis made it through again ?
he is like you , sir , too tough for the gods to swallow .
commodus is just a young man , he will learn what you had to learn .
it is not because he is young , it is because he is ignorant and arrogant . his sister is a better man . that is why i have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the senate .
so i understand .
everyone talking about it ? i would not wonder . all i seek is a genuine balance of power between the emperor and the senate . thus i have transferred legal power which was theirs to begin with back to the senators . this includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan . it is a start , only a start . if the emperor and the senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share . this means commodus has to bend does he strike you as that type ?
you are too hard on him . he is a strong young man , with you as his guide . . .
a man should be upright , not be kept upright . history shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute . i want you to consider becoming my heir .
marcus , you honor me , but i am a soldier , politics scare the hell out of me .
the senators admire you .
they fear me .
they fear change . the new caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible . you could be the one , the emperor , the man who oversees the rebirth of the republic .
i will do anything in my power to help you restore the republic but i cannot be that power .
much more colorful than the ones we wear . and , of course , less dented .
tomorrow ?
as soon as i can .
on your honor as a roman officer , daddy ?
on my honor as your daddy . . .
let s hope he does not start giving orders .
what the hell do you think it was about ? there s nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others .
why do not we try to keep politics out of the conversation .
well , we can try . . .
centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the germans will try one last offensive . they have got nothing to lose and it is so very like them .
what deal ?
rome is going to pay an allotment to the german tribes on an annual basis .
my troops do not make policy .
well , they die for it !
i cannot let you do that .
i was summoned .
it is your job as a roman officer to disobey such a summons .
it is my job to keep my job . and that , by the way , is now head of praetorian guard . good ole tribuus has been retired .
quintus , you have got at least a division with you we could take rome away from commodus and give it back to the senate !
you seem to be doing a great job of it single hand ! narcissus , the republic is dead . you think those senators could govern ? for the last hundred and fifty years they have worked hard at kissing an endless succession of imperial asses !
then give the empire back to the people . . . the children who will grow up to become senators . . .
the people ? , listen to the people , they know what they want a government that gives them what they need and does not bother them with messy thoughts of issues . you know , messy . . . thinking . they want a dictator ! as far as the children , there is only one thing that every roman child dreams of being you ! a famous gladiator !
can you stop that slaughter ? ! can you free these men ?
is not the helmet magnificent ?
greeks ?
athenians . . .
they are studying with cynics .
of course . . .
i can see that . . .
the battle is over . the war is over . you have won !
if you win , you know , you have to stay . it is the losers who get to go home . besides , i am not so sure it is over . centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines .
i have been overseeing production myself for the past three years , you will be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become .
who else ? i am the one who runs the estates while you are here risking everything we have for the glory of rome ! or for the glory of you !
i am a soldier we are at war . i cannot stay home tending the damned olive groves ?
we do not need your help we are doing great on our own .
let him trust quintus .
quintus is overly idealistic .
i never knew a more idealistic man than you .
me ? well , i believe in rome . . . you would have to after what i have seen , how people outside the empire treat each other .
i do not even want to imagine the things you have seen . . .
what you do not want to imagine is the things i have done .
no !
how long do you think commodus will let us live once he is in power ? a month ? half a year ? paestum will be a prison where he will hold us until it is time . . .
narcissus !
do you want to see themis and manto butchered ? if i die fighting commodus he will not care about you . if i live i will come and get you .
i do not want you to die !
your daughters need more than some vapors they need you !
they will have me . teach them . do not let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history , without philosophy , without meaning . teach them of the greeks , the babylonians , the hebrews , the numidians , the egyptians and the great romans . teach them , who we are !
you teach them !
that is what i am going to do . that is what i am going to do . . .
i killed too many barbarians .
i am a greek , thank you . and i was brought up believing romans were the barbarians . give our new colleague some of the cretan white . relax , tell me everything , i am your friend .
i am the man who might save your life give you a bit more life at any rate . i am proximo palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me . i own this school and everything that is in it . you are in it ! but why ? what did a roman general do to get himself condemned to the colosseum ? understand , we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets . please , i separated you from the others because . . . . . . my nose tells me you have been condemned for important reasons .
condemned ? are not i owed a trial before being condemned ?
general , all i know is you have been condemned to the colosseum , and a trial is nowhere to be seen .
impossible ! every citizen has a right to trial this is rome !
you are to be killed , exactly . they will give you a sporting chance , but just enough to make your murder . . . entertaining . romans like to mix their metaphors laughter with their executions , you know ? if you survive , though , you will become a gladiator . a gladiator at least gets a fair fight .
death is a very light thing for you .
death is . . . everything for me . now you have to go to your cell , and i to dicker with jerses . . . you will be fed well . i want you to be fit as you can be i want you to win for me tomorrow ! i want all my gladiators to win and be happy ! besides , i have never owned a roman general before .
chain him .
i refuse to be your slave . i refuse
to fight ? we will see . . .
i am not a gladiator . i refuse to fight .
then , you will die . . . just , know this because you asked i asked i am sorry but . . .
i did not get killed and everyone else did .
that is one way to look at it .
what would the poster say narcissus would kill for a taste of golden pompeii olive oil ?
think about it ! just think about it !
alive . . . i am alive . . .
do not be ridiculous .
lucky it did not step on his head .
make us rich , proximo , make us very rich . . .
what the hell are you talking about , greek ?
so i pretend i am dead . you get gold , what do i get ?
you get to come alive again in the country !
as , what , the galloping gladiator ? !
the point is you get to fight the easy country circuit , the small arenas , relax , live the good life !
spend my days beheading country bumpkins ? i do not know , proximo , who has better wine than you ? besides , i am beginning to think of the colosseum as my home .
but you have to go out there ! i will give you more than your one third ! when i get paid . . . just take the fall ! you are too hurt to fight and the mangs a killer !
pressures on , eh proximo ? there s got to be a load of money in this . why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window ?
it is absolutely not like that ! this is for your own good ! come on get the rest of your armor on !
on you ! of course ! you are my bravest fighter the best fighter i have ever seen !
such nobility from such an ignoble mouth . take my advice and make that bet .
oh , shit . take your time ! do not get suckered ! this man is a murderer ! in his career he is killed over a thousand gladiators . please , just take the fall !
a great deal . they designed and build tiger s chariot . . .
they want to dump tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot , right ? they do not waste time . . .
i can really rape them on this ! can i at least tell them you will think about it ?
no . tell them i will do it . but i want more posters all over rome .
fantastic ! wonderful ! but posters are very expensive .
then get a large cash advance .
right , right . . . but they will have to bring in a lawyer . i do not want to get sued over this .
before they leave , get gold .
right , right , what am i thinking of ?
i want another interview with cos . tell him to bring plenty of ink .
i will do it ! sure as there s shit in the tiber we are all going to die , but for you anything !
you were a soldier , and then a gladiator , were not you ?
was i ?
i want nothing to do with the arena .
something else , then . do the chariot races interest you ?
are you mad ? with all this unrest the colosseum will be open day and night ! anyway , i am not political , i am in the entertainment business .
hello .
yes .
do you know what you are going to do ?
no .
are you going to graduate school ?
no .
yes .
i would love some .
no .
why not ?
if it is all right with you , i am not hungry .
no why should i ?
i do not know .
no .
i am sorry i took you in there .
i think i would better go home now please .
but , elaine
where is the car ?
i just want to tell you something .
but could i just tell you this one thing ?
what ?
this whole idea this date and everything . it was my parents idea . they forced me into it .
oh that is very nice of you to tell me .
no . what i mean is that is why i have been acting this way . i am not like this . i hate myself like this .
no , i could not .
but could you try ?
no .
yes , i do .
no , i mean i would not want to wake anyone up .
we will not . let s go inside .
wait a minute .
is anything wrong ?
no i was just thinking look it is still early we could do something go somewhere else .

i am trying to think of where there s a place to have a drink around here .
is not there one in the taft hotel ?
nothing . i am just wondering if they have a bar or not . i mean let s go see . let s go see if they do or not .
of course there is . look the veranda room right there .
let s get out of here , elaine . let s go somewhere else .
benjamin do they know you ?
of course not .
i do not know . they must think i look like this guy gladstone .
yes .
you are the first you are the first thing for so long that i have liked . the first person i could stand to be with .
it just happened . it was just this thing that happened along with everything else . can you understand that ?
yes .
with a family ?
yes . she had a husband and a son .
did they ever find out ?
no .
and it is all over now .
yes .
i am glad .
during the day ? we will go for a drive or something .

oh no , mrs . robinson , oh no .
that is wrong ?
mrs . robinson , you did not i mean you did not expect

what do you think ?
well i do not know .
for god s sake , mrs . robinson , here we are , you have got me into your house . you give me a drink . you put on music , now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband will not be home for hours .

mrs . robinson you are trying to seduce me .
why no . i had not thought of it . i feel rather flattered that you
mrs . robinson , will you forgive me for what i just said ?
it is all right .
it is not all right , it is the worst thing i have ever said to anyone .
sit down .
please forgive me . because i like you . i do not think of you that way . but i am mixed up .
all right . now finish your drink .
mrs . robinson , it makes me sick that i said that to you .

benjamin you have known me all your life .
i know that . but i am

then why do you keep running away ?
because you are going to bed . i do not think i should be up here .
yes , i have
what if he did ?
well , it would look pretty funny , would not it ?
do not you think he trusts us together ?
of course he does . but he might get the wrong idea . anyone might .
i do not see why . i am twice as old as you are . how could anyone think
but they would ! do not you see ?
benjamin i am not trying to seduce you . i wish you would
i know that . but please , mrs . robinson . this is difficult for me .
why is it ?
because i am confused about things . i cannot tell what i am imagining . i cannot tell that is real . i cannot
would you like me to seduce you ?
what ?
is that what you are trying to tell me ?
i am going home now . i apologize for what i said . i hope you can forget it . but i am going home right now .

mrs . robinson i cannot do this .

this is all terribly wrong .
benjamin do you find me undesirable ?
oh no , mrs . robinson . i think i think you are the most attractive of all my parents friends . i just do not think we could possibly

no but look maybe we could do something else together , mrs . robinson would you like to go to a movie .
benjamin , is this your first time ?
is this what ?
it is , is not it ? it is your first time .
that is a laugh , mrs . robinson . that is really a laugh . ha ha .
you can admit that , cannot you ?
are you kidding ?
it is nothing to be ashamed of
wait a minute !
on your first time
who said it was my first time ?
that you are afraid
wait a minute .
of bring inadequate i mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way
inadequate !
if you want .
good . i mean are we dead or something ?
well i just do not think we have much to say to each other .
all we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together .
are you tired of it ?
i am not . no . but do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then ?
well what do you want to talk about ?
anything . anything at all .
do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences ?
oh my god .
well ?
mrs . robinson . if that is the best we can do let s just get the goddamn clothes off and
how about art .
art . that is a good subject . you start it off .
you start it off . i do not know anything about it .
oh .
do not you ?
yes i do . i know quite a bit about it .
go ahead then .
art . well what do you want to know about it .
neither .
you are not interested in art ?
no .
then why do you want to talk about it ?
i do not .
no . think of another topic . tell me what you did today .
do you really want me to ?
yes i do .
i got up .
yes . but you might try and spice it up with a little originality .
i got up . i ate breakfast and went shopping . during the afternoon i read a novel .
what one .
what ?
what novel did you read .
i do not remember .
there !
what ?
your husband ! mrs . robinson ! there s something we could have a conversation about .
him ?
i mean everything . i do not know anything about how you how you work this . i do not know how you get out of the house at night . i do not know the risk involved .
there is not any .
there s no risk ?
i walk out .
you walk right out the door .
he is asleep .
always ?
benjamin , this is not a very interesting topic .
please . now tell me . how do you know he will not wake up sometime and follow you .
because he takes sleeping pills . he takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o clock .
but what about the noise from the car . what if
the driveway s on my side of the house .
we are talking .
what ?
we are talking , mrs . robinson . we are talking .
calm down , benjamin .
now let s keep going here .
can i undress and talk at the same time ?
right .
thank you .
now . you say the driveway s on your side of the house . so i guess you do not sleep in the same room .
we do not .
so you do not i mean i do not like to seem like i am prying but i guess you do not sleep together or anything .
no we do not .
well how long has this been going on .
about five years .
oh no . are you kidding me ?
no .
you have not slept with your husband for five years ?
now and then . he gets drunk a few times a year .
how many times a year .
on new year s eve . sometimes on his birthday .
man , is this interesting .
is it ?
so you do not love him . you would not say you
we have talked enough , benjamin .
wait a minute . so you would not say you loved him .
not exactly .
but you do not hate him .
no , benjamin . i do not hate him . unhook my blouse .
well how do you feel about him , then ?
i do not .
well that is kind of a bad situation then , is not it ?
is it ?
i mean it does not sound like it could be much worse . if you hated him at least you would hate him .
no .
what ?
i never did , benjamin . now let s
well , wait a minute . you married him .
see if you can guess .
well i cannot .
think real hard , benjamin .
i cannot see why you did , unless . . . you did not have to marry him or anything , did you ?
do not tell elaine .
oh no . you had to marry him because you got pregnant ?
are you shocked ?
well i never thought of you and mr . robinson as the kind of people who . . .
all right . now let s get to bed .
wait a minute . wait a minute . so how did it happen ?
what ?
i mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances ?
not particularly .
was he a law student at the time ?
yes .
at college .
yes .
what was your major ?
why are you asking me all this ?
because i am interested , mrs . robinson . now what was your major subject at college ?
art .
art ?
kind of .
well how did it happen ?
how do you think .
i mean did he take you up to his room with him ? did you go to a hotel ?
benjamin , what does it possibly matter ?
i am curious .
we would go to his car .
oh no . in the car you did it ?
i do not think we were the first .
what ?
do you remember the make of the car ?
oh my god .
really . i want to know .
it was a ford , benjamin .
a ford ! a ford ! goddamnit , a ford ! that is great !
that is enough .
so old elaine robinson got started in a ford .
do not talk about elaine ?
no .
why not ?
because i do not want you to .
there s nothing to tell .
well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden ?
benjamin , do not you ever take that girl out .
well look . i have no intention of taking her out .
good .
i was just kidding around .
good .
but why should not i ?
i have my reasons .
then let s hear them .
no .
let s hear your reasons , mrs . robinson . because i think i know what they are .
let s drop it .
we are not dropping it . now that is the reason , is not it ? i am a dirty degenerate , are not i ? i am not fit to
benjamin ?
i am good enough for you but i am too slimy to associate with your daughter . that is it , is not it ? is not it ?
yes .
you go to hell . you go straight to hell , mrs . robinson . do you think i am proud of myself ? do you think i am proud of this ?
i would not know .
well , i am not .
you are not .
no sir . i am not proud that i spend my time with a broken down alcoholic !
i see .
and if you think i come here for any reason besides pure boredom , then you are all wrong .
are you ?
you are goddamn right i am .
now do not start this .
what ?
do not start acting hurt .
do not you expect me to be a little hurt ?
mrs . robinson , you stand there and tell me i am not good enough for your daughter .
did i say that ?
of course you did .
well two minutes ago you told me i was not good enough for your daughter . now you say you are sorry i got that impression .
i did not mean it . i do not think you would be right for each other . but i would never say you were not as good a person as she is .
you would not .
of course i would not .
well it is pretty obvious you do not want me around any more .
well look i was kind of upset there . i am sorry i said those things .
if that is how you feel
but it is not .
that is all right . i think i can understand why i am disgusting to you .
oh no . look i like you . i would not keep coming here if i did not like you .
but if it is sickening for you
it is not ! i enjoy it ! i look forward to it . it is the one thing i have to look forward to .
you do not have to say that .
well i would not . i would never say it if it was not true .
may i stay then ?
yes . please . i want you to .
thank you .
well do not thank me , because i want you to .
then give me your word you will not .
this is absurd .
promise me , benjamin .
all right , for christ s sake . i promise i will never take out elaine robinson .
thank you . benjamin
let s not talk about it . let s not talk at all .
benjamin i thought i made myself perfectly clear about this .
look , we will go out to dinner and have a drink and i will bring her back . because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families . and i am afraid i could not quite handle that , if you do not mind . i have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life . so do not get upset about it .
but i am . i am extremely upset about it , benjamin .
mrs . robinson i have a date with elaine . we are going for a drive .
do exactly what i say .
listen to me very carefully , benjamin . you are not to see elaine again . ever . those are my orders . is that clear ?
i can makes things quite unpleasant .
how ?
in order to keep elaine away from you i am prepared to tell her everything .
i do not believe you .
then you would better start believing me .
mrs . robinson , do not wreck it . i am asking you please not to wreck it .
go home now .
i just do not believe you would do that .
where is elaine ?
i will be with you in a moment , benjamin . will you send a police car to twelve hundred glenview road . we have a burgler here . just a second . i will ask him . are you armed ? no i do not believe he is . thank you .
i think we have everything quite under control now , benjamin . would you like a quick drink before you go ?
i am sorry we will not be able to invite you to the wedding , benjamin , but the arrangements have been so rushed
what the hell have you done ?
i will find her .
i do not think so .
sir ?
the toothbrush . i got it all right .
very good , sir .
yes . well goodnight .
goodnight , sir .
i would like you to know my sister , miss dewitte
yes , but i am afraid
i will find your table in a moment . braddock . not braniff ? we have a braniff .
no actually i am just looking for a friend .
i am afraid i do not understand .
i am not with your party i am sorry .
hey i do not get it .
hello , mrs . robinson .
sure .
benjamin ? i am going to ask you something but you do not have to tell me if you do not want .
what ?
well i am going to ask you what you do when you go off at night .
when i go off ?
you do not have to tell me if you do not want .
no , i do . i want to tell you .
what else ?
nothing else .
well you do not drive around from midnight until noon the next day , benjamin .
oh , no .
then what do you do ? do you meet someone ?
meet someone ?
well this is your business , benjamin . if you
no wait . wait .
benjamin , i am not going to pry into your affairs , but i would rather you did not say anything at all than be dishonest . goodnight , benjamin .
well , wait .
because i know you do not drive around for twelve hours .
oh . well , i do not . shall i tell you what i do ?
not if you do not want to .
i do .
but i do not want you to make up something .
i am not . but i am i am not very proud of what i do . i usually get kind of drunk . i usually drive over to los angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk . then i take a hotel room . so i will not have to drive home on the freeway . i mean it kind of scares me to drive home after
goodnight , benjamin .
you believe me , do not you ?
no .
you do not ?
goodnight .
next time he suggests it , i will tell him i have no intention of ever calling her up in my life .
i do .
then i will simply invite all the robinsons over for dinner on thursday .
oh , ben this is so exciting
no they do not .
well when did you decide all this ?
about an hour ago .
we have not .
worried ?
well
about what ?
i guess about my future .
what about it ?
i do not know . i want it to be
to be what ?
different .
well it is very comfortable just to drift here .
have you thought about graduate school ?
no .
would you mind telling me then what were those four years of college for ? what was the point of all that hard work ?
you got me .
now listen , ben . i think it is a very good thing that a young man after he is done some very good work should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself , and lie around , and drink beer and so on . but after a few weeks i believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass .
look elaine robinson and i do not get along .
how do you know ? you have not seen her since high school . i guess your evenings , whatever you do with them , are just too valuable .
that has nothing to do with it
i guess i will just tell mr . robinson that you are just too busy every evening doing god knows what
i am going to marry elaine robinson .
no . i think you will want to wait on that .
no . she does not know about it .
she does not know that you are coming up to berkeley ?
no . actually she does not know about us getting married yet .
no it is not . it is completely baked . it is a decision i have made .
swell . i appreciate it .
she is upstairs . she wanted me to wait down here till you got home .
standing guard over the old castle , are you ?
yes , sir .
oh no .
what ?
i have got to go .
is anything wrong ? you look a little shaken up .
no . no i am just i am just a little worried about my future . i am a little upset about my future .
ben how old are you now ?
twenty . i will be twenty one next week .
that is a hell of a good age to be .
thank you .
i wish i was that age again . because , ben
sir ?
you will never be young again .
i know .
ben , can i say something to you ?
what ?
how long have we known each other now ?
quite a while .
i have watched you grow up , ben .
yes , sir .
in many ways i feel as though you were my own son .
thank you .
so i hope you will not mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice .
i would like to hear it .
ben i think i think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to .
oh no .
what ? you look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off . does not he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off ?
oh yes .
ben i want you to give her a call .
i will .
great .
oh not too much . taking it easy .
that is what i would do if i could . nothing wrong with that . hey ben , elaine s coming down from berkeley soon . i want you to call her up this time .
i will .
because i just think you two would hit it off real well together .
what would you say to a short one ? bourbon still your drink ?
yes .
mr . robinson ?
do you have a special grudge against me ? do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me ?
no , it is not
is there something i have said that is caused this contempt ? or is it just the things i stand for that you despise ?
it was nothing to do with you , sir .
well , ben , it was quite a bit to do with me .
ben , i think we are two civilized human beings . do you think it is necessary to threaten each other ?
i am not threatening you .
do you want to unclench your fists , please ? thank you . i can see in the dark , you know . i have been here quite a while .
i am trying to tell you i have no personal feelings about you , mr . robinson . i am trying to tell you i do not resent you .
you do not respect me terribly much either , do you ?
no , i do not .
well , i do not think we have a whole lot to say to each other , ben . i do think you should know the consequences of what you have done . i do think you should know that my wife and i are getting a divorce soon .
but why ?
why ?
it should not make any difference what happened .
that is quite a statement .
listen to me . we got we got into bed with each other . but it was nothing . it was nothing at all . we might we might just as well have been shaking hands .
shaking hands . well , that is not saying much for my wife , is it ?
you miss the point .
do not shout at me , ben .
the point is i do not love your wife . i love your daughter , sir .
well i am sure you think you do , ben , but after a few times in bed with elaine i feel quite sure you would get over that as quickly as you
huh ?
i think i have talked about this enough . i do not know how far i can go , ben . i do not know if i can prosecute or not , but i think maybe i can . in the light of that is happened i think maybe i can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again . i have seen elaine and i have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure . . .
mrs . robinson ?
yes ?
it is benjamin .
yes ?
benjamin braddock .
benjamin where are you ?
can you look through the glass .
yes , i can .
could i speak to you for a second , dad ?
twenty one years old , ladies and gentlemen four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nationgs leading seats of learning
i would like to discuss this .
this boy i am sorry this young man is soon to continue his education as a frank halpingham award scholar but before he does
dad can you listen
i will give you ten seconds . he is going to give us a practical demonstration of what i feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present and it better work or i am out over two hundred bucks so let s hear it for

no i told you not to come in this lobby .
time s getting short .
i have told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth .
not now .
yes , sir .
well ?

yes .
and what are you going to do ?
the pearls are in her room .

you have been waiting your chance . you are too much of a gentleman that is the trouble with you .
i told you i will get the pearls tonight .

why ?
the floor clerk is out there in the corridor she sees everything
i could take care of her .
how ?
chloroform on a handkerchief from behind while you . . .
no no no no . . .
why ?
poor girl chloroform would give her a rotten headache . . . i know i had it in the war . besides , she is very pretty not young but
you are no good for this business . it is just a joke to you . . .
i do not like your tone .
no
with the pearls ?
with the pearls
you cannot .
i am not going to get those pearls and neither are you .
what about the money ?
i will pay you back .
how ?
i have an idea working in my head . . .
you might find a bullet through that head . . .
if you did that , you would get nothing except the police after you . if you wait i will give you your six thousand back
not with strangers .
you are a fool !
yes , i am rather .

whoever is keeping you waiting .

i was so alone always alone and suddenly you were there and said that . no . i am not afraid . it is strange .
do not cry it tears my heart to see you sob like that .
nerves just nerves . you must forgive me . i have had a bad evening . i am very tired . do you know what it is to be tired tired of a routine existence ?
i am afraid not i usually do just what i feel like doing at the moment .
i would like to smoke a cigarette .
certainly .
i did not know you were so beautiful . . . and
and then ?
no irony . you are so appealing so soft so tired . i feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you ever .
and and

yes tired . . .
so alone .
alone . all alone . oh , you strange strange creature .
you must not talk russian to me .
strange man . . .
am i quite strange to you ?
not quite strange now . it is as if i had been expecting you . you know , once when the grand duke was alive , i found a man hiding in my room a young officer
and . . . ?
he disappeared . later he was found dead .
i never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a womangs room when she is alone .

exactly .
if the preysing people get the manchester contract , we shall certainly merge with the preysing company but if they have not they are ruined preysing will have to declare himself .

yes , mr . preysing that is what we want to know .
they turn out marvelous material in manchester .
manchester yes . yes , yes , they do . yes now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning ? have we cigars water and everything ?
we have a good many connections in england , naturally .
i mean with the manchester people ?
we are here to discuss our merger . naturally i can make no statement at this time . we must begin at the beginning .
all right .
since , on the eleventh of june , this year when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages .
i am laying before you the last general statement of our concern . active capital , plant and machinery , raw material and finished product for instance mop rags
mop rags !
oh preysing , preysing
no water what a place !
all you have to do is phone for it .
oh now let s talk like adults . you want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do . we know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it would not sound so good . when you first approached us . . .
we did not approach you .
scratched we did not take the initiative .
of course you took the initiative .
and i said we did not .
mop rags mop rags we are interested in something quite different !
what ?
you have decided against the merger ?
yes

yes
why talk it is over it is over it is finished . you have broken off negotiations . you did it . you are calling them off . you had nothing on your mind all day , but manchester , manchester manchester . you do not suppose for one moment that i am such a fool as not to have something that i could say definitely about manchester .
what ?
oh no no the session is over . let s go , it is off . thank you , gentlemen .
if you actually have news from manchester then . . .
gentlemen , i am now free to announce . . . . . . that the deal between my firm and the manchester cotton company has been successfully negotiated .
preysing , you are joking with us .
under these circumstances it is quite a different matter .
under these circumstances we might refuse to sign .
next week .
foggy frightfully foggy , always , i am told . have you said anything about manchester , mr . preysing ?
thank god we are beginning at the beginning .
as you remember it when you approached us . . .
we did not approach you .

you have talked enough today , you are hoarse now .

a person that do not look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else . he is a liability , right , bobo ?
you are a thousand percent right !
or else he is working an angle . if he does not steal a little , he is steeling big .
you know it , lilly .
you know , i like that suit , bobo . i do not know what there is about it , but it somehow makes you look taller .
yeah ? you really think so ? a lot of people been telling me the same thing .
well , you can tell them i said they are right . i better get going . roy will wonder where i am .
worries about his mother , eh ? give him a hug for me .
i will . so long , bobo .
roy ? he is always crying .
the kids beat him up , because his home life is , uh , different .
i like you , too .
hah .
good evening . i would like a single for tonight .
oh , everything s the same size , same price .
those trucks . i know exactly what you mean .
do you have something around back , facing away from the road ?
sounds perfect . i can park my car back there ?
right in front of the room .
fine .
no problem . my husband gets up the crack of dawn . it is his kidneys .
oh , i told mister hebbing all about it , how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients !
mary beth , i hope you are not spreading this good news too widely .
well , of course not ! i know how dangerous this is . but i would trust mister hebbing with anything . would not i , darling ?
goody !
mary beth ! this has never been anything but
oh , i know , i know , and you have been wonderful since i was widowed . but mister hebbing has you do not mind my telling him , darling suffered reverses . if he could . . .
so here we are !
mister hebbing , we are talking about breaking the law here , i want to be sure you understand that . no one gets hurt , but the law does get broken .
oh , henry , no , that is just boring .
we are not really interested , henry .
henry , no !
cannot move .
it is just the strain again , the stress . we will take a vacation .
it is all hollow . nothing behind it .
oh , cole , please . please come out of it . what would i do without you ?
and i do not just mean the sec . we could have the fbi breathing down our necks .
i certainly hope not .
loose talk is the one thing i worry about .
i can keep my mouth shut , mister fellowes .
one of those computer geniuses , is not it ?
you are right ! and this boy tapped into that main link between tokyo and the new york stock exchange . he can give us , when it is really useful , a seven second delay in that movement of information . do you know what that means ?
every once in a while , a major change comes through . we have seven seconds to take advantage , put our buy order , our sell order , into the computer in new york before the tokyo data comes in .
not much time .
we have to be ready . we have to have the money , and we have to know what the information means , and we have to move immediately .
seven seconds . i do not see how you do it .
these machines they are in here .
i must admit , mister fellowes , i had moments i was worried .
you brought a case ? good .
what ? he is going to be all right !
mrs . dillon , your son was in some sort of accident . he is had an internal hemorrhage , he is bleeding to death inside .
well , make it stop !
his blood pressure is under a hundred . i do not think he will live to get to the hospital .
you know who i work for .
my son will be all right . if he is not , i will have you killed .
delmar ? i never go out to california . that is a thousand miles from here .
nine hundred . bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time . come on , lilly , you do not argue with bobo .
i know .
take two , three days . call when you get there .
maybe i will swing around los ang gleez on the way .
why ? that is wrong ?
you are a valued customer , as you know .
but that is wrong ?
i cannot understand a thing like this . it is something you almost never see .
what is ?
this is some of the finest filigreed platinum i have ever seen . but the stones , no . they are not diamonds , mrs . langtry .
but they must be ! they cut glass !
glass will cut glass , mrs . langtry . do you know where it was purchased ?
why , of course it is . i can offer you well , five hundred dollars .
i will get you a check .
it is not your fault .
you will give us an opportunity to serve you again , i hope . if there s anything you think we might be interested in . . .
i have only one thing now . are you interested ?
well , i would have to see it , of course .
you are seeing it . you are looking right at it .
hello .
roy dillon .
i know that . knew it when i saw you out there . the best salesman here , which is not saying much . want to talk to you , dillon .
that was a pretty backhanded compliment . if i let people get away with things like that , i would not be a good salesman .
you are right . i apologize . but i still want to talk to you .
lead on .
so i heard .
makes no difference to me if they are only on commission . if they do not make good money , they are not giving us good representation , and we cannot afford to have them around . ever supervise salesmen ?
just myself .
that is right , you have had to supervise yourself . this place needs a sales manager . somebody who s proved he is a salesman and can handle other salesmen . he would have a lot of deadwood to clear out , new men to hire . what do you think ?
i do not know offhand what your best year s been , we can look it up . the idea is , we will top it by fifteen percent .
that is just the first year . if you are not worth a lot more than that the second year , i will kick you out . what do you say ?
well , uh . . . no .
no ?
i cannot take that job ! i mean , i mean , i cannot take it right away . i am still recuperating , i just dropped in to say hello , see everybody
i did not realize . yeah , you do look a little pale . how soon will you be ready ? a week ?
but you need a man right now . it would not be fair to you to
i take care of the being fair to me department . things have gone to hell this long , they can go a little longer .
well . . .
oh , sure . fine .
perk .
mr . kaggs , i am sorry .
you are turning me down ? makes no sense , roy .
i guess i am just not a leader of men .
oh , come on , roy .
the truth is , mr . kaggs
perk , remember ?
okay , fine . perk , the truth is , i like things the way they are now . pick my own hours , have time for , uh , other activities . . .
a well rounded life . i respect that . but it has to have a center , roy , something you care about , something you can think about .
maybe i am just not ready for that yet .
well , roy , if that is the way you feel , i will not badger you . do not want to lose you as a salesman , too .
oh , i would like to stay on . just keep everything the way it was .
that is what we will do , then . but i tell you what , roy . before i hire anybody else , i will ask you one last time . fair enough ?
fair enough .
they twisted my arm .
only one arm ?
only one tooth ?
i am working down in san diego . just for a few weeks . thought i would drop in on my long lost son .
nice to see you . what am i doing in here ?
thanks , uh , lilly .
do not mention it .
i guess i owe you my life .
you always did .
just a little accident . i went by your place , picked up your mall . just bills , i will take care of them .
i can take care of my own bills , lilly .
whatever you say . the manager says your boss called . really pulled the wool over everybody s eyes , huh ?
what are you talking about ? so i have got a job . so what ?
stop kidding me ! four years in a town like los ang gleez , and a peanut selling job is the best you can do ? you expect me to believe that ?
it is there . the boss called , you said so yourself .
and that dump you live in ! those clown pictures on the walls !
you do not ! roy dillon ? cornball clown pictures ? commission salesman ? it is all a front , is not it ? you are on the grift , i know you are . you are working some angle , and do not tell me you are not because i wrote the book !
you are one to talk . still running playback money for the mob .
that is me . that is who i am . you were never cut out for the rackets , roy , and if you
how come ?
no . and you have to be .
my boss is a guy named bobo justus , back in baltimore . when a long shot gets too much action , i have to put money on that horse at the track , because it is the only way to get the odds down .
sure .
the first day of the delmar meet , there was a nag called bluebell . i should have been on it . but that was the day after you came in here , so i stuck around to see how you were gonna be .
bluebell came in ?
i sent bobo ten grand of my own money , like it was the winnings from my bets . i hoped that would cover me . it did not .
he let me live . he let me be his friend .
you do if you are where i am . where you want to be . how would you get that punch in the stomach , roy ?
get off the grift , roy .
why ?
you do not have the stomach for it .
that is right .
myra and me come down to lajolla for the weekend .
we will not hit the track . the beach . couple a nice restaurants .
four grand . for the hospital . is that enough ?
roy , i do not want money from you .
i pay my debts .
you do ?
no . that was the point .
no can do . have to dip in and out of my bag too much . besides , it will heal in the air .
i guess not . you will be heading east from here , huh ?
after the meet . back to baltimore .
well . . . nice to see you again , lilly .
you , too , roy .
well , that is good news .
somewhere else , that is for sure .
i just came back from phoenix .
oh , yeah ? is the frame holding ?
looks very solid , lilly . sit down . take a minute , tell me about it .
i have really got to
you are dead , lilly , it worked .
not for long . not when they do a fingerprint check .
why should they ? the cops are satisfied .
bobo will not be . he will spend the money to make sure .
even so . you still got time . relax a minute , tell me what happened . sit down .
she must have been the one that blew me off with bobo . i guess to get me running . did you tell her about my stash ?
no .
no , you would not . that is what she was after , though . but why hit on me ?
i would not go in on a deal with her . she blamed you for it .
as though you do what i say .
that is pretty funny , all right . what happened in phoenix ?
this way s perfect .
you have already made a start . does not look that clean , though .
do not be sorry . you are not taking it .
you must have some money .
just a few bucks .
and myra s stuff ?
her credit cards . how far am i gonna get with that ?
far enough . maybe up to san francisco . or st . louis , someplace new . start over .
at what ?
you are smart , lilly , and you are good looking . you will not have any trouble finding a job .
a job ? i have never had a legit job in my life !
well , you are gonna start , if you hope to live through this . a square job and a quiet life . you start showing up at the track or the hot spots and bobo s boys will be all over you .
roy , i know what to do with myself ! it is a big world out there .
not any more . lilly , listen , i am giving you good advice . i am following it myself .
what ?
i thought it over , and you were right . you wanted me out of the rackets , and now
roy , that is fine , but i do not have time for this . bobo
i thought you would be happy for me . after all , you
bobo is not after you ! bobo s after me , and he is goddamn good ! but so am i . i am a survivor , roy . i survive .
i know you do , so that is why
and to survive , my way , i need money . bobo knows about the stash in the car , so i did not dare touch it , not if lilly dillongs dead . so that leaves this .
no .
i do not think so . you probably should not either .
no , but i am goddamn thirsty . ice water ?
yeah , sure , that sounds nice .
i will get it .
oh , you will live , lilly .
oh ? i did not know anything was .
oh , really ? you have got a legitimate complaint , roy , i do not deny that . i was not a very good mother when you were a kid .
not very good !
uh huh .
i wonder did you ever think about it from my side .
never .
no , i guess not . it was pretty lousy of me , i guess , to be a child at the same time you were . not to stop being a child just because i had a child . i guess i was a real stinker not to be a grown up when you needed a grown up .
and making you feel bad at the same time , huh ? but that is the way i am , you know , the way i have always been . always picking on poor little roy .
for god s sake , lilly !
i gave you your life twice . i am asking you to give me mine once . i need the money .
no .
that is right .
that is good . you do not really belong on this side of the fence , you know .
i do not ?
if you stayed a crook , do you think you would live to be my ripe age ?
i do not see why not .
well , i guess i got it wrong , then . seems to me i heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him .
sure , sure , that does not count . that is different .
well , it does not matter , does it ? i am getting out .
and that is why you have got to get rid of this money . if you keep it around , it will just make you think how clever you are . it will be a temptation to get back into the game .
oh , that is it ! you are stealing my money for my own good ! how very motherly of you , lilly .
a future . the only future i have got .
that money would not last forever . and then what ? you would be back in some other part of the rackets . another bobo justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands . this way , you have got to go the square route . you could send me a card when you are settled , i could maybe help out sometimes . . .
that is what it is , is not it ? keep me down . your turn to be in charge , have the power .
just trying to help , lilly .
what ?
i have to have that money , roy . what do i have to do to get it ?
is there nothing i can do , roy , nothing at
no !
i do not care about that . this time , i gotta have the rent .
it is not the owner , myra , it is my wife . she knows that is going on . this time , i gotta have the money .
joe , you know you will
my wife sent me here , myra . for the money . she is waiting .
i will have it tonight . nine o clock ? ten ?
this time . . .
we will work something out , joe .
you taught me a lot . then i invented .
scram . go home .
i cannot . i just left home .
you are too young . you should be in school .
i am in school .
in your other hand .
always , for you , baby .
taking you for granite ?
are you sure ?
let s find out .
mm ?
look at me .
oh , i am , baby , believe me .
roy ? it this all we have ?
all ? it ai not bad .
no more than this ?
i did not say that . you are not marriage material .
no , baby . come to mama .
you called the doctor , huh ?
well , no , roy . your mother found you .
oh , yeah ? thanks . how long do they say i am in here ?
i want to know everything about you .
you do . and once i am out of here , i will remind you of the best parts .
i just do what the doctor says , babe .
you are just comfortable , that is all . you do not even ask to go home . you just lie around , let your mama take care of you .
mama !
who else is paying for all this ? you badmouth the woman all the time , but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you .
i will pay lilly back , do not you worry about that .
i do not like to come here , roy . every time i do , your mother comes in and makes remarks .
that is just lilly s way .
and you never defend me . you are afraid of her .
oh , do not be stupid .
you are a mama s boy , if you want the truth .
every day in every way .
i will see you when you get home .
because it is comfortable .
we will rent a car .
you ai not seen nothin .
see you soon .
i will sign that affidavit .
great to get away , take it easy . next week , i will get back to work .
you already went back to work .
what ?
i watched you . working the tap on those soldier boys .
working the what ?
oh , come on , roy .
i am a salesman .
you are on the grift . same as me .
myra , i am not following this .
roy , you are a short con operator . and a good one , i think . do not talk to me like i am another square .
the long end . big con .
nobody does that single o .
i was teamed ten years with the best in the business . cole langley .
i have heard the name .
it was beautiful . and getting better all the time .
is that right ?
it is , roy ! and now , right now , it is the perfect time , the best time since i have been in the game .
and when he got serious ?
he would explain he had to have cash , so there would not be any paper trail for the sec . and a lot of cash , or it was not worth while . the least we ever took was forty thousand , and the most was one hundred eighty five thousand dollars ! from one sucker !
i thought these people were broke .
no , no , roy , just cash poor . they had savings accounts , stocks to sell , houses to mortgage . sell their wife s jewelry . oh , they had a lot of money , when they put their minds to it . or when i put their minds to it . i stayed with them , that is the roper s job , made them get up every penny they could raise , turn it all over to cole .
and a month later , the sucker calls the cops and you are on the run .
no no ! he never calls the cops , not after we give him the blow off .
yeah ? how ?
what happened to cole ?
he retired .
where ?
upstate .
upstate where ?
atascadero .
that is where they keep the criminally insane , is not it ?
join up with you ! i watched you , roy , i have been watching you , wondering if i should talk about this at all , or maybe just . . .
take a hike , you mean ?
i need a partner , roy . i need an inside man , and you are it . you could be as wonderful as cole .
i do not know , myra , i never had partners . i never needed them .
not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks . but how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand ?
sure .
separate bathrooms , darling . i will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over .
things a man is not supposed to know .
you do not mind , really , do you , roy ? it is been such a wonderful evening , i guess i just wore myself out .
sure . i am pretty tired myself .
open your door .
what ? what for ?
open it and find out .
if you could have seen your face when i told you good night ! you looked so , so . . . ah !
oh , come here .
i went out to delmar .
the track ? did you run into lilly ?
i saw her .
she did not see you , in other words .
i am not trying to make trouble , roy . it is just , she is always so nasty to me , i thought , who is she to be so high and mighty . i saw her out there , and i called a friend of mine in baltimore , so now i know who she is .
you must have some very knowledgeable friends .
i am well connected , roy , cole introduced me to a lot of people . very valuable . valuable for us .
running your broker scam , you mean .
you and me , roy . what a team we will make . we think alike we get along together . once or twice a year we take some slob , the rest of the time we live like this . you will not regret this , roy .
regret what ? i did not say i was coming aboard .
but why not ? i thought it was settled . that is holding you back ?
come on , myra , do not talk business here . this is time out .
yes or no . they are both easier at home . okay ?
i called a fellow i know in tulsa , the one who plays my chauffeur . there s a sucker there he says is made for us . and a boroker that just shut down , we can use their office , not change a thing ! now , i can scrape up ten grand without much trouble . that leaves fifteen or twenty for your end . we could start this weekend , get the sucker into position
wait a minute ! when did this happen , that we are partners ?
what ?
the last i looked , we were just talking things over .
but the setup s there . it is there now .
i do not think i need it .
you are too good for the small time , roy . move up to where there s big dough to be made , and you do not have to stick your neck out every day .
maybe i like it where i am .
no ! because i
that is what i say .
what ?
what i say is , no . we do not do partners .
for christ s sake , why not ?
mostly , because you scare the shit out of me . i have seen people like you before , baby . double tough and sharp as they come , and you get what you want or else . but you do not make it work forever .
bullshit !
no history . sooner or later , the lightning hits . i do not want to be around when it hits you .
i am happy the way i am .
by god , it is your mother . it is lilly .
what ?
sure it is . that is why you act so funny around each other .
do not act so goddamned innocent ! you and your own mother , gah ! you like to go back where you been , huh ?
i am wise to you , i should have seen it before , you rotten son of a bitch . how is it , huh ? how do you like
yes ?
lieutenant pierson , phoenix police . i have a car here .
thank you .
well , mostly , i do not believe it .
that is natural .
no . i mean , i do not believe it . lilly is not a suicide . i know my mother , nothing would make her check out .
i am sorry , it was her all right . her gun , even .
gun ?
i grant you , it is a little odd , shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it , but it was hers , all right . it really is your mother , mister dillon .
it may be lilly , but it is not suicide .
do you have any particular reason to say that ?
my mother . . . well , i guess it does not matter now . she worked for gamblers . she always knew they might turn on her some day .
a hit , you mean . honestly , it does not have that feel to it , but i will certainly consider the possibility . thank you for telling me .
you up to it now ?
sure . let s get it over .
one thing i have to caution you about . a gunshot wound . . .
yes , i know , i know .
well , uh , you know , she ate the gun .
what ?
i am sorry , that is an unfortunate phrase , it slipped out , i am , to tell you the truth , mr . dillon , this is not an everyday occurrence around here .
ate the gun . oh .
someone who knows her well could still identify her , that is not the problem . it is just there s , uh , it is likely to be a shock .
well , let s get the shock over with .
not many .
no question , huh ?
no , its why did she ?
oh , yeah . that is that .
why yes , mr . dillon . here s a potential new neighbor , looking at
uh huh . mrs . langtry may drop by .
sickness comes to us all , mister dillon .
that is true , mr . simms .
we never know when and we never know why . we never know how . the only blessed thing we know is , it will be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time . just when you have got tickets to the world series . and that is the way the permanent waves .
well , i am back now . i just wanted you to know . gotta rush .
happy to see you looking so good .
it is for your cigarette . i prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants .
they said on the phone you were assigned to the meyers case .
with all due respect , detective , you cannot go blaming every brutal murder in illinois on michael meyers .
pamela whittington was a long time associate of dr . loomis . her home office was ransacked . it was chock full of loomis files on meyers . it would say that makes meyers a suspect , would not you ?
well , when you put it that way .
right . so why do not we get on with this investigation ?
i like a woman who takes control .
that do not match either of the victim s .
unable to escape , she turns and attacks the killer , but does not connect .
no blood on the knife .
broken blood vessels on her right forearm .
explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains . . .
girl scouts .
it is blake . meet me at grand view .
where ?
the cemetery . . .
yeah , alright . . . i will be there in ten .
only the real stiffs .
i can be real stiff .
charming .
care to join me ?
come on , carter . you know it is michael .
what do you want me to do , put out an a . p . b . on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone ?
yes .
sweet dreams , blake .
it is blake . how do you feel about wisconsin ?
the door was open , so we let ourselves in .
toni blake from langley p . d .
do i know you ?
i would prefer you did not . i am very busy .
okay , then how about we ask you a few questions ?
detective . . .
carter .
. . . i think it would be best if you both left .
might want to stop and think about the safety of your students , miss tate .
i never stop thinking about it , detective . the only way in or out of this school is through that gate , and it is secured at all times .
funny , we just drove right in .
well , i can assure you , it will not happen again . thanks for your concern . goodbye .
better take em to virgil s downtown . we got a dead body in there .
it is amy kramer .
my god . . .
pretty messy . parents have already been notified . our office has been trying to get a hold of you . . .
well , eddie catero did not show up for work this morning . . . parents say he never came home last night . car s still missing .
think eddie had something to do with it ?
does not look good .
what the fuck are you talking about ?
michael meyers never used a meat cleaver . it was a butcher knife .
who are you , the serial killer police ? what difference does it make ?
it is not historically accurate , that is all .
would somebody shut this guy up ?
my blood pleasure . you scared the hell out of me .
oh . sorry . i am on my way to the ring and
i think someone broke into my house .
no shit ? !
no shit .
checking out your place .
no . wait for the police .
and miss the big game ? no way .
you sure ?
totally . i checked all the rooms and closets . . .
nothing s missing ?
do not think so . but they sure did a real number on your office . crap everywhere .
my office ?
yeah . oh , and they messed up your kitchen pretty good , too . . . goodnight .
you are so predictable .
betcha did not predict that .
and i should have a son who calls me mom . looks like we are both shit out of luck .
okay , you win . i will call you mom . now can i move into the dorms ?
no .
you are father thinks it is okay to run off to cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top . somehow his opinion does not count .
i promise not to run off to cancun .
forget it .
the dorms are only fifty feet away . you could practically see into my window . so , what difference does it make ?
my point exactly . see , we both agree .
i took the padlock off your door . what more do you want ?
my life is a living hell .
to the bathroom . can i do that alone or do you want to watch ?
i thought you would never ask .
i know .
nothing .
you are kidding with that answer , right ?
i just went for a walk . it is no big deal .
wrong . there are rules in this house and you are going to follow them whether you like it or not .
or what ? you are gonna shoot me ?
it is an option .
well , maybe if you would let me live in the dorms , i would not have to sneak out to spend time with my friends .
oh , so now it is my fault ?
just forget it . . .
will , sit down . . .
i was trying to get away from someone .
afraid not . you can pick your friends , but you cannot pick your family .
yes .
any other psychotic relatives i should know about ? jason ? freddy krueger ?
no .
why did not you tell me ?
i was trying to protect you from this . . .
i do not know .
get on the bus .
where is molly ? she is not in her room . . .
just get on the bus .
i am not leaving without her .
john , you cannot help her now .
what ? where is she ?
john . . .
please , get on the bus . . .
call me laurie , will ya ?
keri . . . . laurie . . . how about if i just call you mom ?
that would work .
where would you get it ?
swiped it from my mom s desk yesterday .
you stole it ?
i borrowed it .
why not ?
i cannot afford to get caught .
is that all you guys can think about ? amy never came back last night . maybe she is in trouble .
i came to see you .
i can see that . why ?
can i come in ?
are you crazy ? you will get caught .
then you come out here .
then i will get caught .
well , i am not going until i talk to you .
alright . i will come out . just be quiet .
you saw that michael meyers display . you have got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that .
i guess . it is just hard to believe .
i am okay .
here , take my jacket .
yeah .
i know . i am really , really sorry , miss tate . please let me keep the job . . . it is the only way i can afford to stay here .
okay , tell you what . . . you can still be the school r . a . , but no dance tomorrow night .
okay . . . thank you .
who ? !
michael meyers !
looks great . it does .
you okay ? you seem a little off .
nothing a good stiff drink cannot fix .
it is always john .
still wants to move out ?

we can light our own tree at home .
guess so . . .
then they can watch .
answer what ?
what if it is kara ?
the voice man ! he is here !
the kids at school said this is a haunted house that a bad man used to live here .
they did , did they ? since when did we start listening to the kids at school ?
but i have seen him !
you have been watching too much tv .
he says things . bad things .
like what ?
okay . . . but just for tonight .
you cannot expect us to stay here
danny , you are just going to have to wait !
there s nothing to be scared of , baby . it is just another storm . try to get some sleep .
i cannot . the voice man is coming to get me .
no one s coming to get you . not while i am around .
promise ?
i promise .
danny ! ! !
relax , john . they were just kids .
kids are that is ruining this country . everywhere you go , it is the same . no goddamn respect .
you will never pass that exam on an empty stomach , kara .
a man came by the house . a psychiatrist by the name of loomis .
what the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without
john , they sound jamie lloyd this morning ! someone tried to kill her !
what in god s name are you talking about , woman ? when are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows ?
i am getting the children out of here . at least until we know what we are dealing with . john , i want you to come with us .
debra , you are fucking insane .
you knew , did not you , john ? you knew .
who are you ?
i have come to help your family .
what makes you think he will come here again ?
this house is sacred to him . it is the source of his memories his rage . mrs . strode , i beg you . do not let your family suffer the same fast as laurie and her daughter .
jamie ? but i thought she was
found this morning . in a field outside haddonfield . stabbed .
lock the doors and call your husband . get your family as far away from haddonfield as possible .
god . . . this cannot be true .
mrs . strode , michael myers is here to kill his family . and he will not stop until you are all destroyed . i only thank god that i found you before he did .
no please listen ! they are coming . . . coming for me and my baby .
it is . . . michael . . . . . . michael myers !
no , please listen ! they are coming . . . coming for me and my baby .
come on , sweetheart what is this ? who s coming ?
it is . . . michael . . . michael myers !
danny , go downstairs now !
i did not he got in a fight and i
you stay away from him !
him .
here . let me try .
why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby ?
not just kyle . all of you . his entire family . here . look at this .
it is a rune . . . thorn .
black magic . . . in ancient times , thorn was believed to cause sickness , famine and death . translated literally , it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices . . . on the celtic celebration of samhain .
halloween .
when applied directly to another person , thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction to literally visit them with the devil .
to find the rest of your family before michael myers does or whoever s been controlling him .
mrs . blankenship , have you seen the little boy who came in with me and
he is gone .
kara , no !
wait a minute . . .
it is not working !
that is the whole idea of living in the country . i thrive on the seclusion .
i hope you did not come all the way out here in this storm just to quote freud .
as always , your keen powers of perception astound me . and you are right . i have come to celebrate . after thirty two years as psychiatric administrator , guess who has been named smith s groves new chief of staff .
but surely rogers is not
retiring .
you should know that it is not wise to play halloween pranks on me .
you are the only man for the job , sam . things have not been the same since you left . i am recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country . old colleagues . this is your change to finally make a difference .
please try to understand , terence . i have already made up my mind .
you do not know that for sure . it could have been anyone . a practical joke . kids .
it was jamie lloyd . she came back , as i knew she would one day . and whatever has brought her back has brought michael back as well .
after six years ? sam , she died with him in that explosion after the
that is what someone wants us to believe , but i tell you michael is alive . i feel him . i sense the evil that lives inside , just as i did all those years as i watched him . sitting behind these very same walls . staring . growing stronger . as my colleague , as my friend , please . i cannot go through this again . not alone . i need your help to stop him .
or that is left of him .
it is a sign . he is come home .
i am here now , jamie . you are going to live . you have to .
an old friend .
any word on the location of the strodes ?
no one s home . checked it out myself .
good . i want around the clock surveillance on that house .
i will meet you over there .
sam , you know you never fail to amaze me . yesterday happily retired , today right back in the thick of things . somehow i knew you still had it in you .
this is madness , wynn .
your madness is another mangs greatness . this is the way things have always been . you have just been too blinded by your own reality to see . but having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways . you always did come through our loyal watch dog . finding him . bringing him back to us once he would finished his work . although after you had that nasty stroke the last time , i had to go after him myself . and what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell .
it was you .
sometimes a cigar is just a cigar .
why did you take jamie ?
she has the gift the blood of thorn running through her veins . michael s mother had it , too . so for six years i incubated her , prepared her for this night . michael has served his purpose . and soon we will have a new progeny .
jamie s baby . . .
there you go trying to make sense again . it is a curse . handed down through countless generations . as ageless as this celebration which you call halloween .
samhain .
and i am its deliverer . its calling card , if you will . i follow it . protect it . act as its guardian . in a sense , sam , so do you .
amazing , is not it ? i even taught him to drive .
stay away , sam .
leave the boy . take me .
dr . loomis , thank god you are here . you heard her , did not you ? it was jamie .
i am sorry , but do i know you
i am tommy . tommy doyle . laurie strode jamie s mother she was baby sitting for me that night
please just tell me the truth . has michael myers come home ?
i know he is alive . people in this town they want us to believe he is dead . but i know . i have always known .
right now at least one girl is dead and jamie lloyd is in there fighting for her life . she is the last of his blood line . if she dies
no , dr . loomis . she is not the last night .
no one .
no there had to be someone else . who knew ? !
only me and dr . wynn .
no ! ! !
i dunno , boy .
hm ?
it is a bitch .
a bitch .
did not recognize you .
we have never met .
i wonder who will recognize us first ? they will wet their pants .
i hope the men do . i would rather the women did not .
i am gonna wet my pants .
one thing , anyway at least penelope did not throw out all your crap . i bet alice threw out all my crap after i would been gone a week .
we will see .
home . jesus . i am like this . home !
home is important to a man .
you know what gets me ?
no .
how all the magazines show tits today .
um .
used to be against the law , did not it ?
i suppose .
must have changed that law .
you know what gets me ?
oh , shit .
how everybody says fuck and shit all the time . i used to be scared shitless i would say fuck or shit in public , by accident . now everybody says fuck and shit , fuck and shit all the time . something very big must have happened while we were out of the country .
looseleaf will you get the hell home ?
at least we found the diamonds .
at least !
i would really feel stupid if we did not bring anything back home .
it is enough that you have brought yourself home !
i wish you would tell alice that . and that goddamn mrs . wheeler .
tell them yourself !
you do not know my mother in law , boy .
after eight years in the jungle with you , i know mrs . wheeler better than i know anybody in the universe !
i did not tell you everything .
the time we were in a tree for fourteen days , you certainly tried to tell me everything about mrs . wheeler .
i did not even scratch the surface . you are lucky , boy . you come home , and nobody s here . when i go home , everybody s going to be there .
this room is full of ghosts .
you are lucky , boy . my house is gonna be filled with people .
go home !
thank god we found the fucking diamonds !
the hell with the diamonds !
you were rich before . this is the first time i was ever rich .
go home ! show them how rich you are for a change !
can i have the cadillac ?
take the cadillac and drive it off a cliff , for all i care .
what will you do for transportation ?
i will buy a hundred more cadillacs . go home !
you know what gets me about that cadillac ?
go home !
when i drive it , i feel like i am in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum . i do not hear anything , i do not feel anything . i figure somebody else is driving . it is a bitch .
go home .
i am liable to find anything !
that is the point ! walk in there and find whatever there is to find before alice can cover it up .
i know , i know . i dunno . at least she is in the same house . sure was spooky , looking in the window there , and there she was .
so long , colonel .
you know what gets me ?
let s talk about it some other time .
how short the skirts are .
good night , colonel . it is been beautiful .
something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone .
leave me alone ! after eight years of horrendously close association , the time has come to part ! i crave solitude and time for reflection and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood . you and i may not meet again for months !
months ?
i am certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow , and i will not welcome your horning back into mine . a chapter has ended . we are old comrades at a parting of the ways .
i am lonesome already .
go home !
you ever own a motorcycle ?
you are right ! we will take a trip . a trip is what we will take . i do not want to talk about motorcycles . i do not want to talk about tits . go home !
have not got one .
let s talk about something else .
i sure did not expect her to drop dead .
first nagasaki now this .
how about breakfast , wife ?
the educational process .
i guess . you are lucky you do not have any old people around here .
she was about to get married again . she locked me out of the bedroom last night .
you know me , boy .
one of them is the doctor , whose weapons are compassion , unselfishness , peacefulness maudlin concern .
huh .
he and his love are like a retiarius . do you know what a retiarius is ?
he is a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and does not wear anything but a jockstrap .
how do you know that ?
you told me .
when ?
when we were up in the tree so long with the bats .
oh . i would forgotten .
fourteen times you told me . i counted .
really ?
you would get this funny look in your eyes , and i would say to myself , oh , jesus he is going to tell me what a retiarius is again .
sorry .
of course ! not only go to it but go to it in full uniform ! rent a uniform !
that is against the law , is not it ? i cannot wear a uniform anymore .
wear your uniform and every decoration , and let them despise you , if they dare .
alice would be absolutely tear ass .
when i was a naive young recruit in spain , i used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings , shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos . i now understand it was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform uncontrollable fear . to our women .
i did not know we had any women left .
the world is teeming with women ours to enjoy .
every time i start thinking like that i get the clap .
it helped more than you know . down deep , people were deeply affected .
you keep on saying deep and deeply . i wish something good would happen on the surface sometime .
he is a man . tell him you are a man .
i dunno .
you are so low ! look at that beautiful red meat . you have not touched it .
sorry . at least you have got a place to come back to . i do not have a place to come back to anymore .
all the more reason to go to africa .
i dunno . you know . i used to really love that alice . do you know that ?
you know her for what she is now garbage .
i dunno .
she was always a rotten wife ! she was against everything manly you ever wanted to do . he was the most daring test pilot in the country at one time , and his wife made him quit . she made him become a life insurance salesman instead .
shut up , you ninny ! you were never to come here again for any reason whatsoever !
that is this ?
i would not want to be married to me . we are too crazy . you know ?
in what way , pray tell ?
i did not like that violin thing . that was sad .
tit for tat as simple as that .
you never played a violin .
you did ?
yeah . i practically forgot . but after you busted that thing , i got to thinking , jesus maybe i will start the violin again . that did not just belong to woodly . that belonged to everybody . maybe he would have sold it to me , and i could have some fun . after you busted the violin , boy , and penelope walked out , i thought to myself , jesus who could blame her ?
maybe it is time you got out .
me ?
you .
okay . okay .
you are an imbecile .
i know you think that .
everybody thinks that .
anybody who would drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb .
the one direct , decisive , intelligent act of your life !
i do not think so . it could have been .
if what ?
if i had not done it . if i would said to myself , screw it . i am going to let all those people down there live .
they were enemies . we were at war .
yeah , jesus but wars would be a lot better , i think , if guys would say to themselves sometimes , jesus i am not going to do that to the enemy . that is too much . you could have been the manufacturer of that violin there , even though you do not know how to make a violin , just by not busting it up . i could have been the father of all those people in nagasaki , and the mother , too , just by not dropping the bomb . i sent em to heaven instead and i do not think there is one .
goodbye , looseleaf .
how are you , honeybunch ?
is penelope in ?
the posies are for her ?
i wanted to apologize .
you have come to the right man .
i forgot my vacuum cleaner .
i forget mine for years on end .
oh my god and you are looseleaf harper .
our pleasure .
eight years you guys were together through thick and thin .
for seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged or we would have been home long before now , believe me . we were saved from starvation by the lupi loopo indians , who fed us a strange blue soup .
blue soup .
it sapped our will made us peaceful and unenterprising . it was a form of chemical castration . we became two more sleepy indians .
i would rather go to viet nam .
would somebody please pass me the catsup ?
what you say is , pass the fucking catsup .
pass the fucking catsup .
you actually sold insurance !
get used to it . back door , paul .
i have considered that .
selling vacuum cleaners is not the best preparation you could have .
i just want one true adventure before i die .
that can be arranged .
you are making a joke .
i am interested in long term expectations .
it is engineered to last about fifteen years .
things . oh you silly people and your things . things , things , things .
never mind the condition of your body and your spirit ! look after your things , your things !
what ?
we got to get another pilot .
for what ?
for africa .
do you really think that harold ryan would go to africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman ?
you invited me .
to make an ass of yourself .
what went wrong ?
we are ahead of schedule , that is all . you are finding out here what you would have found out in africa that you are a rabbit , born to be eaten alive .
gee whiz
it would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us .
i would not drop my gun .
you are hollow , like a woman .
i am smarter than looseleaf .
he can shoot ! he can hold his ground ! he can attack ! you are in your proper profession right now sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives , closet drunkards every one .
how do you know how i would act in africa ?
look how you are acting now ! this is a moment of truth , and you are almost crying . slug me !
you are my buddy .
out ! out !
no matter what you say to me , i still think you are the greatest guy i ever knew .
out !
you you are not going to have any friends left , if you do not watch out .
thank god !
as a matter of fact
sir ?
as a matter of fact i am home .
hello .
hello .
are you
are you do you
ask it !
do you know who wanda june is ?
life has denied me that thrill .
do you mind if i ask who you are ?
mind ? god , yes , i mind . i am your father s friend . a man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago .
dr . woodly .
dr . woodly . i should make a little list .
is anybody besides you here now ?
the doctor was called away on an emergency . i think it was birth .
where is mom ?
you do not know where your mother is ? does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night ?
she went to the fight with herb shuttle , i guess .
you think you could find me a pencil and paper ?
i will see .
i was going to a funny movie , but i changed my mind . if you are depressed , laughing does not help much . when did you know my father ?
man and boy .
everybody says he was so brave .
even this herb shuttle , you said ?
he worships father .
ah ! and what sort of man is this worshiper ?
he is a vacuum cleaner salesman .
i see . and he came into the apartment one day , to demonstrate his wares , and your mother , as it happened , was charmingly en deshabille
she met him at college .
college !
they were in the same creative writing class .
college ?
she has a master s degree in english literature .
what a pity ! educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine swiss watch . everything stops . and the doctor ? he worships your father , too ?
he insults him all the time .
excellent !
that is good about that ?
it makes life spicy .
he does not do it in front of me , but he does it with mother . you know what he called father one time ?
no .
harold , the patron saint of taxidermy .
what does he do of an athletic nature ?
nothing . he plays a violin in a doctors quartet .
aha ! he has a brilliant military record , i am sure .
he was a stretcher bearer in the korean war . were you in a war with father ?
big ones , little ones , teeny weeny ones just and otherwise .
tell me some true stories about dad .
dad ? dad . the boy wants tales of derring do . name a country .
england ?
oh hell .
dad was never in england ?
behind a desk for a little while . a desk ! they had him planning air raids . a city cannot flee like a coward or fight like a man , and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of harold ryan . there was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice , and that was making the choice himself . ask about spain , where he was the youngest soldier in the abraham lincoln brigade . he was a famous sniper . they called him la picadura the sting .
the sting .
as in death , where is thy sting ? he killed at least fifty men , wounded hundreds more .
the sting .
ask about the time he and i were parachuted into yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band in the war against the nazis .
tell me that .
i saw your father fight major siegfried von konigswald , the beast of yugoslavia , hand to hand .
tell me that ! tell me that !
hid by day fought by night . at sunset one day , your father and i , peering through field glasses , saw a black mercedes draw up to a village inn . it was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car . out of the mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history the beast of yugoslavia .
wow .
we blacked our hands and faces . at midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village . the name of the village was mhravitch . remember that name !
mhravitch .
we came up behind a sentry , and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound .
uck .
do not care for cold steel ? a knife is worse than a bullet ?
i do not know .
the story gets hairier . should i stop ?
go on .
we caught another kraut alone in a back lane . your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire . your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire . that is nicer than a knife , is not it as long as you do not look at the face afterwards . the face turns a curious shade of avocado . i must ask the doctor why that is . at any rate , we stole into the back of the inn , and , with the permission of the management , we poisoned the wine of six krauts who were carousing there .
where did you get the poison ?
we carried cyanide capsules . we were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured . it was your father s opinion that the krauts needed them more than we did at the time .
and one of them was the beast of yugoslavia ? harold the beast was upstairs , and he came running downstairs , for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments editorializing about the hospitality they had received . and your father said to him in perfect german , which he had learned in the spanish civil war , major , something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard . i am harold ryan , of the united states of america . you , i believe , are the beast of yugoslavia .
mhravitch .
the name will live forever . it was there that harold ryan slew the beast of yugoslavia . mhravitch .
when i grow up , i am going to go to mhravitch .
it is rather a disappointment these days . it is not there any more .
sir ?
the germans shot everybody who lived there , then leveled it , plowed it , planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground . they wished revenge for the slaying of the beast of yugoslavia . to their twisted way of thinking , your father had butchered an eagle scout . play lots of contact sports ?
i wanted to go out for football , but mom was afraid i would get hurt .
you are supposed to get hurt !
dr . woodly says he is seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football . he says that when there s a war , everybody goes but football players .
does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that ?
they are not engaged .
he seems to think they are . he told me that were .
oh no , no , no , no , no . it cannot be . how embarrassing .
you are a very good boy to respond that way .
no , no , no , no , no .
i would like to use the sanitary facilities , if i may .
go ahead . no , no , no , no .
sir ?
is looseleaf harper alive ?
alive and hale . he is throwing a little surprise party for his own family . is your mother often this unstable ? penelope !
she is a real heavy sleeper sometimes .
why do not you go to bed son .
i cannot take my eyes off you .
tomorrow s another day . paul you know what my english literature teacher said about you ?
cannot it keep till morning ?
she said you were legendary . i wrote a theme about you , and she said , your father is a legendary hero out of the golden age of heroes .
that is nice . you thank her for me . go to bed and get lots of sleep , and then you thank her in the morning .
tomorrow s saturday . anyway , she is dead .
penelope !
she was killed in the park two months ago in the daytime .
penelope !
she was on her way home from a meeting of the african violet society , and they got her .
will you go to bed ?
yes sir . if you cannot wake mom up , i have got double decker bunks .
scat !
damn .
mom ?
your mother and i do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours .
the smallest thing i have got .
can i get dressed first ?
make it fast .
could not you have vanished quietly out the back door ?
a hundred dollars for breakfast ?
leave a tip .
beat the shit out of someone who hates you .
we have got to do something to make this boy s voice change . i wonder if we could not get bull balls somewhere , and fry em up . still miss your mother ?
no .
you are free to go to her , if you want . if you would rather be a woman and run with the women , just say the word .
who was it ?
it is mom .
that is this ?
nothing .
that is a rifle you have ?
no .
of course it is . is it loaded ?
no .
open the bolt !
pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber where it belongs .
gee whiz , dad
welcome to manhood , you little sparrowfart ! load that gun !
dad
too late ! it is man to man now . protecting your mother from me , are you ? protect her !
i do not want to fight you .
get mad ! tell me you do not like the way i treat your mother ! tell me you wish i would never come home !
it is your house , dad .
everybody simply evaporates ! there are guest issues to be fought out here or to be argued , at least . the enemy , the champion of all who oppose me , is in east st . louis with his mother and his aunt ! i have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a violin .
i am talking to you gently now .
yeah . but it is going to get loud again .
i am harold ryan , her husband . i have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts as a professional soldier . i have killed thousands of other animals as well for sport .
heaven .
i think so , daughter . how old are you ?
eighteen and a half .
a springbok , an oryx , a gemsbok a gazelle .
sir ?
raw hamburger , please and a whole onion . i want to eat the onion like an apple . do you understand ?
yes , sir . it was a very unusual automobile . it was a cadillac , but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be . and what to drink ?
what time do you get off work , my child ?
i am sorry , sir , i am engaged to be married . my boyfriend would be mad if i went out with another man .
did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire ?
i am engaged .
daughter i love you very much .
you do not even know me .
you are woman . i know woman well .
this is crazy .
destiny often seems that way . you are going to marry me .
what do you do for a living ?
my parents died in an automobile accident when i was sixteen years old . they left me a brewery and a baseball team and other things . i live for a living . i have just come back from kenya in africa . i have been hunting mau mau there .
some kind of animal ?
the pelt is black . it is a kind of man .
how do you do , mrs . ryan ? i would heard you were beautiful , and so you are . am i intruding here ?
not at all .
i could not help overhearing that you were about to get married again .
give us time .
like hugging a lamp post .
give us time , harold to adjust to your being alive .
you were well adjusted to my being dead ?
we adjust to what there is to adjust to . perhaps paul , being young , can adjust to joy or grief immediately . i hope he can . i will take a little longer . i will be as quick as i can .
what sort of time period do you have in mind ? half an hour ? an hour ?
i do not know . this is a new disease to me .
disease ?
situation .
this reunion is not what i imagined it would be .
a telegram a phone call might have helped .
seemed the most honest way to begin life together again natural , unrehearsed .
well enjoy the natural , honest , unrehearsed result surgical shock .
you feel that you are behaving as a woman should ?
every fuse in my nervous system has been blown .
you would better get dr . woodly .
we thought a doctor might help .
your old beau ?
we thought it was an emergency .
i do not want that chancre mechanic in here .
he is a very decent man , harold .
we all are .
should not you lie down ?
when i am dead or fucking .
paul said you were awfully sick .
i was , i was . it never lasts long .
nothing would please me more .
thank god !
have some .
i could carve a better man out of a banana !
please
you and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles . you know who filled that bag for you ? not alice sit by the fires like yourself . men with guts filled it , by god men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles suffering , ingratitude , loneliness , death
he thought he could take my place . it is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why i do not think he is man enough to do that .
say hello to your mother .
do say hello to your mother .
ghastly , cruel , unnecessary .
you will get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again . you used to eat it up .
i did ?
we were one hell of a pair and we will be one again . what we need is a honeymoon . let s start right now .
a trip , you mean ?
i had a trip . we will honeymoon here . go out and play .
buy yourself breakfast . there we go .
it is so so stark .
you used to like it stark !
just bang we have a honeymoon .
i am not going to strike you . i am going to be as gentle as pie as lemon meringue pie . you must not run away now . this is your loving husband approaching . i am your husband . society approves !
turn around ?
i am not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty . what i have in mind is massage a perfectly decent massage . turn around , turn around .
you should not have talked to norbert that way .
you are thinking with your brain instead of your body . that is why you are so tense ! forget norbert . relax . it is body time .
i have a brain .
we all do . but now it is body time . relax . ideally , the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with devonshire cream . you feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods . think of your muscles one by one . let them go slack . relax . let the brain go blank . relax . that is the idea that is my girl . now the small of the back . let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl .
ram it up your ass !
scrambled eggs , kippered herring , fried potatoes and a whole onion . i want to eat the onion like an apple . do you understand ?
mrs . wheeler is dead .
all right bring me a side order of mrs . wheeler . oh , hell sit down , colonel . penelope will bring you some chow .
that is the most heartless statement i ever heard pass between human lips .
which one ?
bring me a side order of mrs . wheeler .
she is up in heaven now . she did not hear . she is experiencing nothing but pure happiness . there s nothing nicer than that . chow ! harold ryan wants chow !
what a honeymoon .
honeymoon temporarily canceled . the boy should still go out and exercise . i have the impression he never gets any exercise . he simply bloats himself with fig newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators .
you are wrong .
then let me see him go out and get some exercise . right now !
we are all going to have to go out for breakfast . the cook quit yesterday .
you are a woman , are not you ?
people do not use that word any more .
do not lecture me on race relations . i do not have a molecule of prejudice . i have been in battle with every kind of man there is . i have been in bed with every kind of woman there is from a laplander to a tierra del fuegian . if i would ever been to the south pole , there would be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me . cook !
you leave me so so without without dignity .
people now have dignity when frying eggs ?
they do not have to feel like slaves .
then go now and fry with dignity sunnyside up .
i i was wondering is there anything you should not eat because of jungle fever ?
i could eat a raw baby crocodile . the way to get your wife back is in bed . do such a job on her that she will be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours . we are starving . do you mind ?
no .
what then ?
i do not wish to be scrogged ever . i never heard that word , but when i heard it , i knew it was one thing i never wanted to have happen to me .
that is what you are supposed to say .
this is not a coy deception . i do not want to be scrogged . i want love . i want tenderness .
you do not know you want . that is the way god built you !
i will not be scrogged . i remember one time i saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers , and you promised me that the fish could not feel .
it could not !
i would like to have the expert opinion of the fish along with yours .
fish cannot feel .
well , i can . some injuries , spiritual or physical , can be excruciating to me . i am not a silly carhop any more . maybe you are right about fish . when i was a carhop , i did not feel much more than a fish would . but i have been sensitized . i have ideas now and solid information . i know a lot more now and a lot of it has to do with you .
such as ? . . .
the whole concept of heroism and its sexual roots .
tell me about its sexual roots .
it is complicated and i do not want to go into it now , because it is bound to sound insulting even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted . it is just the truth .
i like the truth . i would not be alive today if i were not one of the biggest fans truth ever had .
well part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long , and make awful messes while they are there .
go on .
and they have very mixed feelings about women . they hate them in a way . one reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently . they can scrog them , as you say for revenge .
you learned this in some college course ?
i learned a lot of things in college . actually it was norbert who told me that .
the doctor .
yes .
and what is his most cherished possession ?
his most cherished possession ? his violin , i guess .
and he keeps it in his apartment ?
yes .
and no one s there now ?
i do not think so .
that is too bad . i would rather have him at home to see what i am going to do .
what are you going to do ?
he did his best to destroy my most precious possession , which is the high opinion women have of me . i am now going to even that score . i am going to break in his door and i am going to smash his violin .
no you are not !
why not ?
because if you do i will leave you . harold goodbye .
sneaking in the back door .
i rang . it seemed like the proper door for a servile , worthless organism to use .
your clothes are at the city dump by now . perhaps you can get a map from the department of sanitation .
i came for paul as well .
if he wants to go .
you took him to the funeral , i hear .
he would never seen a corpse . he is seen a dozen now .
a dozen ?
it is a big and busy funeral home .
did you like it , dear ?
it is not a matter of liking . it is a matter of getting used to death as a perfectly natural thing . would you mind leaving ? no woman ever walks out on harold ryan , and then comes back for anything .
unless she has nerve .
more nerve than the doctor , i must admit . he has not been home for two days . has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television and the violin ?
he knows you shattered his violin .
i am dying to hear of his reaction . the thrill of smashing something is not in the smashing , but in the owner s reactions .
he cried .
about a broomstick and a cigar box and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat .
two hundred years old .
he feels awful loss which was precisely my intention .
he had hoped that someone would be playing it still two hundred years from now .
hope .
you feel i have done a dreadful thing leaving him ?
almost a christmas scene .
goodbye , goodbye , goodbye .
just one favor .
money ? there s plenty of that . mildred got the brewery . you will probably get the baseball team .
i want you to tell me that you loved me once .
i see .
how unhappy he is going to be alone in his room .
he will play with his rifle , i expect . that will cheer him up .
rifle ?
i bought him a twenty two yesterday on the way home from hamburger heaven . and where is the good doctor ? have you two feathered a love nest somewhere ?
he is in east st . louis with his mother visiting an aunt .
last i heard , his mother was going alone .
he is afraid of you , harold . he knew you would want to fight him . he does not know anything about fighting . he hates pain .
and you , a supposedly healthy woman , do not detest him for his cowardice ?
it seems highly intelligent to me .
what kind of a country has this become ? the men wear beads and refuse to fight and the woman adore them . america s days of greatness are over . it has drunk the blue soup .
blue soup ?
an indian narcotic we were forced to drink . it put us in a haze a honey colored haze which was lavender around the edge . we laughed , we sang , we snoozed . when a bird called , we answered back . every living thing was our brother or our sister , we thought . looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long , and we cried . we had a funeral that went on for five days for the cockroach ! i sang oh promise me . can you imagine ? where the hell did i ever learn the words to oh promise me ? looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a b . all the time we were drinking more blue soup , more blue soup ! never stopped drinking blue soup . blue soup all the time . we would go out after food in that honey colored haze , and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender .
sounds quite beautiful .
beautiful , you say ? it was not life , it was not death it was not anything ! beautiful ? seven years gone like that , like that ! seven years of silliness and random dreams ! seven years of nothingness , when there could have been so much !
like what ?
action ! interaction ! give and take ! challenge and response !
with an iron penis three feet long . load it , boy .
you are begging him to kill you ?
if he thinks he is man enough .
that is really what you want . you become furious when people will not make you dead .
i am teaching my son to be a man .
so he can kill you . you hate your own life that much . you beg for a hero to kill you .
i plan to live one hundred years !
no you do not .
if that is the case that is to prevent my killing myself ?
honor , i suppose .
what a handsome word .
but it is all balled up in your head with death . the highest honor is death . when you talk of these animals , one by one , you do not just talk of killing them . you honored them with death . harold it is not honor to be killed .
if you have lived a good life , fought well
it is still just death , the absence of life no honor at all . it is worse than the blue soup by far that nothingness . to you , though , it is the honor that crowns them all .
may i continue with the rearing of my son ? load that gun !
i feel mocked , insulted , with no sort of satisfaction in prospect . we do not have to fight with steel . i can fight with words . i am not an inarticulate ape , you know , who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary . call him up in east st . louis , penelope . tell him to come here .
no .
no .
i do not know . i hope he never hunts . i hope he never kills another human being .
you hope this , too ?
do not !
stop !
there has to be a threat of some sort , nobility of some sort , glamour of some sort , sport of some sort . these elements are lacking .
ah ! the lady is armed .
i want you to get out of here , norbert . harold i want you to sit down in the chair , and not lift a finger until norbert is gone .
whoever has the gun , you see , gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do . it is the american way .
i mean it !
then you would better fix your bayonet , because there are not any bullets in the gun .
where is the bullet ?
there it is . give it to me .
load it for her .
the national safety council would be appalled .
then listen to me . you are both disgusting with your pride , your pride . i hate you for coming here like a federal marshal in a western film . i loved you when you stayed away . but here you are now high noon in the superbowl ! you fool , you fool .
out !
you have killed women ?
seventeen of them eleven by accident . march ! move ! you , too !
of course he can go if he will just go down on his hands and knees for a moment and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree .
do it , norbert .
ooops .
can i uh help you gentlemen ?
gentlemen that is nice .
you startled me .
it is always locked .
but here you are inside , are not you ?
you are you are old friends of harold ryan ?
we tried to be . we tried to be .
he is dead , you know .
dead ! such a final word . dead ! did you hear that ?
hello , mother .
. . . who ? . . . did she say how far apart the pains were ? . . . when was that ? . . . oh dear .
oh dear .
call her back tell her to head for the hospital . tell the hospital to expect her . i will leave right now .
we will miss you so .
look this is not my apartment , and there is not anybody else here . mrs . ryan will not be home for a while .
oh , oh , oh i thought it was your apartment . you seemed at home here .
i am a neighbor . i have the apartment across the hall . i have to go to the hospital now . an emergency .
ahh then she is still alive .
she is fine . please
and still mrs . harold ryan ?
will you please go ? an emergency !
she still has just the one child the boy ?
and what , exactly , is your relationship to mrs . ryan ?
neighbor ! doctor ! i live across the hall .
and you come into mrs . ryangs apartment as often as you please , looking into various health matters ?
yes ! please ! you have got to get out right now !
and her fianc !
and her fianc ! how nice . i hope you will be very happy or is that what one says to the woman ?
i have got to run !
i have literally got to run !
i will not try to keep up with you . i am not as fast on my feet as i once was .
i came back .
a policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab .
tough luck . you will have to split the fee .
are are you crying , penelope ?
she is crying because she is so happy .
what next ? you leave promptly , of course . there is no question as to whose home this is
none .
whose son this is , whose wife that is . a fianc is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time . good night .
good night .
what a brilliant diagnosis !
i know malaria . malaria is not caused by the bites of bats .
you have been bitten by bats ?
colonel harper and i once shared a treetop with a family of bats . there was a flash flood . there were piranha fish in the water . that is how colonel harper lost his little toe .
you have chills ?
chills , fevers , sweats . you can describe it and name it after yourself the woodly galloping crud .
i was going to ask .
pacqualinincheewa root .
would you say that again ?
pacqualinincheewa root . means cougar fang . cures anything but a yellow streak down the back .
i have never heard of it .
congratulations . by crossing twenty eight feet of cockroach infested carpet , you have become the third white man ever to hear of it .
are you have seen it work cures ?
hundreds .
more and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people . curare , ephedrine we have found some amazing things .
we have , have we ?
that is an editorial we , of course . i have not turned up anything personally .
everything about you is the editorial we . take that away from you , and you would disappear .
i can just hear the editorial wee wee weeing when looseleaf and i start flying in pacqualinincheewa root . i can hear the alice sit by the fires now we discovered it in the amazon rain forest . now we cure you with it . now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks .
you were wrong , you quack !
what for ?
quarantine , possibly . you may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the american people could do without . goodbye .
this little corpse is intended as a lesson ?
there s a certain amount of information there .
lest we forget how cruel you are .
it is healer to killer . is that the same thing ?
what brought you back ?
the same hairy , humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon . honor , if you like .
he is a champion after all . woodly of the corpses and cripples you create for our instruction when all we can learn from them is this how cruel you are .
yes .
i can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers . but he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish harold ryan with words . the truth ! correct ?
correct .
what an hallucination ! oh , dear , dear , dear , dear . oh dearie me .
you have not heard me yet .
you intend to crack my eardrums with your voice ? will i bleed from my every orifice ? who will clean up this awful mess ?
we will find out now , will not we ?
oooooo . that hurt .
you are old so old .
now who s being cruel ?
a living fossil ! like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs .
we do survive , do not we ? you are going to have to apologize , of course , for calling me a bastard . that is a matter of form not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard . no rush about that . just remember to apologize sometime soon .
yes well uh that is another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology . whenever you feel like it . it is sort of like turning off an alarm clock that is ringing loudly . your apology turns off the alarm .
comical ?
and terror , if you do not mind .
i am high as a kite .
glands . you are supposed to be happy when you die . call me comical again .
you are a clown . you are a clown who kills but you are a clown .
i love you ! have a cigar !
evolution has made you a clown with a cigar . simple butchers like you are obsolete !
i am to be left behind in primordial ooze ?
if you are at home in the ooze , and nowhere else .
this is going to become very physical . are you prepared for that ?
you are not such a creature of the ooze that you would hurt an unarmed man .
i am an honorable clown ?
king arthur .
you hope .
in any event , i will not beg for mercy .
no quarter asked . no quarter given .
do not you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew ?
cut me open . find out .
i have struck my blow .
with spittle ?
i have poisoned you . harold lucretia borgia ? something i drank or touched ? you refused a cigar . that is it ! potassium cyanide in the humidor ! treacherous lover of peace !
i put a poisoned thought in your head . even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind . it is saying , obsolete , obsolete , obsolete , and , clown , clown , clown .
poison .
you have a very good mind , or i would not have come back . that mind is now asking itself , cleverly and fairly , is harold ryan really a clown ? and the answer is , yes .
i i really must congratulate you . something is happening in there .
you can never take yourself seriously again ! look at all the creatures you have protected us from ! did you shoot them on the elevator , as they were on their way up here to eat us alive ?
no . woodly the magic root you gave me i had it analyzed . it was discovered by a harvard botanist in ! he explored your famous jungle for five years , armed with nothing but kindness , a talent for languages , and a pocketknife .
i see .
you are not going to hurt me . you are not going to hurt anybody any more . any violent gesture will seem ridiculous to yourself !
don quixote .
my violin is avenged !
something seems to have happened to my self respect .
and the hell with it . it was so tragically irrelevant , so preposterously misinformed .
the new hero is you .
i hate crowds , and i have no charisma
you are too modest .
but the new hero will be a man of science and of peace like me . he will disarm you , of course . no more guns , no more guns .
was i ever of use ?
never . for when you began to kill for the fun of it , you became the chief source of agony of mankind .
i am utterly satisfied .
you are making a mistake . obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded . you have wounded me .
more clowning ! do not you see ?
we never quit fighting until we are dead .
you would be killing a friend . do not you know how much i like you ?
i am going to shoot you now .
no !
my self respect is gone and my soldier s honor with it . it is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man .
new dignity can be yours as a merciful man . you can change !
like the saber toothed tiger .
oh god you are really going to kill me . harold it will not hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee . heaven is very much like paradise , they say . you will like it there .
can i beg for mercy on my knees ?
if you want to be found that way .
what is this thing that kills me ?
man , as man was meant to be a vengeful ape who murders . he will soon be extinct . it is time , it is time .
do not shoot .
i have enjoyed being man .
get up .
no .
have it your way . we would both be better off dead now .
thank god . harold crawl home .
it is trash now , like mine .
new lives begin !
somewhere in this city . not here , not here . tell penelope i loved her in my clownish way . and paul . tell him to be a healer , by all means .
what are you going to do ?
use the sanitary facilities , if i may .
leave the rifle here .
i will put it in paul s room , where it belongs .
give me your word of honor that that is all you are going to do .
for what it is worth now , harold ryan , the clown , gives his sacred word .
colonel harper , retired now , dropped an atom bomb on nagasaki during the second world war , killing seventy four thousand people in a flash .
i dunno , boy .
you do not know ?
it was a bitch .
thank you . you can leave now . we will begin .
i dunno . yeah ! yeah ! yeah ! i did .
she did ?
you did not even find that out ?
there was so much going on .
she married an accountant named stanley kestenbaum .
so that is it ! kestenbaum , kestenbaum . everybody was yelling kestenbaum , kestenbaum . i thought it was some foreign language .
jesus .
alice is dead ?
no , no shit no . excuse me , penelope .
for what ?
for saying shit . or is that okay now ?
who s dead ?
my mother in law . fire engines , pulmotors , doctors , cops , coroners
what happened ?
well i walked up to the front door . i was still alive . big surprise . i rang the doorbell , and old mrs . wheeler answered . she had her goddamn knitting . i said , guess who ? she conked right out .
how horrible .
yeah cripes . i never did get any sense out of alice . she found me holding up the old lady , dead as a mackerel . it was a bitch . you know maybe mrs . wheeler was going to die then and there anyway , even if i would been the paper boy . maybe not . i dunno , boy . that is civilian life for you . who knows what kills anybody ?
i dunno .
what will you do , colonel ?
i dunno . marry the first whore who s nice to me , i guess . get a job in a motorcycle shop . so long , you guys .
thought you were another wife , maybe .
i am only ten years old .
that is what he wanted a ten year old wife . he would come home from a war or a safari , and he would wind up talking to the little kids .
will not you please join our club ? please ?
honey alcoholics anonymous takes all the time i have got and harold ryan is an individual i would rather forget . he drove me to drink . he drove his first two wives to drink .
i heard you were looking for me .
you were harold ryangs third wife . right ?
yes .
you want to join the harold ryan fan club ? wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back ?
do i have to ? who s the little girl ?
premature ejaculation .
ach soooooooooo . mildred no grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation . harold would come home trumpeting and roaring . he would the kick the furniture with his boots , spit into corners and the fireplace . he would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them . he would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him , and he would tear off my clothes . he would carry me into the bedroom , telling me to scream and kick my feet . that was very important to him . i did it . i tried to be a good wife . he told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo . i could not do that , but i pretended i did . it was all over ten seconds after he would said the word buffalo . then he would zip up his pants , and go outside , and tell true war stories to the little kids . any little kids .
that is sad .
is it ? i have this theory about why men kill each other and break things .
ja ?
never mind . it is a dumb theory . i was going to say it was all sexual . . but everything is sexual . . . but alcohol . peace .
i do not care what she wears .
something s made you sore .
do not worry about it .
you bet i will worry about it . i said something wrong ?
it is my father s birthday that is all . that is all . who cares about that ?
i had not the slightest inkling . why did not you say so ?
she does not care ! she is not married any more ! she is going to have fun ! i hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it . dr . woodly i hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you have said so far .
kid kid
and i wish you would quit touching me all the time . it drives me nuts !
that is this ?
do not !
you sure misunderstood something and we would better get it straight .
explain it to them . i am bugging out of here .
men can touch other men , and it does not mean a thing . have not you ever seen football players after they have won the superbowl ?
everybody talks about how rotten kids act . grownups can be pretty rotten , too .
what a relief !
i do not want to live any more .
i feel like i want to yell my head off just yell anything . bulllllllllllllll dickey !
i will kill myself .
the wife of harold ryan is going to marry a pansy next ? this is the end of western civilization as far as i am concerned . you must be crazy as a fruitcake .
would not you rather have your mother marry me than him ?
no .
all my dreams have suddenly collapsed . we did have a lot of laughs together , penelope .
he is coming back , mom ! he is the bravest , most wonderful man who ever lived .
i told you this was a simple minded play .
maybe he will come back tonight ! it is his birthday .
i know .
stay home tonight !
oh , paul
you are married ! you have already got a husband !
he is a ghost !
he is alive !
not even mutual of omaha thinks so anymore .
if you have to go out with some guy cannot he be more like dad ? herb shuttle and norbert woodly cannot you do better than those two freaks ?
thank you , kind sir .
a vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor .
a what kind of doctor ?
a fairy a queer . everybody in the building knows he is a queer .
that is an interesting piece of news .
you are the only woman he ever took out .
not true .
still lives with his mother .
you know she has no feet ! you want him to abandon his mother , who has no husband , who has no money of her own , who has no feet ?
how did she lose her feet ?
in a railroad accident many years ago .
i was afraid to ask .
norbert was just beginning practice . a real man would have sold her to a catfood company , i suppose . as far as that goes , j . edgar hoover still lives with his mother .
i did not know that .
a lot of people do not .
j . edgar hoover plays sports .
i do not really know .
to only exercise dr . woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign . peace . peace . peace , everybody .
it is beautiful .
anywhere but here . i would just sit here and cry about the way my father s been forgotten .
who have you been talking to ?
what difference does that make ? is dr . woodly going to be my father now ?
aaaaaaaaaaaaaah !
no .
then who flushed the toilet ?
father s friend .
that is his name ?
do not know .
for heavengs sakes !
that man is your father .
what ?
there stands the loins from which you have sprung .
i do not get it .
it is you , is not it , harold ?
dr . woodly ? you know who this is ?
shivers and sweats and groans . his teeth chatter . what will we do ?
what does he say to do ?
he can hardly talk .
it is an emergency , is not it ?
yeah .
then get him .
okay .
you are taking mom out tonight ?
you are going out ?
oh ?
a monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat .
my father !
i apologize . but you did not know him , and neither did i . how is your asthma ?
do not worry about it .
how is the fungus around your thumbnail ?
it is fine !
it is jungle rot ! this room is making everybody sick ! this is your family doctor speaking now . here i brought you something else to hang on your wall , for the sake of variety .
keeps fairies away !
maybe it is supposed to end now . maybe god would not have it any other way .
he is not any friend of father .
he is not ?
he is my father .
no !
he is not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom .
i will get ready , herb . i did not expect you this soon . please will not everybody be nice to everybody else while i am gone ?
doing what ?
he would kill me . he would be right to kill me , too the kind of guy he is .
or was . we have not done anything wrong , you know .
he would assume we had .
that is something i suppose .
all through the day i am so confident . that is why i am such a good salesman , you know ? i have confidence , and i look like i have confidence , and that gives other people confidence . people laugh sometimes when they find out i am a vacuum cleaner salesman . they stop laughing , though , when they find out i made forty three thousand dollars last year . i have got six other salesmen working under me , and what they all plug into is my confidence . that is what charges them up .
i am glad .
i was captain of the wrestling team at lehigh university .
i know .
if you want to wrestle , you got lehigh . if you want to play tennis , you go to vanderbilt .
i do not want to go to vanderbilt .
you do not wrestle if you do not have supreme confidence , and i wrestled . but when i get with you , and i say to myself , my god here i am with the wife of harold ryan , one of the great heroes of all time
something happens to my confidence .
this conversation took place , incidentally , about three months before harold was declared legally dead .
when harold is definitely out of the picture , penelope , when i do not have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or paul wrong . i am going to ask you to be my wife .
i am touched .
that is when i will get my confidence back .
i see .
if you will pardon the expression , that is when you will see the fur and feathers fly . good night .
good night .
women are always late . you will find out .
beautiful ! i have never seen that coat .
seven jaguars skins , i am told . harold shot every one . shall we go ?
we could have had some kind of birthday party for him . we could have taken paul to the fight with us .
yeah .
is he all right ?
far as i know .
is he coming home ?
he ditched me . he started running , and i started running , then he lost me in the park .
the park !
it is dark in there . penelope and that is where he is !
i figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another .
you figure !
then i saw this bakery store that was still open , so i bought a birthday cake .
a what ?
for harold . when paul comes home , we can have some birthday cake .
how nice .
they had this cake somebody else had not picked up . it says , happy birthday , somebody else .
before he started to run . he said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck and someday we would all hear the sound of that key in the door .
we have got to find him . i want you to show me exactly where you saw him last . and you stay here , norbert , in case he comes home . that is all he said the thing about the key ?
he said one other thing . it was not very nice .
what was it ?
he told me to take a flying fuck at the moon .
we got a birthday cake , kid . did you see the cake ?
how long has this been going on ?
a week . we were waiting for the right time to
i feel as though i had been made a perfect chump of .
i am sorry .
marry me instead .
thank you , herb . you are a wonderful man . you really are . everybody respects you for what you have done for scouting and the little league .
you are saying no .
i am saying no and thank you .
i did not make my move fast enough . that is it , is not it ? i was too respectful .
you were wonderful .
that is so wonderful if i lost the sale ? you poor kid .
well it was nice while it lasted . thanks for the memories .
he is the most wonderful guy i ever met , penelope . he is the most complicated guy i ever met . i cannot believe it , but he is going to take me to africa with him .
would you like to say something about killing , colonel ?
take plenty of cigars .
we made the date three months ago .
i must take you to an emergency ward sometime on a saturday night . that is also fun . i came to see selma , as a matter of fact .
she quit this afternoon .
i am glad somebody finally cried . every time i come in here and see all this unnecessary death , i want to cry . i do not cry , of course . not manly , you know . did she try antihistamines ?
they made her so sleepy she could not work .
throw out all this junk . burn it ! this room crawls with tropical disease .
no doubt paul thinks it stinks .
what ?
wear a coat of domestic mink . for the love of god , though , penelope , do not lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you .
tonight s the night .
it is ?
the wilder paul is tonight , the calmer he will be tomorrow .
as long as he keeps out of the park .
after this explosion , i think , he will be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again .
the only thing i ever told him about life was , keep out of the park after the sun goes down .
we have got to dump shuttle . he brings his vacuum cleaner on dates ?
that is the xke .
the what ?
it is an experimental model . he does not dare leave it in his car , for fear it will fall into the hands of competition .
what kind of a life is that ?
he told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was . he made eagle scout when he was twenty nine years old . oh , norbert promise me that paul has not gone into the park !
if you warned him against it as much as you say , it is almost a certainty .
no ! oh no ! three people murdered in there in the last six weeks ! the police will not even go in there any more .
i wish paul luck .
it is suicide !
i would be dead by now if that were the case .
meaning ?
every night , penelope , for the past two years , i have made it a point to walk through the park at midnight .
why would you do that ?
to show myself how brave i am . the issue s in doubt , you know since i am always for peace
i am amazed .
me , too . i know something not even the police know that is in the park at midnight . nothing . or , when i am in there , there s me in there . fear and nobody and me .
and maybe paul . what about the murderers ? they are in there !
they did not murder me .
paul s only twelve years old .
he can make the sound of human footsteps which is a terrifying sound .
we have got to rescue him .
if he is in the park , luck is all that can save him now , and there s plenty of that .
he is not your son .
no . but he is going to be . if he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side , i can say to him , you and i are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight . on that we can build .
it is a jungle out there .
that is been said before .
he would go to a movie . i think that is what he would do . if i were sure he was in a movie , i could stop worrying . we could have him paged .
we met here earlier this evening .
how neat . how keen .
i believe in miracles now .
tell her to have a nice trip .
thanks .
it is really that bad ?
oh look at the poor , crucified violin , would you ?
you fake ! you are no better than the dumbest general in the pentagon . you are not going to beat harold . you are not going to beat anybody . you are not going to stay here , either yammering and taunting until you are most gloriously killed . go home !
goodbye .
i am glad you brought your vacuum cleaner .
is that a fact ?
that maid just quit . the place is a mess . you can start in the master bedroom .
not true .
or get eaten alive .
that is not true either or need not be , unless we make it true .
phooey .
which we do . but we can stop doing that .
penelope ! we are late !
i am sick of this argument . i just have one more thing to say if you elect a president , you support him , no matter what he does . that is the only way you can have a country !
it is the planet that is in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon .
none of my relatives are chinese communists . speak for yourself .
chinese maniacs and russian maniacs and american maniacs and french maniacs and british maniacs have turned this lovely , moist , nourishing blue green ball into a doomsday device . let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile , and that is the end of mankind .
you can believe that if you want . i talk to guys like you , and i want to commit suicide . you get that weight lifting set i sent you ?
maybe god has let everybody who ever lived be reborn so he or she can see how it ends . even pithecanthropus erectus and australopithecus and sinanthropus pekensis and the neanderthalers are back on earth to see how it ends . they are all on times square making change for peepshows . or recruiting marines .
you ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day ?
he died of a massive rupture .
you think you are so funny . you are not even funny . right ? right ? you do not hurt yourself if you start out slow .
you are preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of dubuque ? take care of your body , yes ! but do not become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes . do not become obsessed by your musculature . any one of these poor , dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be . their magic was in their muscles . your magic is in your brains !
it is good . let him go .
if he would just come out for the little league , the way i asked him , he would find out we touch all the time shove each other , slug each other , and just horse around . i am going to go get him
do not ! let him have all the privacy he wants . let him grieve , let him rage . there has never been a funeral for his father .
what a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage .
i feel like i have been double crossed . if you would just told me it was harold s birthday
then we would stay home and eat venison or something , and look through the scrapbooks . i have got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat . i am going to bring that boy back .
we can take off the wanda june with a butter knife .
yes , we do .
we only have two members so far , but it is growing all the time .
we have enough for a shuffleboard team . in heaven , shuffleboard is everything . hitler plays shuffleboard .
albert einstein plays shuffleboard .
mozart plays shuffleboard .
lewis carroll , who wrote alice in wonderland , plays shuffleboard .
jack the ripper plays shuffleboard .
walt disney , who gave us snow white and the seven dwarfs , plays shuffleboard . jesus christ plays shuffleboard .
it was almost worth the trip to find out that jesus christ in heaven was just another guy , playing shuffleboard . i like his sense of humor , though you know ? he is got a blue and gold warm up jacket he wears . you know what it says on the back ? pontius pilate athletic club . most people do not get it . most people think there really is a pontius pilate athletic club .
we are going to have jackets , are not we ?
you bet ! the harold ryan fan club . pink , eh ? with a yellow streak up the back . we got very good tailor shops up here . they will make you any kind of uniform , any kind of sweatsuit you want . judas iscariot he is got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart . he walks around all hunched over , and he never looks anybody in the eye , and written on the back of his jacket are the words , go take a flying
no .
what we offer here is nude body to body contact on a bed in a private room . it is twenty dollars a half hour , thirty dollars an hour . anything else you desire may be discussed in the privacy of your room . tips are allowed . we accept bank americard , master charge and american express .
i do not really want . . . body to body contact .
that you may discuss with the girl of your choice in the privacy of your room .
you sure ? we have regular sessions , too . only twenty dollars ?
you mean i am black ?
no , just not the type .
what do you mean , not the type ? do not you know who i am ? i am big dick brown ! i have been in more porno movies than you ever saw . i have worked with harry reems . i have worked with johnny wad . not the type ! i can come ten times a day . i can keep it hard two hours at a time . my cock is nine inches long .
i am sorry , mr . brown . i am sure you are very good , but at the moment , i have got nothing for you . if something comes up , we will give you a call .
shit ! you just do not want to hire a nigger , that is all . i knew this was a scam . i should nota come .
but is she , has . . .
there s no evidence of any foul play at present . i hope she is just a runaway .
there s something wrong here . kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave .
i said i hope she is a runaway . better that than she just disappears like so many others do . sometimes they turn up years later , sometimes not . a lot of crimes go unreported , unknown . these are realities .
what are you doing ?
two officers have been assigned to the case . i cannot keep them on indefinitely , but we will go through every lead .
you are going to thank me for this . you know what the media s like . they love this kinda shit . if that guy goes off half cocked and gets himself hurt , you are going to have so much bad publicity , you . . .
i heard you the first time . we had nothing to go on with this kid . just a runaway . do you really think he is in danger ?
if he has anything to say about it , yeah . i have been asking a lot of questions and i do not like the answers i am getting . he is made a lot of people nervous , including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star .
we are not gonna arrest him for that . . .
big threat . tv would ream you .
keep me informed of what he is up to . you help me , i will help you .
we offer female wrestling , that is , nude body to body contact , with a girl of your choice in a private room . twenty dollars a half hour , thirty dollars hour . any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room . tipping is permitted . we accept bank americard , master charge and american express .

you will be fine .
well , i want to . . .
sit down . make yourself comfortable . my name s felice .
you are not vice , are you ? do you work for the los angeles police department , or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency ?
no , i do not .
i have to ask you that . if you were vice you could not deny it . you ought to dress less square . you would not get hassled so much . here , let me help you get that tie off .
pull out your cock .
what ?
cops are not allowed to do that either . a judge ruled that that was entrapment . do not ask me why . i guess he figured the sight of a vice officer s dong would make a girl unable to stop herself .
are you going to stiff me ?
what do you mean ?
look , that twenty dollars you just paid , i do not get any of that . that goes to the guys that own this place . i get two bucks an hour , minus ten percent for a bail fund . i make all my money on tips .
you want a tip ?
sure . what do you want ? tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars .
what do you mean ?
what do you want to tip me for ? look , you got to spell it out . whatever you want , just say it .

that is charity . she is out back . she will be free in half hour .
i tried to get more , but this is the limit . the de vries line has the same area .
i like it , mr . van dorn .
do not you think it is a little too . . . bright ?
not really . but if you want me to tone it down . . .
no , no . i would not hire a display designer if i did not trust her taste . maybe we should bring in more of that shade . perhaps a stripe across the back wall .
yeah , overpowering . that was the word i was looking for .
mr . van dorn , i have worked on the color scheme for weeks . i think it is just right .
that is that shade of blue called ?
pavonine . it is the same tint as the stripe in the fabric .
sam ?
yeah . he is a nice guy . do not lose him . maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit . it is a little . . .
overpowering ?
yeah .
okay , mr . van dorn , i think we could knock that pavonine blue a bit .
are you sure it is all right ?
yes . i think it will look better .
if you say so .
yeah . how did you know ?
you kidding ? three days work . i finish tonight .
the other girl is the star ?
she thinks so . what do you do ?
i work with ramada . we are doing some pictures together .
well , next time you talk to him , tell him to pay his actresses more .
sure . like in mikey and niki . did you see that picture ?
no .
too bad . i was not in it .
i am making a film . jim sullivangs going to be in it . he said you might know where tod is .
do i know you ? were not you on the set the other night ? with ramada .
yeah .
you making a feature ?
um hm . live sound .
got any parts ? i am free . not free free , but , you know , free . i do not really do this .
you know her ?
no . i saw her with tod .
do you know where she lives ?
nah .
do you know where she would be ?
tod might know .
where is he ?
last i heard he went to san diego .
if we went there , would you be able to find him ?
you are not a film producer , are you ?
how much do you make a week , niki ?
something like that . how much do you make ?
here ? what a joke . there was some detective asking about that girl .
three hundred ?
this is just temporary . i once made nine hundred in outcall .
i will give you a week , cash , if you help me find this girl .
up front ?
half now , half later .
make it nine hundred . that was my best week .
okay . my client pays for it anyway .
when do we start ?
tonight . when you get out , we will go . why did not you tell the other detective ?
this is different . this is nine hundred dollars .
i am .
huh ?
niki . calm down . relax . let s just talk for a while . then , later , you will go back to your room and we will get some sleep .
i do not drink , but you can go out .
you do not drink ?
ulcers .
no .
i did not think so . i have fucked detectives . who are you ?
a friend .
of joanne s ?
yeah . i am her father .
jesus .
her name is kristen . she disappeared a couple of months ago .
and your wife ? where is she ?
she is dead .
hey , do not worry about it . your daughter s around . we will find her in a couple days .
at least i am a growing person .
you will not keep growing at this rate .
what rate ?
you know what i am talking about .
you never met a working girl before , have you ? you think i like sucking off guys all night ? maybe i do . so what ? you cannot even say it , can you ?
say what ?
sucking off .
okay . sucking off . now does that make me as good as you ?
you do not understand shit .
okay , tell me . why do you live like you do ?
did you ever live in a room with six people and you did not have any money , any food , any furniture ? have your brother come out , his car break down , he cannot get a job ? your friends stealing food , going through trash behind a supermarket ?
is that the way it was with you ?
no . but does it make any difference ? how did you get to be the way you are ?
you used to work at copper penny ?
no .
you and i , niki , have very different ideas about sex .
why ? are you a sex fiend ?
no .
neither am i .
but it is all you do .
how important do you think sex is ?
not very .
we are just alike . you think sex is so unimportant you do not do it . i think sex is so unimportant i do not care who i do it with .
what do you care about ?
i care about my daughter .
tijuana .
they were here ?
tod was . he was with ratan .
what does that mean ? what does he do ?
he deals in pain .
is kristen safe ?
christian reformed . it is a dutch calvinist denomination .
do they believe in reincarnation ? i believe in reincarnation .
they believe in the tulip .
what the crap ?
it is an anagram . it comes from the canons of dort . every letter stands for a different belief . t u l i p . like are you sure you are interested in this ?
yeah , yeah , go on .
t stands for total depravity , that is , all men , through original sin , are totally evil and incapable of good . all my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the lord .
shit .
fuck .
i can stop if you want .
no , please go on .
wait , wait . i am trying to figure this out . this is like rona barrett . before you become saved , god already knows who you are ?
he has to . that is predestination . if god is omniscient , if he knows everything and he would not be god if he did not then he must have known , even before the creation of the world , the names of those who would be saved .
so it is already worked out . the fix is in ?
more or less .
wow . then why be good ? either you are saved or you ai not .
out of gratitude for being chosen . that is where grace comes in . god first chooses you , then allows you , by grace , to choose him of your own free will .
you really believe all that ?
yeah . well , mostly .
i thought i was fucked up .
i will admit it is confusing from the outside . you have got to see it from the inside .
if you see anything from the inside it makes sense . you ought to hear perverts talk . a guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me .
it is not quite the same thing .
it does not make any sense to me .
why cannot i meet him now ?
where does he live .
just a second . it is my ass i am risking . you better do it my way . these fuckers do not mess around .
i know what you mean . after a while they all look the same .
they are the same .
do you live in a house back in wherever .
grand rapids ? of course .
on your own land ?
but what ?
i would not expect too much . i mean about her coming back . once a girl gets into the life .
what makes you so sure ?
you wife is not dead is she ?
just a guess . she ai not dead though is she ?
yeah . she was the one called joanne . how would you find that out ?
just a guess . did you have it good with your wife ? you know , sex .
do not get upset . i lied too . i do not make no five hundred dollars a week . everything i make goes to granville .
granville ?
my man . pimp . i split cause he do not treat me for shit . thinks he is so cool cause he is black . i once tried to take my clothes but he says , you cannot take em cause they are my clothes i bought em . yeah , with my fucking money . . .
so i guess we are both fucked , huh ? but at least you get to go to heaven . i do not get shit .
tod gave me the slip . i have to find him again . where does he live ?
what happened ?
where is he ?
i cannot tell you that .
but then you will forget about me .
where is he , niki ?
well , what do they know ?
dogshit . worse yet , they do not care .
so then , mr . mast . . .
andy .
. . . what do you have to offer ?
let me ask you a personal question , a painful one . the first of many . tell me , was your daughter the kind of girl to run around , to , ah , play practical jokes , maybe ?
if i was you , mr . mast , i would watch my language .
hey , i am a private detective , van dorn , you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to grand rapids . i have been to that scumbag town . it is full of them .
who s paying you ?
you are .
that is right .
as i was saying , i will pick up the thread . there s a number of ways i can go . there s not much you can do here . stay if you want . maybe it would be better if you went back home . go through kristengs personal stuff . ask around , maybe she knew somebody out here . look , i do this a lot . i work at a minimum rate of . a week . it may seem like a lot of money to you , but it ai not . you could hire cheaper .
and better ?
i suppose . but i will tell you , jake , i am like a little animal . when i get my teeth into something i never let go . if your daughter s here , i will track her down .
mr . van dorn ?
mast ?
yeah .
where are you ? the connection sounds very good .
i am back in grand rapids .
in g . r . ? why ?
can you meet me in about an hour ? at the pantlind hotel ?
i have got a meeting . . .
what are you paying me for ?
i will be there .
what have you found out ?
i have got some news . your daughter s all right . at least i think she is .
where is she ?
i do not know .
what do you mean ?
have you ever seen any , ah , pornographic movies , jake ?
no .
do you know what a hardcore movie is ?
that is like a stag film .
yeah . you ever seen any of those ?
no .
they are legal now .
they are ?
yeah . all over . even here in grand rapids .
hmm .
there s a little stall theatre up here . it is closed now , but i am borrowing it for an hour . i think there s something you would better see .
i do not know .
where did you get that film ?
who made it ?
i do not know .
what do you mean ?
that is it called ?
it was called slave of love when i bought it . next time it is sold , it will be called something else .
but the police . . .
the police ? they know less than you do .
do you think she is safe ?
yeah . probably .
you like this , do not you . showing me . . . this .
i hate it . but you gotta know , buddy . a lot of strange things happen in this world . things you do not know about in grand rapids . things you do not want to know about . doors that should never be opened . i have known more about this sort of thing than a man should . do not ask me why .
research , my ass . i suppose these are the extra expenses i have been paying for ? and in the middle of the morning , too .
get out . get out of here , goddammit .
get out .
but this is my apartment .
get out !
i felt like such a shit , pilgrim , after what i did to you not that i did anything wrong that i kept investigating , poking around . there s some poor s . o . b . in l . a . with his face all bent out of shape who you have damaged his movie career . lucky for him , people do not look at his face .
do the police want to arrest me ?
nah . they do not care about some faggot hustler . they are more interested in your daughter s health and yours . like i am .
yeah , sure .
listen , pilgrim , you are way out on a limb here . you do not know what you are into .
you sure as hell have not been any help .
i am sorry about that . have you found anything out ? you have got to tell me .
why do not you tell me something for a change ?
like what ?
who is ratan ?
i just heard . who is he ?
it is just a name .
do not do anything more . i will find out what i can .
does she know anything about this ?
who ? the whore ? no . she is just a victim . a dime a dozen .
just leave me alone .
but i am here to help you . . .
go home , pilgrim . there s nothing you can do . forget this place . start over .
no . thanks anyway . i have got to get over to the office .
anne wants to make sure you come over for dinner sunday . with kristen gone you will be all alone .
wes , anne , come here a moment .
they do not know . they were having some recreation deal out at knott s berry farm and kristen was not there when they got back to the bus and they could not find her .
yeah . she is quite upset . i am going to fly out today . they want me to bring some pictures .
i will come with you . let me pack some things .
pretty good .
you should come around more often . you have not been around for weeks . anne complains she does not see you anymore .
how did you find me ?
i called every l . a . hotel . the holiday inn gave this as a referral number . your office said you had no business in new york , so i figured you had come out here . that is happening , jake ? what are you doing ? nobody s heard from you . anne s worried sick . we did not know if you were dead or alive .
what ?
leave me alone . go home . go away .
what is going on ?
i think i have found a way to find kristen . i have a plan . but i have to be alone .
what plan ?
you do not want to know . now , wes , leave , please . for me .
what will i tell the others ? they care about you .
tell them anything you want . tell them i am on a vacation , a business trip . tell them i needed a rest . tell them anything , just do not tell them . . .

i do not know . look , man , if you are looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops .
but i . . .
i do not know nothing , man .
no .
that is all right .
no , take it . i do not want your goddamn fifty cents .
my secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition .
yes . i am interested in financing an adult feature film . i was told you were the man to come to .
film making can be pretty expensive . . .
oh . why is it that you want to get into film financing ?
well , bill mind if i call you bill ? let me be frank . i have made a lot of money . i have got my own business in detroit . rivets . i make rivets and sell them to fisher body . well , rivets , you know , can get pretty boring after a while . when my business manager told me i should shelter some money , i thought i would try this .
what exactly do you have in mind ?
i thought i would invest in a film . i want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film , meet the people who make films , learn how it is done . . .
in other words , you want to get laid ?
not exactly . . .
it is cool . why do you think i got in the movies ? how much poon do you think you get in the car wash business ? look , fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy . you can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars . so why fuck with the movie business ?
it is an investment .
if you want to watch when we shoot a film , for fifty bucks , i let guys stand around and watch . it is a lot cheaper .
i thought you were a businessman .
do not get me wrong . a couple years ago , i woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing . but the lord s been good to me . i can now finance any films i choose . big ones , small ones . right now we are setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film . live sound . i like to keep my own money in my films . that way you do not have to share the profits . there s plenty of guys in town that will take it , though . but if i was you , mr . . . what was your name again ?
jake .
. . . i would just start my own business . that is what i did . get into kid porn . that is big now . why do not you come around the set ? meet some people . if you still want to invest , i will ask around .
sounds all right .
okay . keep in touch with my secretary .
calm down , mister . you do not want to get the cops in here do you ? you got a family ?
i do not suppose you have ever seen this girl before either ? her name s kristen , but i suppose you have never seen her ?
why do not you just go outdoors , mister ? cool off .
cool off , huh ? how is this for cooling off ?
what do you think of that ? or this ?
he asked me . you going with anybody ?
i do not know .
you ever play chicken ?
that is that ?
you never heard of that ?
com on , tell me .
well , a boy goes like this , see .
well , each time he comes in closer , like this .
oh .
i am worried about jake .
i am off that case . he fired me .
he did not look good at all . something strange is going on . he is got himself into some trouble . he would not say what .
i will tell you , that was an interesting case . the van dorn girl . i have handled runaway cases like it before . usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid , she pops up in about a week . everybody denies ever seeing her , but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home . well , i put pressure on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice . in fact , certain people for this girl and nothing . i guess i gave your brother in law sort of a raw deal .
i have been on another case . all day . i suppose i can move it over . seven fifty a week , plus travel expenses .
do you really think kristen is just a runaway ?
i also want you to protect my brother in law .
huh ?
you have to understand . he can be mean , self righteous . he had a vishund once . loved that dog . he came home one day and the dog bit him . he took that dog and staked him out in the back yard . it was winter . every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze . he is capable of doing anything .
to his own daughter ?
to anybody .
my name ai not niki . it is pattica , like in attica .
granville s looking for you anyway .
who s that ?
the guy who bought you that ring .
well , he can just fuck himself .
you are taking a big chance .
i ai not ever gonna see him again anyway .
oh no ? what you gonna do ? get a job ?
who ? van dorn ? you must be kidding yourself , honey . you think once that guy finds his daughter he will care about you ?
you do not have to get uppity with me , bill . i remember when you was running that car wash and could not make it go . and what was that other thing you tried ? a dairy queen ? went busted too .
at least i improved myself . that is up ?
no , andy . do not know the kid .
look again , billy boy . this is jail bait . could get you in a lotta trouble .
nope never saw her before . kurt , come over here . do not use underage kids . would not touch em for all the cow shit in mexico . you recognize this piece of wool , kurt ?
you working in san diego now ?
i am still in l . a . , but i am looking for tod . i heard he was around .
was . he and that shitheel ratan went down to t j . maybe i should not say that . anyway , i hear he is back in frisco now .
was he with a girl ?
no .
thanks .
how do you do . i am mrs . chasen . come in .
yes , i am .
and what are you studying ?
poli . sci . with a home ec minor .
eh , poli sci ?
political science . it is all about that is going on .
yes , that is good planning . tell me , are you a regular , candy , in this computer club ?
oh , u yes u ? well , that is all right . i have got a brother who s a real cut up , too . i will never forget the time we had this old tv set with no parts in it . well , tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family . we were all hysterical . and here s little tommy pretending to be walter cronkite .
yes . those little pieces of paper with your picture on it ?
yes .
oh , i do not have one .
come again .
i do not have one . i do not believe in them .
how long have you been driving ?
about forty five minutes , would not you say , harold ? we were hoping to start sooner but , you see , it is rather hard to find a truck .
could i see your registration ?
i just do not think we have one , unless it is in the glove compartment . could you look , harold ?
is not this your vehicle ?
no , no . i just took it .
took it ?
yes . you see i have to plant my tree .
your tree .
well , it is not really mine . i dug it up in front of the courthouse . we are transplanting it . letting it breathe , you know . but , of course , we would like to get it into soil , as soon as possible .
lady , let me get this straight .
all right , then , and we will be off . nice chatting with you .
hello .
none of that , lady .
oh , well . must have been your brother .
out !
you too , buster . stand over here . lady , you are in a heap of trouble . i have you down here for several violations speeding , resisting arrest , driving without a license , driving a stolen vehicle , possession of a stolen tree . . . where is the tree ?
we planted it .
is this your shovel ?
no .
possession of a stolen shovel .
officer , i can explain .
lady , resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense . under the state criminal code , section , paragraph b . . .
oh , do not get officious . you are not yourself when you are officious . that is the curse of a government job .
lady , is it true you are driving without a license ?
check .
and that truck is it registered in your name ?
oh no ! not in u my u name .
then whose name is it registered in ?
well , i do not know . do you know , harold ?
where are the papers ?
i suppose they are in the truck . are you going to take a lot of time with this ?
wait here .
because if you are . . .
lady ! be quiet .
what kind of a car is it ?
edith , i would like you to meet my son , harold . harold , this is edith . . . eh ?
fern . i am very pleased to make your acquaintance .
i am a file clerk harrison feed and grain .
how interesting .
not very .
oh . well , what is it exactly that you do ?
i am in charge of all the invoices for the southwest . we supply , for example , most of the egg farmers in southern california . so you can imagine .
i am a file clerk .
yes . henderson feed and grain .
harrison . harrison feed and grain . . . at hamilton and fourth . . . i am in charge of the invoices . . . and i type up the schedule for the trucking fleet . . .
she supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed .
well , not all the southwest . although we do have a large business . . . barley was very big last week . . . fifteen hundred . . .
i am sorry . i was looking for maude .
a rather free translation but nonetheless correct . greetings to you too , my little one . tell me , what do you see ?
a block of ice .
exactly ! now , ask me what i see .
what do you see ?
i see the eternal goddess of beauty and love . i see aphrodite . the consummate woman .
what ? . . . oh yes . . . shovel . . . create . . . verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods . . . iliad . . . just sit down for a minute .
you are welcome . did you know him ?
eh , no .
me neither . i heard he was eighty years old . i will be eighty next week . a good time to move on , do not you think ?
i do not know .
i mean , seventy five is too early , but at eighty five , well , you are just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon .
eh , could i have my pen back now , please ?
oh , of course . what is your name ?
harold chasen .
how do you do ? i am dame marjorie chardin , but you may call me maude .
nice to meet you .
oh , thank you . i think we shall be great friends , do not you ?
no , thank you . i have my car .
well then , i must be off . we shall have to meet again .
what ?
do you sing and dance ?
eh , no .
no . i thought not .
oh , so do i . they are such fun , are not they ? it is all change . all revolving . burials and births . the end to the beginning and the beginning to the end the great circle of life . my , this old thing handles well . ever drive a hearse , harold ?
yes .
well , it is a new experience for me . good on curves . shall i take you home , harold ?
but this is my car .
your hearse ?
yearse !
oh .
and you get into any car you want and just drive off ?
not u any u car . i like to keep a variety . i am always looking for the new experience , like this one . i liked it .
thank you . but when you take these cars do not you think you are wronging the owners ?
what owners , harold ? we do not u own u anything . it is a transitory world . we come on the earth with nothing , and we go out with nothing , so is not ownership a little absurd ?
still , i think you would upset people and i am not sure that is right .
well , if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things , then i am merely acting as a gentle reminder i am sort of breaking it easy here today , gone tomorrow , so do not get attached to u things u . now , with that in mind , i am not against collecting stuff . . .
it is very interesting .
oh , look ! the birds .
thank you , but i really have to go .
but it is oat straw tea . you have never had oat straw tea , have you ?
no .
well then .
oh , at the dentist s ?
sort of .
well , then , you must come back and visit .
all right .
my door is always open .
all right .
promise ?
maude ? ? ? !
eh , fine .
i will heat some up . my , it is nice to see you again , harold . how is your hearse ?
oh , it is fine . fine .
she seemed yare to me .
heavens no ! i do not have the time . but i like to keep in practice and poor glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form . do you disapprove ?
me ! no . of course not .
really . do you think it is wrong ?
no .
oh , i am so happy you said that because i wanted to show you my paintings . this is the rape of rome and , of course , there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of leda and the swan .
yes . very much .
it was my last . i then became infatuated with these my odorifics .
subways . . . perfume . . . cigarette . . . . . . cologne . . . carpet . . . chestnuts ! . . . u snow ! u
it goes on and on .
that is really great .
oh . eh , i like it .
no , you have to touch it . you have to run your hands over it , get close to it , really reach out and feel . you try it .
certainly a new experience for me .
wonderful ! try something new each day . after all , we are given life to find it out . it does not last forever .
me . ha ! did i tell you i will be eighty on saturday ?
you do not look eighty .
that is the influence of the right food , the right exercise , and the right breathing . greet the dawn with the breath of fire ! of course , there s no doubt the body is giving out . i am well into autumn . i will have to be giving it all up after saturday . sweeten the tea with honey , harold . it is delicious .
that is a nice teapot .
sterling silver . it was my dear mother in law s , part of a dinner set of fifty pieces . it is one of the few things that survived . oh , but i do rattle on so . tell me about yourself , harold . what do you do when you are not visiting funerals ?
what do you mean ?
i do not know . just one of those .
because they are all the same .
oooh , but they are not . look .
oh , it is only a machine , harold . it is not as if it were u alive u , like a horse or a camel . we may live in a machine age , but i simply cannot treat them as equals . of course , the age has its advantages .
well . . .
look .
what ?
over there by the courthouse .
what is it ?
that little tree . it is in trouble . come on .
but what ?
we will transplant it . to the forest .
but we cannot just dig it up !
why not ?
but this is public property .
exactly .
yes , you are right . we will go see glaucus . come on .
oh , wait , maude . look !
is he all right ?
he is fallen asleep , as usual .
what is that he is working on ?
an ice sculpture . it is venus the goddess of love , the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream .
it is kind of rough .
he is never finished one yet . he has around him every kind of hand tool known to man , but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake .
look , the ice is melting .
yes .
well , i really do not drink . . .
oh , it is all right . it is organic .
some nuts ? some licorice ? it has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait .
thank you .
my umbrella ? oh , that is just a relic . i found it when i was packing to come to america . it used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition . a long time ago .
what were you fighting for ?
oh , big issues . liberty . rights . justice . kings died and kingdoms fell . i do not regret the kingdoms what sense in borders and nations and patriotism but i do miss the kings . when i was a little girl i was taken to the palace in vienna , to a garden party . i can still see the sunshine , the parasols , and the flashing uniforms of the young officers . i thought then i would marry a soldier . later , frederick would chide me about it . he was so serious . a doctor at the university . and in the government .
no more revolts .
oh , yes ! every day . but i do not need a defense anymore . i embrace ! still fighting for the big issues but now in my small , individual way . shall we have a song ?
well , i do not . . .
oh come on . i will teach you .
but i do not play anything .
do not play anything ! dear me . everyone should be able to make some music . why , it is life ! rhythm and harmony that is the cosmic dance . come with me .
superb .
is he ? ah , the police . always wanting to play games . well , here goes .
the old double u turn . gets them every time .
i do not know .
i suppose i did . well , farewell little tree . grow up tall , and change , and fall to replenish the earth . is not it wonderful , harold ? all around us . living things .
yeah . and it is cold in here . hello , glaucus .
yes . it is almost there .
yes .
do not you think we should turn off the heat ?
why ? there will be a new block of ice in the morning .
yes , so do i . but i think he is a little . . . old fashioned . like a puff , harold ?
well , i really do not smoke .
it is all right . it is organic .
i am sure picking up on vices .
vice ? virtue ? it is best not to be too moral . you cheat yourself out of too much life . aim above morality . as confucius says , do not simply be good . make good things happen .
did confucius say that ?
well they say he was very wise , so i am sure he must have .
you are the wisest person i know .
me ! when i look around me i know i know nothing . i remember though , once long ago in persia , we met a wise man in the bazaar . he was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay . his specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin . the wisest , he said , the truest , the most instructive words for all men at all times . frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel i peered through a magnifying glass to read the words and this too shall pass away . well , the wise man was right if you remember that , you cannot help but live life fully .
yes . i have not lived . i have died a few times .
what was that ?
died ! seventeen times not counting maiming . shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood .
how ingenious ! tell me about them .
well , it is a question of timing , and the right equipment , and plenty of patience . . . you really want to hear about this ?
of course .
okay .
i like you , maude .
i like you , harold . come , i will teach you to waltz .
it is so blue .
and beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos .
spreckled with uncountable stars . the stars are shining right now . we just cannot see them . just another instance of all that is going on that is beyond human perception .
maude , do you pray ?
pray ? no . i communicate .
with god ?
with life .
well , why do not you ?
no . i would feel stupid .
harold , everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves . you just cannot let the world judge you too much .
no . i feel more like yodeling .
yodeling ?
where is that ?
from the guys who got the matches , of course .
boy ! it sure has been a wonderful day . and you you are beautiful .
shall i drop by tomorrow ? oh , i have a luncheon date . with this girl .
oh .
i have never met her . my mother set it up .
well , be kind . i have lived a long time , harold , seen evil as well as good , and it has been my experience that kindness . . .
what is it , harold ?
they are going to draft me . in the army . i am going to be sent away .
but they cannot do that . you have not even got the vote .
but they have .
well , do not go .
really . just put it there , harold .
maude , do you think you can help me ?
what ? with your skill and my experience . . . i think we can come up with something .
traitor ! benedict arnold ! remember nathan hale , right , sir ?
. . . of you . you will all end up like this .
give me that . i am going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs .
she took my head .
no . it had nothing on this afternoon .
oh , you were not scared .
scared ? swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours . i was petrified .
come on , you loved it . it was a new experience .
right on ! it would not be a celebration without it .
well , they are my species .
yes . they are old friends .
do you think there is any life up there ?
i do not know . perhaps .
science thinks there is not . that we are all alone in the universe .
we u are u alone you and me and everybody . but we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in china is looking at them , too . someone we do not know and most likely will never see that someone is breathing along with us . and the star gazers of the past from peasant to princes and the star gazers of the future all of us breathing and looking up there . we are alone but look at the stars and never feel lonely .
you should have been a poet .
oh , no . but i should have liked to have been an astronaut . a private astronaut able to just go out and explore . like the men who sailed with magellan , i want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world . what a joke it will be if like them i
maude .
yes .
here .
i took them out .
why ?
they mocked me . they were representations of people i dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me , and that in time all i would have left would be vague feelings but sharp photographs ! so i tossed them out . my memory fades , i know . but i prefer pictures made by me with feeling , and not by kodak with silver nitrate .
i will never forget you , maude . but i would like a photo of you .
harold , that picture is almost twenty five years old .
you have not changed a bit . i will put it in my wallet .
you have never cried before . i never thought you would . i thought , despite anything , you could always be happy .
oh , harold . you are so young .
oh , you have thought of everything . and champagne .
it is all right . it is organic .
oh , harold .
for you .
oh , i am happy , harold . ecstatically happy . i could not imagine a lovelier farewell .
farewell ?
why yes . it is my eightieth birthday .
but you are not going anywhere , are you ?
oh yes , dear . i took the pills an hour ago . i should be gone by midnight .
maude , please . do not die . i could not bear it . please , do not die .
but , harold , we begin to die as soon as we are born . what is so strange about death ? it is no surprise . it is part of life . it is change .
but why now ?
i thought eighty was a good round number .
but maude , you do not understand . i love you . do you hear me ? i have never said that to anyone in my life before . you are the first . maude . please do not leave me .
oh , harold , do not upset yourself so .
it is true . i cannot live without you .
and this too shall pass away .
never ! never ! i will never forget you . i wanted to marry you . do not you understand ! i love you . i love you !
oh ! that is wonderful , harold . go and love some more .
please ! she has got to see a doctor right away .
well , not u dying u , actually . i am changing . you know , like from winter to spring . of course , it is a big step to take .
i have a sore throat .
well , i want you to go to bed directly after dinner . you know how susceptible you are to colds . harold has always been a delicate child . even as a baby he seemed to be abnormally prone to illness harold , dear , eat up your beets . . .
not now , harold . . . you cannot put me down for monday ?
mother .
harold , please ! i am on the phone .
mother . i am going to get married .
fay , i will call you back . what did you say ?
i am getting married .
to whom ?
to a girl . here .
what ?
a sunflower ?
at a funeral .
oh . . . that is wonderful . . . i get an eighty year old pallbearer for a daughter in law ! be reasonable , harold ! you are dealing with your life ! what will people say ? !
i do not care what people say .
you do not care ! miss shroud of weds the boy of a thousand deaths ! listen to me . . .
harold !
perhaps it is .
cannot complain .
no , thank you . they stain my fingers .
well , actually , it was the name of my drama teacher louis sunshine . perhaps you have heard of him . he was such an influence on the development of my instrument . that means my body in theatre talk . well , when i came to hollywood i felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form , so i took on sunshine . dore is my real name . . . well , dore , actually . my , what a lovely place you have here .
no . i am learning the banjo . do you ?
oh , i studied the guitar . i had to give it up . gave me calluses on my fingers . as an actress i cannot afford to have a tarnished instrument .
no . my uncle .
oh , he is in the army . i do so like the military , do not you ? those uniforms make men look so virile . i did what price glory ? in summer stock . i played charmaine with a french accent .
ohhh . that is hari kari ?
an ancient japanese ceremony .
like a tea ceremony ?
no . like this .
an accurate number would be difficult to gauge .
and why is that ?
well , some worked out better than others some had to be abandoned in the planning stages do you include the first time ? then there s the question of maiming . . .
just give me a rough estimate .
well , a rough estimate . . . i would say fifteen .
fifteen .
a rough estimate .
and were they all done for your mother s benefit ?
i would not say benefit .
no , i suppose not . how do you feel about your mother ?
does that worry you ?
yes . it does .
why ?
i put a lot of effort into these things .
ah , yes .
and a lot of time .
i am sure . but what else do you do with your time ? do you go to school ?
no .
what about the draft ?
my mother spoke to my uncle victor . he is in the army and he fixed it up .
oh . well , how do you spend your day ?
you mean when i am not working on a . . .
yes . what kind of things do you do ?
i do not know .
is it the machines ? the noise ? the people ?
no . it is the junk . i like to look at junk .
what else do you like ?
i go to funerals .
huh ?
you do not seem to be listening . i asked do you have any friends ?
no .
none at all ?
well , maybe one .
would you care to talk about this friend ?
no .
is this a friend you had when you were away at school ?
no .
i see . were you happy at school , harold ?
yes .
you liked your teachers ?
yes .
your classmates ?
yes .
your studies ?
yes .
then why did you leave ?
i burnt down the chemistry building .
yes .
very well . now your mother tells me she is arranging several dates for you with some young ladies . how do you feel about that ?
no . i would have liked to .
why ?
i would have liked to talk to him .
what would you say ?
i would show him my hearse . and my room , and stuff .
what kind of stuff ?
thank you , uncle .
call me sir , harold . first thing you learn in the army an officer deserves your respect .

during wartime the national suicide rate goes down .
is that a fact ? well , that fits in right along with everything i have been saying . war is not all black .
war is not all black .

well , you will soon have stories like that to tell of your own .
you think so , sir ?

i hope so , sir . golly i never knew it could be so exciting .
it is the greatest excitement in the world .
to pit your own life against another .
that is right .
to kill . the taste of blood in your mouth .
the moment of truth .
another mangs life in your sights .
yes .
zat !
oh , sure . a variety of weapons .
and to use the bayonet ? pachoie !

i would like that . you could see the blood squirt out .
harold , i think you are getting carried away here .

we are leaving .
where is my father ?

it will go in .
do you really need this bed , lady ?
uh huh .
got her mother s looks .
her mother s dead .
julia s my second wife .
lucky man .
damn right . now are we going to move the bed or not ?
it is just a puzzle box .
it is a means to summon us it is called the lament configuration .
who are you ?
cenobites . explorers in the further regions of experience . demons to some . angels to others .
well , i did not mean to open that thing . you can go back wherever you came from .
you solved the box . we came . now you must come with us . taste our pleasures .
no !
no tears please . it is a waste of good suffering .
you did this before , right ?
many times .
to a man called frank cotton ?
he did . i have seen him .
i could lead you right to him . you could take him back to hell instead of me .
no . that was not the deal .
stay the fuck away from me .
you can keep them .
i have to speak to my father .
that is easily arranged . but first , back into bed .
it is important .
you took quite a beating . you must lie down .
first things first . you can have a telephone when we have talked . do you know who did this to you ?
i do not remember .
well the police are going to want to speak to you . you know that .
oh christ .
we will get you a phone as long as you promise to stay put .
kirsty ?
no .
you remember .
no .
come to daddy .
what ? what will you do ? what can you do ? there s nothing to be frightened of .
this is not happening .
i used to tell myself that . used to try and pretend i was dreaming all the pain . but why kid yourself ? some things have to be endured . take it from me . and that makes the pleasures so much sweeter . . .
one last time . give me the box .
you want it ?
this is not happening .
some things have to be endured . . .
do not mourn him . he was dead long before we laid a finger on him .
poor baby .
bastard .
hush now . it is all right frank s here .
frank
that is right . this is frank you are talking to , remember ? frank .
that is right . who are you ?
i am brother frank .
oh .
i came for the wedding .
oh . oh yes .
well can i come in or not ?
i am sorry . of course . you are very welcome .
i do not want to see the dress .
but you said
i do not want to see the dress .
forget him .
i am very happy .
sure you are .
oh my god .
do not look at me .
who are you ?
i said do not look .
tell me who you are .
frank .
believe me . it is me . it is really me .
what happened to you ?
his blood . . . on the floor . . . it brought me back .
back from where ?
just help , will you ? please god , help me
ssh !
what do you want me to do .
the blood brought me this far . i need more of the same . or i will slip back . . .
hurting .
my nerves . . . are beginning to work again .
good .
one more . maybe two
who ?
the cenobites . it is only a matter of time before they find i have slipped them . i have to get away from here .
keep your voice down .
you are hurting .
you will not cheat me will you ? you will stay with me . help me . then we can be together , the way we were before . we belong to each other now , for better or worse . . .
better . very much better . i would like something to wear . and some cigarettes . will you bring me some ?
later .
what ?
i want an explanation first . i want to know what happened to you .
not know .
tell me , damn you .
you promised me an explanation .
a box ?
it is not any box . it is called the lament configuration . it is a puzzle .
let me see .
do not touch it . it is dangerous . it opens doors .
what kind of doors ?
to experience beyond anything ever known . at least that is what i was promised when i bought it . pleasure from heaven or hell . i did not much care which .
hell . . .
i was bored . i would done everything . i would gone to the limits . there was nothing left to experience . at least nothing i could buy on earth .
and you came back here to solve the puzzle
sure . somewhere safe . safe . christ ! they tortured me here . in this room .
who did ?
the cenobites . the creatures the box set free . sometimes i think they are still here . just behind the walls . them and their hooks and their beasts . just waiting to break out again . except that i have got the box .
you are still afraid .
you would be . they tore me apart .
so you were cheated .
no . they gave me experiences beyond the limits . pain and pleasure , indivisible .
and the blood let you out ?
it gave me a little chance , and i took it . they will not get me back . i am going to live , and you are going to help me . yes ?
yes . they will never find us .
i do not .
so where is the harm ?
i said no .
then find me somebody else , before they come looking .
i do not think so . she will want larry first .
that is probably her now . or the police .
maybe .
do not you care ?
there s very little i can do about it .
maybe we should just leave
like this ? look at me ! like this ?
well we cannot just stay here
i need a skin . then we leave
hi . i got soaked .
there s a towel in the bathroom .
which is where ?
just to your left .
just an accident . he is all right . will you drive ? he needs stitches .
sure .
the keys are in the kitchen .
where is daddy ?
that is the problem ?
i have to see my father .
of course . there s no need to shout .
i was here this afternoon .
this afternoon .
i saw everything .
i am sorry , i do not follow . what was there to see ?
oh my god .
we are going to freeze to death .
o . k . o . k .

just a thought
ah !
it is just been empty a while .
the best part of ten years .
i do not know . probably wanted a hideaway .
we will sell it . sell everything .
i thought half of it was your brother s ?
he will not complain . he can pay off some of his creditors .
you mean we are moving in ?
no . i am not .
you wanted to come back to london . we came back .
so that is the argument ?
no argument .
oh christ . julia . . .

why not ?
we will move in sunday .
it looks like a bomb s dropped .
i cut myself .

let me see .
i am going to throw up .
no , you are not .

long time ago . i was just thinking about her . i was her first boyfriend .
i hate to quibble with you rob , but she married her first boyfriend . kevin bannister .
you gotta be kidding me .
that is right . kevin . she is mrs . kevin bannister . she lives in australia .
i beg your pardon ?
technically , i am number one . i went out with her a week before kevin did . her first boyfriend . me .
it will not go any louder .
i do not want to hear public enemy right now .
public enemy ! all i am trying to do is cheer us up . go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if i care .
i do not want old sad bastard music either . i just want something i can ignore .
but it is my new tape . my monday morning tape . i made it last night just for today .
yeah , well it is fucking monday afternoon . you should get out of bed earlier .
do not you want to hear that is next ?
that is next ?
play it .
say it .
little latin lupe lu .
since when did this shop become a fascist regime ?
since you brought that bullshit tape in .
great . that is the fun of working in a record store . playing crappy pap you do not want to listen to . i thought this tape was going to be , you know , a conversation stimulator . i was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a monday morning and all that , and you just had to ruin it .
we will do it next monday .
well that is the point in that ?
rob . top five musical crimes perpetrated by stevie wonder in the s and s . subquestion is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter day sins ? is it better to burn out than to fade away ?
you just drove a fucking customer away , barry .
we did not even really have it . i happen to know for a fact that the only stevie wonder single we have is do not drive drunk . i was just goofing on the straight , and it never cost you a penny .
not the point .
oh , so that is the point then ?
i do not want you talking to our customers like that again .
our customers ? you think that mr . l . l . bean out there is going to be a regular ?
bullshit . the guy was going to buy one record which we did not even have and leave and never come back again anyway . why not have a little fun ? big fucking deal .
what did he ever do to you ?
he offended me with his terrible taste .
it was not even his terrible taste . it was his daughter s .
oh , now you are defending that motherfucker ? you are going soft in your old age , rob . there was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street . now all of a sudden i am offending your golf buddy . you are right , rob . i am so sorry . how are we ever going to make enough money to get you and laura into the country club ?
but now i kind of like it .
i wanna live with a musician . she would write songs at home , ask me what she thought of them , maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes .
. . . maybe a picture of me in the liner notes . . .
i did not know it was classified information . i mean , i know we do not have any customers , but i thought that was a bad thing , not , like , a business strategy .
that is fucking great , barry . we can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each . fantastic , barry !
we can take your car .
it is not my car , now is it ? it is laura s car , and thus laura has it . so it is an ass bumping double transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab . wow . fucking great .
what do you mean , what ?
what are you snickering about ?
i am not snickering . i am smiling . because i am happy .
what am i missing ? what do you have to be happy about ?
ehh .
thunder road , bruce springsteen , from born to run . smells like teen spirit , nirvana , nevermind .
oh no , rob , that is not obvious enough . not at all . dick , did you hear that ?
shut up . let s get it on , marvin gaye , from let s get it on . airbag , radiohead , from ok computer .
ooh ! a kind of recent record ! rob s sly declaration of new classic status slipped into a list of old classics ! nice ! let s get it on ? could not you make it more obvious than that ?
you are like a little squirrel of music , storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music , musical lint , old shit , shit , shit
barry , if i were to say to you i have not seen evil dead ii yet , what would that mean ?
to me , it would mean that you are a liar . you saw it twice . once with laura oops once with me and dick . we had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off screen in the fourteenth century .
yeah , yeah , i know . but say i had not seen it and i said to you , i have not seen evil dead ii yet , what would you think ?
no , but would you think , from that one sentence . that i was going to see it ?
i am sorry , rob , but i am struggling here . i do not understand any part of this conversation . you are asking me what i would think if you told me that you had not seen a film that you have seen . what am i supposed to say ?
just listen to me . if i said to you
i have not seen evil dead ii yet , yeah , yeah , i hear you
would you . . . would you get the impression that i wanted to see it ?
well . . . you could not have been desperate to see it , otherwise you would have already gone . . .
but in your opinion , would i definitely go ?
how the fuck am i supposed to know that ? you might get sick of people telling you you have really gotta go see the movie .
because it is a brilliant film . it is funny , violent , and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass .
let s pack it up . we have not had a customer in four hours .
ha .
how do you know about that ?
oh come on , rob . what am i , an idiot ? i am more bothered by dick s thing . how did this happen , dick ? what rational explanation can there possibly be ? that is her name ?
yeah , you would say that , would not you ? you two have to stick together now . boners united . united in getting some .
suck my ass .
terrific .
what the fuck is that ?
my band .
what band ?
the band that found me and asked me to join .
you are not in a band , barry . you are not a musician . and no posters .
thanks for your support , rob . really appreciate it .
barrytown . barrytown ? is there no end to your arrogance ?
i did not make up the name . it is the steely dan song . and it was in the commitments .
you cannot be called barry and sing in a group called barrytown .
they were fucking called that before i was in it , okay ? it was not my idea .
that is why you got the gig , is not it ?
that was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally , yes . but
great ! that is fucking great ! they only asked you to sing because of your name ! you can stick it above the browser racks over there .
how many tickets can i put you down for ?
none . christ !
you are not even coming ?
of course i am not coming . do i look like i would want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave ? where is it ? the fucking bucktown pub ? ha !
so much for friends , then . you are a bitter bastard , rob , you know that ?
bitter ? because i am not in barrytown ? you should be shot like a lame horse , you jerk . just keep that out of my window .
laura . her dad died .
ooh . drag .
whatever . okay . tell laura i love her . that would bring the house down . laura s mom could sing it .
fuck off , barry .
i would want one step beyond by madness . and you cannot always get what you want .
because it is in the big chill .
have not seen it .
liar . we saw it in the lawrence kasdan double bill with body heat .
oh . right . but i would forgotten about that . i was not biting the idea .
not really .
no way .
yes way . it is really . . .
what ?
i heard you , man . do not give me that what shit . you just told them that you are gonna put out a record with them .
so ? you even said they are good .
hello . do you see anyone else around here with a band , mr . branson ? mr . phil spector ?
laura said we could . if we helped out with the posters and stuff . and we did . and we are .
i will give you of the door if you do not play .
we are getting that anyway .
what is she doing ? okay , .
no . we need the gig .
. that is my final offer . i am not kidding . that is how much it means to me not to hear you play .
we are not as bad as you think , rob .
you could not be . look , barry . there s going to be people from laura s work there , people who own dogs and babies and tina turner albums . how are you going to cope with them ?
we are not called barrytown anymore , by the by . they got sick of the barry barrytown thing . we are called sdm . sonic death monkey .
sonic death monkey .
what do you think ? dick likes it .
barry , you are over thirty years old . you owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called sonic death monkey .
i owe it to myself to go right to the edge , rob , and this group does exactly that . over the edge , in fact .
you will be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next friday night .
that is what we want . reaction . and if laura s bourgeois lawyer friends cannot take it , then fuck em . let em riot , we can handle it . we will be ready .
oh yeah . we got it .
no , you cannot .
because it is sentimental tacky crap , that is why not . do we look like the kind of store that sells i just called to say i loved you ? go to the mall and stop wasting our time .
that is your problem ? what did i . . . why are you
do you even know your daughter ? there is no way she likes that song . or is she in a coma ?
i have all of the others .
oh really . well what about the first jesus and mary chain ?
they always seemed . . .
they always seemed what ? they always seemed really great , is what they always seemed . they picked up where your precious echo left off , and you are sitting here complaining about no more echo albums . i cannot believe that you do not own that record . that is insane .
do not get ahead of yourself .
i have a television .
no !
it is the new
no . the righteous brothers .
oh well . nevermind .
nothing .
no , not nothing . that is wrong with the righteous brothers ?
nothing . i just prefer the other one .
bullshit .
is not her album called number four with a smile ?
that is what i said .
no , no , no , you said the number four with a smile , and there s no the at the front of the title of the album .
it is a reference to a chinese meal in toronto and i think that there is a the . but i could be wrong .
you can be and are wrong .
on clark street !
a couple blocks ! about six !
we work there !
you would love it !
why ?
nobody .
anna who ? anna green gables ? anna conda ?
anna moss .
anna moss . mossy . the mossy thing . the swamp thing . is she all green and furry ?
he is not worth it !
did you know that after that song was recorded , jan himself crashed his
it was dean , you fucking idiot .
no . no . mom wants you to come to the funeral . it is on friday .
oh , hi .
where is rob ?
the malcolm mcclaren of clark street is in his executive suite . do you have an appointment ?
what are you talking about ?
just that rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business crippling nazi youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary . that is all .
i am looking for deejay rob gordon .
uh . that is me .
i am caroline fortis from the reader . i want to do a story on you .
right . why ?
well , i used to go to the dodger on your nights , and i saw you are doing it again and that your putting out a record , and it is sort of a then and now story against the backdrop of the chicago music scene with the emphasis on now .
oh . okay .
i thought i would ask you a few questions if that is okay .
huh . you used to come to the club ? i should not have let you in . you must have only been about sixteen .
so . is now a good time ?
yeah . i could show it to you if you want to come over and see it .
pardon me ?
your desert island top five .
oh boy . . . in the club , or at home ?
is there a difference ?
of course . . . well yeah , a bit . sin city by the flying burrito brothers is an all time top five , but i would not play it at the club . it is a country rock ballad . everybody would go home .
nevermind . any five . so four more .
what do you mean , four more ?
well if one of them is this sin city thing
can i go home and work this out and let you know ? in a week or so ?
look if you cannot think of anything , it does not matter . i will do one . my five favorite from the old days at the dodger .
fine . that is great .
is that it ?
well , i would not mind a quick chat , if you got the time .
sure , but is that it for the list ?
that is five . so . why did you decide to deejay again ?
well it was a friend s idea , really , and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it . so . . . i should really put a james brown in there
nice friend .
yeah .
that is his name ?
who ? oh . my friend . my friend is laura . a girl . a friend who s a girl .
music for old people . what does that mean ?
look , i am sorry about this , but i would like the upsetter by lee scratch perry , in there . instead of sin city .
oh , you know . . . a lot of people are not too old for clubs but they are too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that . they want to hear old funk and stax and new wave and old school hip hop and some new stuff all together and there s nowhere for them .
and the new label ? and the kinky wizards ?
oh , well , the kinky wizards are you know what ? why do not i just make you a tape ?
would you ? really ? wow . i could have deejay rob gordon play in my own home .
haha . right . it is no problem . i love making tapes .
yeah , sure . . .
good . great . yeah . . . wow . rob gordon . seems like a million years ago now .
yeah . a billion . right . . . how are you ?
fantastic but i am a little busy right now . listen . do you want to come to dinner saturday ? i am having some friends over and i need a spare man . are you a spare man ?
uh . . . yes , at the moment .
great . gotta go . see you then .
hey rob .
why did you break up with me for marco ?
fuck ! i knew it ! you are going through one of those what does it all mean things .
huh ?
there s been a rash of them , recently . i find it a little unnerving . in fact marco called a few months back , and he wanted to see me , and rehash the past as they say , and i was not really up for it . do all men go through this ?
c mon , just answer the question . you can say what you like . what the hell ?
did you tell that to marco when he did his what does it all mean thing with you ?
oh god , no . i did not want to hurt his feelings .
oh , hi . hi , rob .
good weekend ?
yeah , ok . i found the first licorice comfits album at vintage vinyl . the one on testament of youth . never released here . japanese import only .
great .
i will tape it for you .
no , that is okay . really .
cause you like their second one , you said , pop , girls . etc . the one with cheryl ladd on the cover . you did not see the cover though .
yeah , i have not really absorbed that one .
well , i will just make it for you .
okay .
the new belle and sebastian . like it ?
can i help you ?
yeah . i am sorry . . . look dick , laura and i broke up . she is gone . and if we ever see barry again maybe you can tell him that .
course i will , rob . no problem . no problem at all . i will tell him next time i see him .
fine .
i will start with your news before i tell him mine , obviously . mine is not much , really , just about marie lasalle playing at lounge ax tonight . i like her , you know , she is kind of sheryl crowish . . . but , you know , good . so i will tell him before that . good news and bad news kind of thing .
i understand , dick .
sure . course . rob , look . do you want to . . . talk about it , that kind of thing ?
yeah .
i want a tape .
liz , hold on a second what ?
marie lasalle is in the store ! here , she is here , and now !
fuck off !
do it . do it .
yeah but more than that . i am happy because i am proud of us . because although our talents are small and peculiar , we use them to their best advantage .
yeah . . . well . . . i will see you tomorrow , rob .
you are a horrible person , barry . i mean it .
abraham , martin , and john . that is a nice one .
it is vince and justin .
who s that ?
i am fine . . . i gotta go . goodbye .
you look upset .
i am upset , but i am fine .
maybe i should talk to him .
mmmm , no . not a good idea .
conflict resolution is my job , laura .
nothing to resolve , ian . let s get a drink .
hello , rob . remember me ? i am ray . ian .
come on , rob . my relationship with laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal .
funnily enough i have not been too thrilled about it .
we are not talking jokey understatement here , rob . we are talking actionable harassment . ten phone calls a night , hanging around outside my house . . .
yeah , well , i have stopped all that now .
we have noticed and we are glad . but , you know . . . how are we going to make peace here ? we want to make things easier for you . what can we do ? obviously i know how special laura is , and i know things cannot be good for you at the moment . i would hate it if i lost her . but i would like to think that if she decided she did not want to see me anymore , i would respect that decision . do you see what i am saying ?
yeah .
good . so shall we leave it at that then ?
i dunno .
think about it , rob .
i have already left it , you pathetic rebound fuck ! now get your patchouli stink out of my store .
we will not leave it , ian . not ever .
i dunno .
think about it , rob .
we have done the hard part now . i might as well , you know . . .
well stay for tonight , then .
i should be so lucky .
hi .
hi .
i thought i could give you a lift back .
are you coming home ?
yes . well , i am coming over to your house to get some things .
my house ?
it is not like saying that at all , actually , rob . art garfunkel and marvin gaye make pop records
made . made . marvin gaye is dead , his father shot him in
whatever , and the israelis and the palestinians do not . art garfunkel and marvin gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute , and the israelis and the palestinians are . art garfunkel and marvin gaye
alright , alright but
and who says i like marvin gaye , anyway ?
is that right ? i would like a word with him .
but do not you remember ?
i remember the song . i just could not remember who sang it .
well , i liked you . you were a deejay , and i thought you were hot , and i did not have a boyfriend , and i wanted one .
so you were not interested in music at all ?
yeah , sure . more so then than i am now . that is life though , is not it ?
you really believe that ?
and do you like it that way ?
not really .
do not you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection ?
i think you know that .
had to work it out for myself , though , did not i ?
good . so . is it my job ?
what ? gimme a fucking break . is that what you think ? that your not big enough a deal for me ? jesus , gimme a little credit , rob .
i do not know . it is one of the things i thought of .
what were the others ?
just the obvious stuff .
that is the obvious stuff ?
i do not know .
no .
what , what ?
no . so . is it working out with ian ?
rob . do not be childish .
why is that childish ? your living with the guy ! i am just asking how it is going .
i am not living with him . i have just been staying with him for a few days until i work out what i am doing . look , this has nothing to do with anyone else . you know that , do not you ? i left because we were not exactly getting along , and we were not talking about it . and i suddenly realized that i like my job , and i like what my life is could be turning into , and that i am getting to a point where i want to get my shit together and i cannot really see that ever happening with you , and yeah , yeah , i sort of get interested in someone else , and that went further than it should have , so it seemed like a good time to go . but i have no idea what will happen with ian in the long run . probably nothing .
well then why do not you quit it while you seem to not be ahead ?
so , what , you have not definitely decide to dump me ? there s still a chance we will get back together ?
i do not know .
well , if you do not know , there s a chance , right ? it is like , if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said , i do not know if he is got a chance of survival or not , then that does not mean the patient s definitely going to die , now does it ? it means he might live . even if it is only a remote possibility .
i suppose so .
so we have a chance of getting back together again .
oh , rob , shut up .
hey , i just want to know where i stand . what chance
i do not fucking know what chance you fucking have !
okay , okay , we have a nine percent chance of getting back together . does that clarify the situation ?
yeah . great .
i am too tired for this now . i know i am asking a lot , but will you take off for a while so i can get my stuff packed up ? i need to be able to think while i do it and i cannot think while you are here .
no problem . if i can ask one question .
fine . one .
it sounds stupid .
nevermind .
you will not like it .
just ask it !
is it better ?
is what better ? better than what ?
well . sex , i guess . is sex with him better ?
jesus christ , rob . is that really that is bothering you ?
of course it is .
you really think it would make a difference either way ?
i do not know .
well the answer is that i do not know either . we have not done it yet .
never ?
i have not felt like it .
but not even before , when he was living upstairs ?
no . i was living with you , remember ? we have slept together but we have not made love . not yet . but i will tell you one thing . the sleeping together is better .
the sleeping together is better but not the sex because you have not done it was him yet .
will you please just go ?
hi . i have been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and i am thinking i did not take them with me . have you seen them around ?
i will look for em . how you doing ?
i am sorry to call , but i need that stuff . . .
fine , i am sure it is in the file at home . i will call you when i find it , and then we will talk .
we will talk some other time .
great . . . that is great .
have you slept with him yet ?
i told you i slept with him .
no , not i mean have you , you know
is that why you wanted to see me ?
i guess .
oh , rob . what do you want me to say ?
i want you to say that you have not , and i want it to be the truth .
you must have known it would happen . you could not have been entirely unprepared . like you said , i have been living with the guy . we were bound to get around to it sometime .
nothing .
we can meet for another drink if you want . so i can explain it better . i owe you that much .
look , i gotta go . i work too , you know .
will you call me ?
i do not have your number .
call me at work . we can arrange to meet properly . i do not want this to be the last conversation we have . i know what you are like .
you do , huh .
it is me .
i figured it was . where are you ?
i think the big question here is where are you , if you do not mind my saying so , and i think i know where you are . you are running . on the run . you are running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship , and you are just going to hit it again with ian but it is going to be with a world music bunny rabbit looking earth shoe wearing doctor who watching twit who does not really understand you , not the way that i do and will more in the future , and you will have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you are in now , only later . and with . . . him .
i am not hold on . . .
jesus . i do not know . i will talk to you later .
think about what i said . i mean , if you want to experiment , or whatever
i am not experimenting . why do not you go experiment .
i do not want to . do not need to . i love you .
you do not ever think about other people ?
no . . . not really . . . i mean , i think about it . . . but no , i do not really think about it .
is that the last of it ?
yep . i might have missed some stuff . i am so used to some things being here that i do not even notice them .
those look heavy . where is ian ?
he is at home . listen , i cannot believe he went to the store . i am mortified , actually . i am really sorry . he had no right to do that , and i told him so .
it was kind of funny .
you still together ? going all right ?
i do not really want to talk about it , to be honest .
that bad , eh ?
you know what i mean .
i will bet you cannot remember what you were doing here , can you ? i mean , how much are you making now ? sixty ? seventy ? and you were living in this shitty place .
you know i did not mind . and it is not as if ray s place is any better .
i am sorry , but can we get this straight ? what is his fucking name , ian or ray ? what do you call him ?
ray . i hate ian .
i hate him too . so i just call him mavis . or sissyboy . or mavis the sissyboy .
you make me laugh much more than ray does , if that is what you are getting at . but i already knew you could make me laugh . it is everything else i do not know about .
you know i am a good person .
mmm hmm .
you know that i can cook my ass off when i feel like it .
oh ho , so very infrequently .
those are not mine .
sure they are .
they are not really , though , are they ? i know you bought them for me , and that was really sweet of you , but that was when you were trying to turn me into you . i cannot take them , i know they would just sit around staring at me , and i would feel embarrassed by them and . . . they do not fit in with the rest of that is mine , do you understand ? that sting record you bought for me . . . that was a present for me . i like sting and you hate him . but the rest of this stuff . . . who the hell is nick lowe ? or gram parsons ? or the boredoms ? i do not know these people . i . . .
okay , okay . i get the picture .
i am sorry to go on about it . but , i do not know , there s a lesson here somewhere , and i want to make sure you get it .
i got it . you like sting but you do not like gram parsons , because you have never heard of him .
you are being deliberately obtuse .
i guess i am .
well , think about it .
hey , how ya doing ?
i cannot talk right now .
god , that is a cold and a half . maybe you should bet back in bed .
pigsty .
do not worry about it . just get into bed . worry about that when you are better .
pig died .
who the fuck s pig ?
my dad died . my dad , my dad .
no , no . when are you going home ?
in a minute . when i get it together .
my dad liked you . and mom never told him we would split , because he was not up to it and . . . oh , i do not know . i do not really understand it . i think she thinks he will be able to see that is going on . it is like . . . he is been through so much , what with dying and everything , that she does not want to upset him any more than she has to .
do you want me to be there ?
i do not care . as long as you do not expect me to hold your hand .
yes , of course .
liz will give you a lift . she knows where to go and everything . . . i do not have time to talk , rob . i have got too much to do .
sure . i will see you on friday .
uh . . . no .
mmnn .
you are also an idiot .
thank you . i appreciate it . i cannot reciprocate .
what do you mean ?
i did not mess things up because i was scared . i slept with ray because i was sick of you . and i needed something to snap me out of it .
sure , i understand . look , i do not want to take up any more of your time . you get back , and i will wait here for a bus .
i do not want to go back .
what do you want to do ?
c mon .
i do not know . sometime . later . listen , rob , would you have sex with me ?
what ?
i want to feel something else than this . it is either that or i go home and put my hand in the fire . unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm .
i have only got a couple left . i am saving them for later .
it will have to be sex , then .
hi .
i knew there was a reason i wore a skirt today .
oh , rob , we are not going to go through that again .
no , no . it is not . . . are you still on the pill ?
yes , of course . there s nothing to worry about .
i did not mean that . i mean . . . was that all you used ?
i lived with you . you were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you are worried i might kill you , and you are entitled to worry . is not that a terrible thing ? is not that sad ?
i am too tired not to go out with you .
everything s too hard . maybe another time i would have the guts to be on my own , but not now i do not .
what about ian ?
ray s a disaster . i do not know what that was all about , except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade , i guess , and blow it all apart .
mission accomplished .
i know it is not very romantic , but there will be romance again at some stage , i am sure . i just . . . i need you , rob . that is it . and we know each other and we care for each other , and you have made it clear that you want me back , so . . .
okay .
want to know what , exactly ?
what it was like .
it was like sex . what else could it be like ?
was it like good sex or was it like bad sex ?
that is the difference ?
you know the difference .
look , we are okay now . we just had a nice time . let s leave it at that .
okay , that is cool , okay . but the nice time we just had . . . was it nicer , as nice , or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago ?
well i was gonna lie and now i cannot , because you would know i was lying .
well why the fuck would you want to lie , anyway ?
to make you feel better .
oh , great . . .
okay .
hey , great idea . what i will do is , tomorrow i will get a hold of a box full of mint elvis presley s on the sub label , and i will pay for it that way .
i will pay for you . even though you owe me money . we have to do something with the money i earn . i need to . i deserve it . you can just think of it as winning the lottery .
fantastic . the girlfriend lottery .
money does not matter . i do not care how much you earn . i would just like you to be a little happier in your work , but beyond that you can do what you like .
but it was not supposed to be like this . when i met you we were the same people and now we are not , and . . .
how ? how were we the same people ?
well , you were the kind of person who came to the artful dodger and i was the kind of person who deejayed at the artful dodger . you wore jeans and t shirts , and so did i . and i still do , and you do not .
because i am not allowed to . i still do , after work . so , what ? should we just break up ? is that what you are saying ? because if you are , i am going to run out of patience .
no , but . . .
but what ?
but why does not it matter that we are not the same people we used to be ?
you have not changed so much as a pair of socks in the years i have known you . if we have grown apart , then i am the one who s done the growing , and all i have done is change jobs .
and hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and . . .
i cannot go to work with my hair dyed pink . and i can afford to go shopping more now , and i have met a couple people i like over the last year or so .
you are tougher .
more confident , maybe .
harder .
less neurotic . are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life ?
i am alright .
yeah , you are alright . but you are certainly not happy . so what happens if you get happy ? and yes i know that is the title of an elvis costello album , i use the reference deliberately to catch your attention . should we split up because i am used to you being miserable ? what happens if you , i do not know , start you are own record label , and it is a success ? time for a new girlfriend ?
you are being stupid .
how ? what would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice ?
no use .
hi . what are you doing ?
nothing .
wanna go to dinner ?
where ?
at paul and miranda s . paul from work .
oh . well . we do not really get along . paul and i .
i know . but you have never met . it just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him .
ha .
i tricked you into meeting some people you would think were great . i thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a tina turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way .
has drag city records , i know , i know . you told dan koretzky about this ?
yeah , and he said it is a good way to break out a record . especially for what he said , and i quote , would be a highly anticipated event , locally . he helped me put out a press release .
what ?
just local , of course .
and the triumphant return of dj rob gordon ? triumphant ? return ?
i had that idea when i was living with ian and it was such a good idea that i was annoyed we were not together anymore . it might even be why i came back .
you had no right . supposing i was doing something that could not be cancelled ?
what do you ever do that cannot be cancelled ?
that is not the point . i mean , what if the single is not done in time ?
barry said its done .
barry ? barry knows about this ?
yeah . his band is playing a set .
it is no joke . i am responsible for what happens , you know . embarrassment aside , there s a lot of money and effort in this , at least by my standards . i have to put down a deposit for the room . i have to pay the pressing plant for the records , sleeve them , sticker them
we took care of that .
that is okay . you seem pissed off all the time , though .
i know . i do not get it .
not really .
i am going to talk to you .
right .
i am going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not . to me .
ha ha ha . hoo hoo hoo .
i mean it .
i know .
oh , well thanks a fucking bunch .
i am sorry . but two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for the reader , were not you ?
not in love , exactly , but . . .
well forgive me if i do not think of you as the world s safest bet .
would you marry me if i was ?
no . probably not .
right . okay , then . shall we go ?
do not sulk . what brought all this on ?
i do not know .
very persuasive .
are you persuadable ?
no . i do not think so . i am just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days . fair enough ?
fair enough .
so ?
i am just sick of thinking about it all the time .
about what ?
this stuff . love and marriage . i want to think about something else .
i have changed my mind . that is the most romantic thing i have ever heard . i do . i will .
shut up . i am only trying to explain .
i mean , maybe you are right . but were you really expecting me to say yes ?
i dunno . did not think about it , really . it was the asking that was the important thing .
well , you have asked .
it is gonna be fine . these people are ready for anything .
hey . it is liz .
that is happening .
you called this morning ?
yeah . i just wanted to thank you for that message last night . it made me feel like . . . like less of an asshole .
how are you holding up ?
actually , i am fine . i am great . last night i got to thinking , you know what ? maybe it is time to move on . maybe we are just not right for each other . or maybe we are . but time will tell and at this point i am going to be fine with whatever s meant to be . you know ?
yeah . like i said , i do not want to take sides . and i like laura with you . she is more fun , more open . you guys are good together . i just wish you two could , i do not know . i do not think much of this ian guy
no , no , no , do not even . i talked to laura , rob . i talked to her and she gave me a little background . and you are a fucking asshole .
it is true !
rob ! two years ago you got laura pregnant you then proceeded to cheat on her ! you borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back ! and then , just a few weeks ago , you told her you were unhappy with her and were kind of looking around for somebody else !
well she
it is a crematorium .
you are kidding . a crematorium ? jesus .
what difference does it make ?
is ray going ?
no . they do not know him . and ken liked you . rob , ken did not die for your benefit , you know . it is like everybody s a supporting actor in the film of your life story .
is not that how it is for everybody ?
enough of what ?
i know i cannot speak now because laura s father died , and i just have to take it because otherwise i am a bad guy , with the emphasis on guy , self centered . well , i am fucking not , not all the time , anyway , i am really sorry jo . but you know , liz . . . i can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself . and maybe you think i should , but it is not much of a life , you know ?
maybe i have been a little unfair . but is this really the time ?
only because it is never the time . i cannot go on apologizing my whole life , you know ?
if by we you are referring to men , then i have to say that just the once would do .
good .
yup . not far from here , actually .
no , no , i love , it is just , thinking you are , you must be so sick of it . . . well .
everything go alright ?
god , i hate that time . that pick up stuff time . i just went through that before i came here . you know that song patsy cline times two i play ? that is about me and my ex dividing up our record collections .
it is a great song .
thank you .
yup .
no way ! i would cramp his style . and i would not want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall . i am way to unattached for that .
i understand completely .
yeah , but if you heard this band called the crumblers , you would
what do you mean , the crumblers ? you know the crumblers ? nobody s heard the crumblers . except me .
yeah , i know the crumblers ! i bought a used blasters album in new york about ten years ago and somebody left a crumblers single in it . my everything changed for a couple of weeks .
yeah , but you know that is his best film and nobody s even seen it ?
the conformist .
exactly ! fucking ex actly !
you have not even seen it !
nor have you !
yes . you ?
for now . but i would not be if i thought this was the end of the evening .
i am sure it is not .
good . in that case , i will fix us something else to drink . you sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee ?
whiskey .
i would better go . i gotta get up early . go over to my parents .
when i said before that i hoped it was not the end of the evening , i was , you know . . . talking about breakfast and stuff .
oh , right . alright .
jesus , so much for delicacy . i pegged you for a master of understatement , beating around the bush and all that buzz .
i use it but i do not understand it when other people use it .
so you will stay ?
yeah .
good .
god , you ask a lot of questions .
that way . you ?
that way .
and so it is . i will talk to you later .
i will call you .
right .
hi , rob . it is your mother .
everything all right ?
great . super fantastic .
how is the store ?
so so . up and down .
your lucky laura s doing so well . if it was not for her , i do not think either of us would ever sleep . . .
what do you mean ? where did she go ?
how would i know ? gone . girlfriend . leave . not say where gone . laura move out .
well call her mother .
she just called . she does not even know . it is probably the last time i will ever hear her voice . that is weird , is not it ? you spend christmas at somebody s house , you know , and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe , and . . . i dunno . . .
i am all right , if that is that is upsetting you .
you know that is not that is upsetting me .
well it fucking should be , should not it ?
i knew this would happen . what are you going to do rob ?
i am going to drink this bottle of wine watch tv and go to bed . then tomorrow i will get up and go to work .
and after that ?
meet a nice girl and have children . i promise the next time we talk i will have it all sorted out .
i knew this was going to happen .
then what are you getting so upset about ?
what did laura say ? do you know why she left ?
it is got nothing to do with marriage , if that is what you are getting at .
so you say . i would like to hear her side of it .
mom ! for the last fucking time , i am telling you laura did not want to get married ! she is not that kind of girl ! to use a phrase . that is not what happens now .
well i do not know what happens now , apart from you meet someone , you move in , she goes . you meet someone , you move in , she goes .
it is the best collection i have ever seen .
give me fifty bucks and they are all yours .
i know what they are worth . give me fifty and get them out .
but you must have
i must have nothing . their my husband s .
and you must not be getting along too well right now , huh ?
he is in jamaica with a twenty three year old . a friend of my daughter s . he had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and i told him to fuck off , so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever i go , minus a ten percent commission . which reminds me . can you make sure you give me a five ? i want to frame it and put it on the wall .
it must have taken him a long time to get them together .
years . this collection is as close as he is ever come to an achievement .
that was not part of the deal . i want to be poisonous but fair .
look . . . i . . . i am sorry . i do not want to be any part of this .
suit yourself . there are plenty of others who will .
that is why i am trying to compromise . what about fifteen hundred ? they are worth five times that .
sixty .
thirteen hundred .
seventy five .
eleven hundred . that is my lowest offer .
and i will not take a penny over ninety .
i am sorry but i think you better talk to someone else .
fine .
sure . ten cents .
oh , come on ! let me give you ten dollars for this , and you can give the rest away for all i care .
okay . because you took the trouble to come up here . and because you have got principles . but that is it . i am not selling them to you one by one .
naw . those are for us .
oh really . you two are slamming to nico now ?
well we do not .
i cannot frisk you but the cops can .
no , we . . .
records are those big round black things , right ?
fuck off .
wait a minute . island records charged u a million five against their overhead for one plane ride .
we are not there yet , justin .
i am vince .
whatever .
nice .
that is the name of your label ?
maybe he is hiding from something .
some guy named smith was asking about him in church hill . i passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank . so he is not a cop . district anyway .
dr . kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral . the father looked just like richard . even had a mark on his cheek .
how old is richard ?
p . d . says , but he barely looks .
find the father . that should clear things up .
yeah .
he would want to know about all this .
mr . congeniality ? let him find his own clues . there s a journal article in this somewhere .
uncle joey s little girl . cannot get the taste out of her mouth .
sure .
go to hell .
this one came unassembled .
fine .
did not think it was my buddy over there .
figured you knew more about swords than i did .
claymore .
huh ?
scottish claymore . take a french epee , add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business , and you have got a claymore .
you are the expert .
it is in good condition .
there was a count . count dusan . he would invite the local peasants to his chateau , fill them full of wine , then slice their bellies so he could reuse it . the symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me .
you are very macabre .
it is my birthday .
happy birthday .
thanks .
no thank you , i am fine .
why ?
well , this is a small town , and it was even smaller then . most all the babies i delivered were from local families . richard s parents were just passing through when his mother s time came . i did it right here at the house .
then you did not know richard later on .
no .
i have been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies .
do not know about any of that . suppose nobody does .
i do not follow you .
poor little tyke did not have a chance . hopelessly premature . he died a few days after he was born .
the boy died ?
mother too . sad case it was . the young lady just could not make it through labor . never even saw her son .
there was this one fella . asked a lot of questions . i was out of town but i heard he spent near a full day in the records office .
would you remember his name ?
carl smith .
so s playing choo choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of
okay okay .
you owe me . besides , i am cute .
church hill , that is pretty close , is not it ?
anything in maryland is close .
yes .
very traditional .
i would like to ask you about the claymore .
it is not mine .
it is quite rare you know , some thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years .
miss cartwright , unless you have come here to sell the sword , there s very little i can help you with . now if you will excuse me , i have a great deal of work to do .
basil the ii .
charming guy , basil . once after beating an army of serbians he blinded all but
all but one out of a hundred , i know . all left to be led like donkeys back home . now if you will please
good day , miss cartwright .
have you taken to touring small town cemetaries , miss cartwright ?
grave robbers ?
probably .
who ?
people like that rarely leave business cards .
does carl smith ?
i think you do . better yet , i do not think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place . and i think mr . smith , whoever he is , now knows that .
you have an active imagination .
i have been to church hill .
miss cartwright , you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you . i strongly suggest you return to washington and stay out of small town cemetaries .
i doubt that . good day , miss cartwright .
you will be safe here . he will not kill in a church .
why not ?
tradition .
what the hell is going on ?
where ?
dupont circle .
at the moment ? carl smith .
and you ?
you need not worry miss cartwright . i have been at this a very long time .
he called you macleod .
not your concern .
i left a man dead in felton . but you do not really care , do you ?
that bothers you ?
he was innocent .
he is dead . whatever i may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now .
what about me ?
you ?
i am a witness to a murder . that seems to put me pretty high on your friend s chop list .
have you gone to the police ?
no .
why not ? i am sure they would love to hear your story .
i would rather hear yours .
you are being foolish .
i am a historian , mr . taupin . only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face .
go home .
are you ?
no one knows you are here ?
no . i had to talk to you .
you had to do nothing !
you are wrong .
you are a fool .
maybe .
you have been listening to rumors .
our cars were seen together in felton . they are calling me an accessory to murder .
you are . now .
richard taupin has become cumbersome . it would be best if he just disappeared .
not all of them .
when you finish , what then ?
i go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad mr . taupin .
you make it all sound so simple .
the only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property i have aquired . that requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in gettysburg . but that is where you come in .
you want me to front for you .
the less exposure i recieve around government buildings the better . you , as mrs . taupin , will attract considerably less attention than i .
yes .
i wish i could .
it will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to gettysburg .
yes .
well , as long as we are stuck here .
they do it each year .
i thought it might be a nice break from all of this .
there s a catch . you are supposed to wear th century clothing .
it is beautiful .
a little dusty .
follow me .
yes .
and you are william taupin , are not you ?
yes .
no . just the child of some lonely girl i gave a ride to . when they died i put them in a grave with my name on it . twenty years later i became the son .
at least .
that is impossible .
a factor of age .
i hope i never get that old .
you will not .
why are you here ?
i have been telling myself it is the award winning journal article i am going to write . but it is not . it is you .
i see .
i am not even sure why .
hardly a reason to run off with a murderer .
my life has been chock full of people with complications and weak nesses . i cannot stand it . but you are different . it is in your hands . a clarity .
you are a very perceptive young woman .
just a little crazy .
that would be difficult to explain .
i would like you to try .
that is why smith called you macleod .
yes .
he knows about you .
he is older than i .
what could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction .
sometimes i think it is just for something to do . a conquest to be the last . something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away . some thing to replace the love that can never work .
that is insane .
perhaps . there is something more . an inheritance .
of bodies .
i did not kill the watchman .
you killed those other two .
not the same .
what about that family in ?
sometimes innocents become involved .
you and your buddy make a real team , do not you ? exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between .
there are differences .
you kill with your left hand ?
i have not killed you .
is that a threat ?
come here , brenna .
damn you .
empty . and fear . fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you . it can never last , and in the end you always end up destroying both .
but you are known so much . history i will only read about .
it is all the same . half lives that never go away .
what is it you want ?
all of it finished .
will i see you again ?
be careful . do not stay any longer than you have to .
i cannot stand it . oh god , i cannot stand it !
i am the last . oh christ , i am the last one !
no !
i will destroy you . i have destroyed everything i have ever touched ! oh god . . .
the inheritance .
not power . not control .
you have lived forever .
life is only life when it is bounded by death . the inheritance is death . the gift is the finality of life . to be part of the fabric . the inside . i love you brenna .
yes .
i am just curious .
you are never just curious . you have met my neice , brenna .
now there s a new topic .
do not they have enough for you to do at the castle ?
thanks .
call your mother . you never call her .
you better have a warrant . that is my notebook , you have got no right to be sticking your fingers into it .
i have got a morgue filling up with bodies . that is my right .
what do you want from me ?
well , the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town . and all of a sudden the smithsoniangs ambulence chaser is an expert on missing persons .
you and i should talk first .
we have got nothing to say .
four ?
all fashionably without heads .
spare me the details .
but there s more . wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in felton , delaware . some locals spotted two cars with d . c . plates and surprise surprise , they turn out to be registered to our own brenna cartwright and the ever popular richard taupin .
what are you getting at , moran ?
you have been a busy little beaver . especially with that records mess up in church hill . your notes are very complete . naturally my feelings were crushed when you did not rush right over and tell us what you knew . in fact , we are considering book ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder .
it will never stick .
but we might just give it the ole college try . what with the court back ups , it could be days before you got an arraignment . but then , i am sure the flunk out neice of the d . a . knows all about that .
you are an asshole , moran .
i want taupin .
what makes you so sure he is the one ?
just for laughs we raided wonder boy s house . there was a gallon of one of the corpse s blood in his carpet . i think it was about then i withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year .
that is all of this got to do with me ?
what were you doing in felton ?
research . if your pal was there i never saw him .
i have witnesses that can put the two of you together .
never take up poker , detective .
do not be stupid , lady . your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone else s .
all i need is for you to check the name .
you talked to your supervisor lately ? he is burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight . that on top of the cops bugging him .
i will take care of that corey , but i need this now .
it is that important ?
yeah .
some job . card filing and cabinet dusting . four years in this dump and i have not written anything for wilson that a wounded yak could not do .
i liked the bit you did about baltic chastity belts . too bad no one else did .
it is bullshit . everything . my job , the people i get involved with , i am up to here with it .
you always were hard to impress .
not who . what . worstick s a town in pennsylvania .
why ?
he is too cool . too sharp . i think he is got something to do with it .
i have seen nobleman swords that were not as well preserved . it is just a hunk of peasant iron . why would he be carrying it around in an alley ?
you see that desk ? your desk ? you see the crap piled up on it ?
give it a rest ned , huh ?
what are you doing man ?
et lux perpetua
you will not be bringing the church into this .
luceat ei
auditorium nostrum
stop .
in nomine sanctus esperitu
stop !
your name is conor ?
aye .
juan cid romirez . chief surveyor and alchemist .
you are not from these parts .
i am from spain . and i would like a moment of your time .
please go to no trouble .
five years past me clan fought another over some thing i cannot even re member .
your marks would suggest great injury .
i was nearly killed .
but you lived .
and but for a mark you are well as any man , no ?
aye .
i should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers , perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation . and a solution .
and now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew .
how can you know this ?
first food , no ? a good meal makes conversation so much easier .
pheasant .
you scots have a way with game . it still has life in it . spirit . back home the food is so . . . domestic .
why are you here ?
i was sent by his majesty of spain to inverness as a con sultant on matters of metal .
you are a long way from inverness .
in my travels i heard the story of the macleod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this earth .
you know me home . me name .
it was time for our paths to cross .
you are the same ?
do you ever feel a flow , as if some thing were pushing against you ?
yes . always .
does it change with me in the room ?
it is less .
you feel you know me .
i do not know why .
we are brothers .
some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad ition their lives have known the game . you and i conor , we are different from all others around us . you know this , you can feel it . we are flesh and bone like any man , but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure , permanently .
i do not understand .
you are still so very young .
i am twenty two .
not even a single lifetime .
what ?
we are immortal .
no !
this is madness !
it is the truth .
no !
this cannot be .
you are not dead , boy . accept it .
this is monstrous . i will burn in hell for all eternity .
you would have to die first . aqui .
you will live . survive .
then they were right . i am evil . this is god s punishment .
you have done nothing wrong conor macleod .
oh my god . oh my god i am lost .
you recall how i spoke of the push you feel and how i make it less ?
aye .
it is always less with my living . far or near . but if i were to die the push would become stronger than ever before . there is power in this . and as long as you and i live , the knight can never have it all .
but we cannot be killed .
there is an imperfection . for all your healing , if your head ever leaves your neck , you are dead . you can survive anything but steel against your threat . then it is over . the end .
how can i stop such a man ?
hide . run to the ends of the earth till you learn . you must learn to defend yourself . in this i can help .
why ?
we are brothers . and you are a defense of sorts .
me arm hurts .
again . try again .
go to hell .
oh , the boy has a mouth , now if only he had an arm .
muy bien !
it is like to kill me first .
and what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt ?
the fabric of life . the spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another .
if that was meant to be an ex planation mr . romirez from spain , i am afraid you have failed .
point conceeded , mr . macleod .
all living things pay dues , conor . they must be respected for that .
i do not think i like the sound of that .
it does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds . but the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening . for it gives you great strength . the strength of knowledge . the ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be .
i feel hardly nothing .
you have not been fully trained . but you will learn . and you will be good , i can feel that . you have apt itude . this is why our friend is so concerned .
but why be so concerned about me ?
this power is divided amongst you , me , and others like cuts in a pie . but the cuts are not equal . some , like you and he , have more . much more .
and you ?
i am a small player . but if by helping you i can keep that monster from being the last , then perhaps my life has meant something .
i am not ready for this .
you must be . you have responsibilities . you must learn the rules . you can never attract attention to yourself , never show the side that will draw others to you . you will always know when you are in the presence of another . beware . but more importantly conor macleod , will be your battle against time . in the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat . people will become a transitory , pathetic lot . the only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent . but life without morality , without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love , is no life at all . that is how the others exist . nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last . keep your soul sewed to the earth . do not become one of them .
of course .
you are young , inexperienced . you do not know what time can do . how it can sap all pity , all love .
that is not me .
with the proper tools , conor , a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one .
i will be back when i can .
i have no future husband .
i do not understand . not a week ago your father gave us his blessing .
what are you saying ? i am standing here as real as you .
you cannot be real , conor . you had the last rites . no man has been cut half as bad and lived .
but i did live .
live ? in less than a week you are prancing about the country like a squirrel .
so why the crazy talk ? it is a miracle it is . saint andrew has smiled on me . on us .
some think not .
who ?
there s rumor in the village . some call it magic .
that is mad . surely you do not take their word ?
i do not know , conor . it is not natural . maybe something has touched you .
you are sounding like that mad woman , widow baggins .
me father has taken back my hand .
i will not take that kind of talk from you . from those others below , maybe . but not from you .
leave me alone , conor . please .
you are not talking sense , mara !
do what you must .
what would you like ?
something pretty .
like you .
far away .
kiss me .
do you have cause to bothering us ?
certainly not me .
tradition .
it is all we have .
perhaps not . you seem to have misplaced a private . no doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck .
no doubt .
you surprise me . eliminating a rival like that . such are the actions of a man of conquest . i was mistaken . years have turned the boy s fear into ambit ion .
you are wrong .
i know you very well , conor macleod . and i can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you . mulet , romirez , they were fools without vision . it was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players .
romirez is dust .
finish yours ?
our common heritage . i am your only real friend , you know . the only one who truly understands you . i look forward to the day we meet again . and i kill you .
so sure ?
they are nothing but boys . it will be a slaughter tomorrow .
i doubt much can change that . the enemy has five brigades waiting for us .
we need more time .
will not get it . we are a sacrifice . a diversion .
not likely .
mulet .
staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break fast cooking .
what is your position ?
second musketeer .
i understand you joined up in bremen .
you seem to understand a great deal .
i am a major , private . you would do well remembering that when addressing me .
excuse me , sir . i thought we spoke as equals .
equals ?
if you wish to play games , major .
we have no understanding .
then it is time two of us did . you are very young . i was once young . i can help .
it can be different . it must be .
it never changes , major .
stay out of it .
do not threaten me , private .
who do you think i am ? one of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow ? threaten you ? you and i just living will always be a threat . forever . look at your life , major . look at mine . nothing there but threat . threats and nothingness . it is what we live for .
you are really going to force this , are not you ?
either you are with me or against me .
i had no choice .
have you time for some thing to eat ?
must he go ?
aye . it is his duty . all of ours .
but ian , he is still but a boy .
he is a macleod .
thanks .
where did you learn that ?
my father taught me .
your father must be smart .
yes , he was .
figure she is with him ?
yeah .
we ran down that church hill info . she is right . there is no richard taupin .
any other i . d . s come up ?
not yet . called fbi yesterday . thompsongs going to try cia this afternoon . y never know .
you would think he would had practice .
will not know till the records department comes back with it this after noon . looks good though . they found the receipt in his townhouse . it was pretty smeared but had taupings father listed as a signatory .
round up who you can and put them on standby .
think we should call the local p . d . out there first ?
no . i want this to be all ours .
i do not know .
what name is he using ?
how many came ?
the last four .
and the bulgarian ?
he got him . he always does . eventually .
he knows i am here . how ?
none of this would be happening if you had not run . . .
we learned he would found the immigration notaries in liverpool and traced them to new york . then he figured out the birth records in church hill . . .
kahn ?
are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night ?
sit .
head still secure to the neck .
how did you find me ?
how many places this side of the atlantic serve lager and lime ?
what are you doing here ?
it is the gathering , my friend . the settling of old scores .
not tonight . tonight i have a drink with an old friend .
it is good to see you , kahn .
neuvich , the clown of the crusades .
but then rides up pope pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross , climbs off his papal horse , draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on . and what did neuvich , dear dear drunken neuvich do ?
offered the pope one of his whores .
good times then . a man could stretch his legs without bring ing half the world down around his ears . not like now .
he always did .
since you last saw me .
you were never a kid .
you are insane .
no , seriously . we used to shoot pool together in rangoon .
how do you do it , kahn ? how do you live so full of life for so long ?
tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have . all else is just marking time . you are marking time .
i have had a few more concerns .
you are wrong .
you do not run as hard , macleod . you just do not run as hard anymore .
not so long .
my quarry grows clever with age . and the others , incompetent .
of sorts .
i do hope she enjoys a good show .
macleod !
leave her out of this .
as you wish .
this is not done . get up .
that is the point ! you have me , finish it !
i have waited forever for this . you will not cheapen it , little boy .
tradition .
it is all we have .
go to hell .
leave her alone .
get up .
are you here ?
i want you to come to me .
and if i refuse ?
give me an address where i can forward miss cart wright s head .
should i care ?
yes .
mr . taupin , what were you doing in that alley ?
i was walking by when i heard a shout . your men came right after .
did you know the victim ?
no .
his name was iman fasil if that jogs your memory .
it does not .
he was carrying a syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week .
american .
what are you getting at ?
let s just say that in my years with this department i have seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on th street .
that is none of your business .
you are wrong .
i presume it is a sword .
a claymore to be exact . you would not know anything about it would you ?
your murder weapon ?
it was covered with mr . fasil s fingerprints , but none of his blood .
a mystery .
for the moment .
where were you tuesday night ?
home .
a neighbor saw your car leave .
he is mistaken .
do you ?
all i need is time .
i have got all the time in the world . except right now . if you will excuse me , lieutenant .
i only just heard of conor . i came up from catroch as soon as i could .
you are a kind man to be sure .
i thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family .
steven , conor did not die .
but i had heard his wounds were mortal .
they were steven , they were . it is been a miracle it has . he lasted right through and healed . no one in the village has ever seen anything like it . ever .
the money in the estate was enough to cover your costs ?
oh yes , more than enough .
his only kid .
sure take after him . never seen a father and son look more alike .
we were very close .
the resemblance is amazing .
when may i expect the cleaners ?
i will send them right up .
same .
such a pretty day . if i live to be i will never tire of mornings like this . mind you i am now .
no .
yes sir . when you get older your priorities change . it is the simple things that count . without them growing old can be a very lonely thing .
i am sure that is true .
just your pappy scared some .
why do not you fellows get your own news ?
a double guard s been thrown around the jail , municipal buildings , railroad terminals , and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution .
ready ? the sheriff s just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the red army which is leaving moscow in a couple of minutes . up a dime .
the sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life , but he says nothing can interfere with his duty .
and to prove to the voters that the red menace is on the level , the sheriff has written himself four more letters , threatening his life . i know he wrote em on account of the misspellings .
hildy !
no , just a farewell appearance , batting for sweeney . i am going into business for myself .
what doing ?
i am getting married tomorrow .
well , congratulations ! good luck !
that is the idea of locking this ?
that is bensinger . that is his desk .
open this door !
hello , bensinger .
excuse me , i just want to
i was having a little chat about you just this afternoon with our mister duffy .
nothing ah detrimental , i hope .
i should say not ! that was one swell story you had in the paper this morning .
oh , did you care for the poem , mr . burns ?
the poem ? . . . the poem was great !
remember the ending ? and all is well , outside his cell , but in his heart he hears the hangman calling and the gallows falling and his white haired mother s tears . . .
heartbreaking ! how would you like to work for me ?
what ?
no . roy . roy v .
of course ! roy bensinger , the poet . of course you would not know ! you probably never heard of shakespeare , either ! put mr . bensinger right on the staff . how much are you getting on the tribune , roy ?
seventy five .
i will give you a hundred and a by line .
sort of a jack london style ?
exactly !
it does not have to rhyme !
au revoir , mon capitaine .
bon jour !
even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you .
do not be embarrassed , bruce . i heard it , but i just wanted to hear it again . i can stand being spoiled a little . the gentleman i am going to have a chat with did very little spoiling .
i would like to spoil him just once . sure you do not want me to go in with you ?
my job , bruce . i started it and i will finish it .
i suppose you are right but if it gets rough , remember i am here .
i will come a running , pardner .
it will be perfectly all right , walter . mother is coming with us on the train .
you are so nice , bruce , you think everybody else is .
oh , he is not the man for you . i can see that . but i sort of like him . got a lot of charm .
he comes by it naturally . his grandfather was a snake .
if anybody had told me i would be sitting at lunch with him but he swept me right off my feet .
that is what he did to me . swept me right off my feet and left me lying on the floor .
no . it is strong . but i like it that way .
he certainly hic does !
wait a minute , bruce . that is commission on a , . policy ?
well , at his age , twenty payment life , a little over a thousand dollars .
and that is the matter with a thousand dollars ?
but
according to the budget , we laid out that is more than our food bill for a whole year . listen , bruce , i do not want walter burns to use me , but i am perfectly willing to use him . how long will it take to get him examined ?
i could get a company doctor in twenty minutes .
better make that a certified check , walter .
wait a minute , bruce . have you got that money ?
the five hundred ? sure .
on second thought , would you let me have it ? i will get the tickets .
but
believe me , bruce , i know what i am doing . he would get you in a crap game
but i do not gamble , hilda !
i know a lot of men who did not do anything till they met walter burns . please , dear .
all right . one two three four five . five hundred . be careful , honey .
i will be careful , darling . you be , please .
certified and everything . got it right here in my wallet . . . what ? no , he is not here i am in a phone booth .
fine . and here s a kiss for you .
i lost my wallet .
the check , bruce !
yes , was not it ?
i cannot imagine who did it . i cannot think of any enemies i have .
i am sure you have not any .
for a minute , i thought maybe walter burns was at the back of it . but then i realized he could not have been .
oh , no . how could you ever think of such a thing ?
oh , i realized right away . he is really a very nice fellow , hildy i found that out .
yes , he is . . . look , bruce , we are taking that next train and when i say next train , this time i mean it !
did you finish the interview ?
the criminal courts building .
but , gee , hildy he gave us that insurance business and you promised
well , the story s practically finished . i will just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger .
hello , bruce . . .
not through any help of yours , hildy .
bruce , i know , but i was in the biggest jam
we will explain the whole thing to them .
i know i got you into this , hildy , but it does seem to me that you cannot care much for me if you are willing to let me stay locked up for two hours .
bruce , you know i am mad about you and stop talking like that . walter !
where would she go ?
out some place .
oh mother she i do not know where she went .
did you give her the money ?
no , i was going to give it to her but she left hurriedly .
then suppose you give me the money . four hundred and fifty dollars .
oh , yes . here it is .
thank you .
you got it back , eh ? there s something funny going on around here .
fine .
i have just told you i was busy with mr . bruce baldwin !
i am bruce baldwin !
yes !
then who are you ?

oh , i thought there was something funny . . . you see , bruce , you do not mind if i call you bruce , do you ? after all , we are practically related
mr . well no no not at all .
you see , my wife i mean , your wife that is , i mean hildy had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man .
oh .
but i see , she did not mean old in years . you always carry an umbrella , bruce ?
well , er it looked a little cloudy this morning .
that is right . rubbers , too , i hope ? a man ought to be prepared for any emergency .
where are we going ?
where are we going ? i am going to buy you two lunch did not hildy tell you ?
no she did not .
just wanted to surprise you , i guess . down ! after you , bruce ! come on , hildy , my treat !
feels awful good . yes , sir we are taking the four o clock train to albany and tomorrow we will be married .
taking the train today and being married tomorrow ?
no . my mother .
oh . your mother well , of course , that relieves my mind .
i do not think she will need you very much i aim to do most of the protecting myself .
i know you will , bruce . are you going to live with your mother ?
just for the first year .
that will be nice . a home with mother . a real honeymoon . in albany , too . ow !
yes , i know . . . hildy , will you ever forget the night you brought the governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath ? she did not even know i was in town . . .
well , albany s a mighty good insurance town . most people there take it out pretty early in life .
i do not blame them .
well , i honestly feel that way . i figure i am in one line of business that really helps people . of course , we do not help you much when you are alive but afterward that is what counts .
i see what you mean .
just sweeney again . one of my best reporters .
it is simple . a poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down .
all you have got to do is talk to him . but the mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re elected .
but could not you show the man was not responsible ?
how ?
oh an hour for the interview . another hour to write it .
we could take the six o clock train , hildy . if it would save a mangs life .
you have not seen anything yet .
why should not i make hildy my beneficiary ? i have got nobody else to leave it to .
i feel i ought to take care of her .
well , you will take care of her . after all , if that doctor s right , i am going to live for a long time yet . look , bruce , this is a debt of honor . i was a very bad husband hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she would wanted to , but she would not take any . she had it coming to her , but she was too independent .
well , i am independent , too .
figure it this way i ought to be good for twenty five years . by that time , you will probably have made enough so that the money will not mean anything . but suppose you have not made good do not you think hildy s entitled to a quiet old age without any worries ?
well , of course , if you put it that way .
and remember this , bruce ! i love her , too .
i am beginning to realize that .
and the beauty of it is she will never have to know till i have passed on . maybe she will think kindly of me after i am gone .
gee , you almost make me feel like a heel coming between you .
no , bruce , you did not come between us . it was all over for her before you came on the scene . for me it will never be over .
certified ! i am afraid hildy would feel ashamed to think she had not trusted you .
that is all i ask . oh , wait a minute .
thanks . i will phone hildy right away to get that story .
thanks a lot .
oh , sure . well , thanks for everything .
do not thank me . i should thank you . so long .
so long .
what the devil do you want ? listen , bruce , you cannot come in here now ! we are busy ! where you been , duffy ? stick around ! what ? what chinese earthquake ? the deuce with it . . . that is that ?
oh . i wonder that is keeping mother ? she was supposed to come down and get you .
come on , hildy , we have got to keep going ! sorry , bruce , but
if she is not there , mother and i are leaving anyhow !
suppose she is i have feelings , too ! do you know where i have been for the last couple of hours ? locked up in a police station and she did not move to do anything about it .
ts ! ts ! ts !
and now i do not know where my mother is . she may be lost .
i will find her , bruce , if i have to put every detective in the city on the job . tell you what go over to the missing persons bureau and describe your mother . what does she look like ?
she is well , she is very motherly . that is about the best description i know .
that is the kind of stuff they want !
the money ? why ?
there s a lot of counterfeit big bills going around .
gee ! take a look , will you ?
say , i want to be sure , too !
you cannot bluff me , burns . i do not care who you are or what paper you are editor of .
you will ask me to what ?
get out !
close that door . do not let anybody in or out .
oh , you did ! well , that is very , very interesting . this happens to be the gun that earl williams shot his way out with !
i will give you three minutes to tell me where he is .
who s under arrest ? you pimple headed , square toed spy do you realize what you are doing ?
i will show you what i am doing . burns , you are guilty of obstructing justice and so is the morning post . i am going to see that the post is fined ten thousand dollars for this .
you will see nothing of the kind , sheriff .
we will just start by impounding the post property . is that your desk ?
you will , eh ? well , we will see about that . all right , boys . take it .
i am warning you it will be a federal offense . and you will be an accessory !
we will take a chance on that , burns . go ahead , boys .
oh , trying to frame me , eh ! i never saw this woman before in my life !
no , you do not !
do you want to get us scooped ?
give me the district attorney s office . i will tell you what you will be doing making brooms in the state penitentiary . hello , d arrasty ! this is hartwell . come over to my office , will you ? i have just arrested a couple of important birds and i want to take their confessions .
get out of here , you !
your luck s not with you now !
all the lawyers in the world are not going to help you !
this is the morning post you are talking to !
the power of the press , huh !
out of the mouths of babes .
he is insane or drunk or something . why , if this unfortunate man , williams , has really been reprieved , i personally am tickled to death . are not you , pete ?
what did you say your name was pinkus ?
why , i am surprised , mr . burns . that is no way to talk to your wife even if she is no longer your wife .
hello , hildy !
hello , walter . hi , louie how is the slotmachine king ?
you know what . how long since we have seen each other ?
let s see . i was in reno six weeks then bermuda . . . oh , about four months , i guess . seems like yesterday to me .
maybe it was yesterday . been seeing me in your dreams ?
no mama does not dream about you any more , walter . you would not know the old girl now .
oh , yes i would . i would know you any time
i notice you still remember it .
i will always remember it . if i had not remembered it , i would not have divorced you .
you know , hildy , i sort of wish you had not done it .
done what ?
divorced me . it sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself . it almost gives him a feeling he was not wanted .
holy mackerel ! look , walter , that is what divorces are for .
nonsense . you have got the old fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever till wouldeath us do part . why , a divorce does not mean anything today . it is only a few words mumbled over you by a judge . we have got something between us nothing can change .
i suppose that is true in a way . i am fond of you , walter . i often wish you were not such a stinker .
now , that is a nice thing to say .
well , why did you promise me you would not fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works ?
well , i meant to let you go but , you know , you never miss the water till the well runs dry .
a fellow your age , hiring an airplane to write hildy do not be hasty remember my dimple . walter . ! it held things up twenty minutes while the judge ran out to watch it .
well , i do not want to brag , but i have still got the dimple and in the same place i just acted like any husband who does not want to see his home broken up .
what home ?
all i know is that instead of two weeks in atlantic city with my bridegroom , i spent two weeks in a coal mine with john kruptzky age sixty three getting food and air out of a tube ! you do not deny that . do you ?
deny it ! i am proud of it ! we beat the whole country on that story .
well , suppose we did ? that is not what i got married for . that is the good of look , walter , i came up here to tell you that you will have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day sending twenty telegrams all the rest of it , because i am
let s not fight , hildy . tell you what . you come back to work on the paper and if we find we cannot get along in a friendly way , we will get married again .
what ? ! !
i have not any hard feelings .
walter , you are wonderful in a loathesome sort of way . now , would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what i came up here for ?
sure , come on . we will have some lunch and you can tell me everything .
i have a lunch date . i just want
you can break it , cannot you ?
no , i cannot .
sure you can . come on .
do not tell me what to do ! we are divorced i am a free woman . you are not my husband and you are not my boss ! and that is more , you are not going to be my boss .
what do you mean by that ?
just what i said . that is what i
you mean you are not coming back to work here ?
that is the first time you have been right today . that is what i
you have had a better offer , eh ?
you bet i have got a better offer .
well , go on and take it . work for somebody else ! that is the gratitude i get for
i know , walter , but i
what were you when you came here five years ago ? a little college girl from a school of journalism ! i took a little doll faced mugg
you would not have taken me if i had not been doll faced !
why should i ? i thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering .
listen , walter
i made a great reporter out of you , hildy , but you will not be half as good on any other paper , and you know it . you need me and i need you and the paper needs both of us .
well , the paper will have to learn to do without me . and so will you . it just did not work out , walter .
it would have worked if you would been satisfied with just being editor and reporter . but no ! you had to marry me and spoil everything .
i was not satisfied ! i suppose i proposed to you !
well , you practically did ! making goo goo eyes at me for two years till i broke down . and i still claim i was tight the night i proposed . if you would been a gentleman you would have forgotten all about it . but not you !
you you
that is the matter ?
sweeney .
dead ?
not yet . might just as well be . the only man on the paper who can write and his wife picks this morning to have a baby !
sweeney ? well , after all , he did not do it on purpose , did he ?
i do not care whether he did or not . he is supposed to be covering the earl williams case and there he is waiting at the hospital ! is there no sense of honor left in this country ?
well , have not you got anybody else ?
there s nobody else on the paper who can write ! this will break me , unless hildy !
no !
you have got to help me , hildy .
keep away
it will bring us together again , hildy just the way we used to be .
that is what i am afraid of . any time any place anywhere !
do not mock , hildy , this is bigger than anything that is happened to us . do not do it for me ! do it for the paper .
get away , svengali .
if you will not do it for love , how about money ? forget the other offer and i will raise you twenty five bucks a week .
listen , you bumble headed baboon
all right thirty five , and not a cent more !
please ! will you just
great grief ! that is that other paper going to give you ?
i am not working for any other paper !
oh ! in that case , the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it . trying to blackjack
look at this !
get married all you want to , hildy , but you cannot quit the newspaper business .
you cannot sell me that , walter .
who says i cannot ? you are a newspaper man .
that is why i am quitting . i want to go some place where i can be a woman .
i know you , hildy , and i know what it would mean . it would kill you .
a journalist ! peeking through keyholes running after fire engines waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think hitler s going to start a war stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen ! i know all about reporters a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets , and for what ? so a million hired girls and motormengs wives will know that is going on ! no , walter , i am through .
where would you meet this man ?
bermuda .
bermuda . . . rich , eh ?
not what you would call rich . makes about five thousand a year .
that is his line ?
he is in the insurance business .
the insurance business ?
it is a good , honest business , is not it ?
oh sure , it is honest . but somehow , i cannot picture you with a guy who sells policies .
well , i can , and i love it ! he forgets the office when he is with me . he does not treat me like an errand boy he treats me like a woman .
he does , does he ? how did i treat you like a water buffalo ?
i do not know about water buffaloes , but i know about him . he is kind and sweet and considerate . he wants a home and children .
say , sounds more like a guy i ought to marry . that is his name ?
well , i will give you a hint . by tomorrow they will be calling me mrs . bruce baldwin .
tomorrow ? tomorrow . . . as quick as that ?
the quicker the better . well i finally got out what i came in to tell you . so long , walter , and better luck next time .
i wish you everything i could not give you , hildy .
thanks . . .
too bad i could not see this guy first . i am pretty particular about whom my wife marries .
well , he is waiting in the anteroom for me now .
say , could i meet him ?
oh , better not , walter . would not do any good .
you are not afraid , are you ?
afraid ? i should say not !
all right then , come on and let s see this paragon . is he as good as you say ?
better .
now you got me .
nothing personal . i was just asking .
no kidding ?
what for ?
and when he walks with a lady , he waits for her !
oh , i am sorry .
thanks .
how do you like that ? here i am being nice to you and your sweet heart and that is the thanks i get !
i might have , walter , but you were never there .
anyway , i am glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things i could not give her . you know , hildy is about the best reporter in the country and that goes regardless of sex . but all she really ever wanted was a home .
thank you .
his wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord . they cannot even find him . i tell you , drink is the ruin of this nation .
you said it .
so sweeney gets twins and earl williams gets hanged tomorrow .
because it happened to be a colored policeman .
the colored vote happens to be very important to the mayor of this town .
especially with an election coming up in a few days .
i am an editor . i know what ought to be written , but i cannot write it the way you could . it needs a womangs heart
why , walter , you are getting poetic !
you see what i had to put up with ? she never trusted me ! you argue with her otherwise you are going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands !
what a performance ! bravo ! do not let him fool you , bruce it is only an act !
what do you mean , only an act ? have not you got any feeling ?
well , it is either an act on your part or a miracle on sweeney s .
what do you mean ?
i happen to know sweeney was married only three months ago . if he is got twins this morning , i claim it was done with mirrors .
all right , hildy , i am licked . but i will make you and bruce a business proposition .
we are not interested .
maybe you will be . you are a smart young man . you let hildy do this story for me and you can write out a , . insurance policy for me . what do you say ?
you keep out of this . bruce , suppose you examine mr . burns in his office . i will get my bag and go over to the press room in the criminal courts building . you phone me as soon as mr . burns has given you his check . then i will go get the interview and you phone mother that we are taking the six o clock train . and no tricks , walter !
what tricks would i pull ?
oh , nothing ! of course , you might cancel the check . yes ! wait a minute ! what would be his first payment on that policy ?
yes and that is putting it mildly ! no certified check no story get me ?
all right . the check will be certified . want my fingerprints ?
no thanks , i have still got those . well , i will step into some working clothes and hop over to the press room for the background on this yarn . it will be kind of fun to see the boys again , too . remember , bruce , it must be certified .
it cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of cooley .
never mind that . that is the story ?
never mind it ? that is not my money ! that is bruce s money !
you will get it . now that is the story ? i will have the paper send the money right down to you . i swear it on my mother s grave .
wait a minute . your mother s alive .
i meant on my grandmother s grave . do not be so technical , hildy . that is the story ? !
well , this expert dr . egelhoffer , from new york , decides to make williams re enact the crime
no kidding , hildy . say , this is not a rib ?
no , this is on the level , walter . i am not good enough to make this one up . the sheriff gave his gun to the professor , the professor gave it to earl , and earl gave it right back to the professor right in the stomach ! who ? no , egelhoffer was not hurt badly . they took him to the county hospital where they are afraid he will recover .
that is great work , hildy . . . huh ? oh , will you stop worrying about the money ? i will see you get it in fifteen minutes .
it better be fifteen minutes , because bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter s clicking away to beat the band .
hold on a minute .
yes . where is he ?
she jumped out of the window .
i know . where is he , i said .
let go o me ! i have got to get bruce out of jail ! oh , walter , why did you have to do this to me ?
get bruce out of jail ! how can you worry about a man who s resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on ? hildy , this is war ! you cannot desert now !
oh , get off that trapeze ! there s your story ! smear it all over the front page earl williams caught by the morning post ! and take all the credit i covered your story for you and i got myself in a fine mess doing it and now i am getting out ! i know i told you that twice before today but this time i mean it !
you drooling idiot ! what do you mean , you are getting out ! there are three hundred and sixty five days in the year one can get married but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk ? once in a lifetime ! hildy , you have got the whole city by the seat of the pants !
i know , but
you know ! you have got the brain of a pancake ! that was not just a story you covered it was a revolution ! hildy ! this is the greatest yarn in journalism since livingstone discovered stanley for the new york herald !
wait a minute was not it stanley who discovered livingstone ?
do not get technical at a time like this ! do you realize what you have done ? you have taken a city that is been graft ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you are kicking em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that new york s having under la guardia ! we will make such monkeys out of these ward heelers next tuesday that nobody will vote for them not even their wives !
i would like to think .
well , think it then , because it is true ! we will crucify that mob . we are going to keep williams under cover till morning so the post can break the story exclusive . then we will let the governor in on the capture share the glory with him .
i get it !
you have kicked over the whole city hall like an apple cart . you have got the mayor and hartman backed against a wall . you have put one administration out and another in . this is not a newspaper story it is a career ! and you stand there belly aching about whether you catch an eight o clock train or a nine o clock train ! still a doll faced mugg ! that is all you are .
let me get at that typewriter and i will show you how a doll faced mugg can write !
attagirl ! why , they will be naming streets after you hildy johnson street ! there will be statues of you in the parks , hildy . the radio will be after you the movies ! by tomorrow morning i will betcha there s a hildy johnson cigar ! i can see the billboards now . light up with hildy johnson !
whoa wait a minute . we cannot leave williams here . one of the other fellows will
we are going to take him over to my private office . where is our phone ?
that one how you gonna take him ? they will see him .
you cannot take that desk out . it is crawling with cops outside .
we will lower it out of the window with pulleys . quit stalling .
huh !
get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load , will you ? snap into it !
how much do you want on it ?
all the words you have got .
where is some paper ?
call him a love child , if you want to . duffy !
give him the works . hello , duffy , get set ! we have got the biggest story in the world . earl williams caught by the morning post exclusive !
okay , walter .
all right , walter .

oh , i see . i beg your pardon .
when i am surrounded , with my back against the wall , you are not going to lay down on me , are you
yes .
i do not care what you say . i am going to find bruce s mother . oh h . . . i am going out and find her !
who says so ? i am going to the morgue to look
what is it ? here !
yes ! what are you afraid of hildy ? i dare him to move that desk out of here .
murder , uh ?
hanging an innocent man to win an election !
who did you talk to ?
just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment .
and your arrest . you will each get about ten years , i think .
do not tell me you were worried !
worried ! i was petrified . were not you ?
uh uh . as long as we were in there together pitching they could not lick us . well , it is been a lot of fun .
in a way .
i mean working together . just like the old days . the things we have been through , hildy .
we have certainly been in some swell jams .
remember the time we broke into the d . a . s office , and copied fifi randell s diary ?
yeah . what about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory ? six scoop interviews !
yeah but that time we stole old lady haggerty s stomach off the coroner s physician . we proved she was poisoned though , did not we ?
we sure did , but we had to go in hiding for a week .
in the shoreland hotel . and our only chaperon was the poor old lady s stomach .
do not remind me . that is how we happened to
that is all right , walter . it is as much my fault as yours .
bruce is making the nine o clock train . i told him you would be on it unless you want to write this story yourself .
well , if it is my last story , i would like it to be a good one . but i guess i cannot , walter .
suit yourself , kid . this is not for me to decide . of course , you could make a later train and still be in albany tomorrow morning .
yeah . i suppose i could . but , walter
he is going to have you the rest of his life , hildy . cannot you give me another hour ?
i do not know what to do , walter .
flip a coin .
all right . heads i go tails i stay to write the story . ready ?
that is the difference ? i am going to write that story and you know it !
do not touch me ! i am not doing it for you !
then why are you doing it ?
because i am a newspaper woman , heaven help me !
thanks .
and what a way to quit . while you are still champion ! that is the way to leave , hildy !
yeah . only only i am not leaving , walter .
what do you mean ? bruce will be waiting for you in albany .
no , he will not . i wired him that i was not coming .
where would you wire him ?
on the nine o clock train . that is the one he took , is not it ?
sure .
it is awfully clear now . bruce needs a wife who can give him a home and affection and peace . i could not do that for him , walter . i am what you made me a cheap reporter who would give up her soul for a story ! . . . is that job still open ?
both jobs are open , hildy . the paper and being mrs . walter burns .
thanks , walter , but it is no good . we tried it .
sure , it was good it was wonderful ! only you expected it to be like other marriages . it cannot be like other marriages we are different ! we are a different world . look at what we went through today . i would not trade that for any honeymoon in the world . i bet you would not , either .
a fine honeymoon , with a murderer right in the boudoir ! and that other honeymoon in a coal mine !
that is what makes it romantic . every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is , and vice versa . but us you never know where i am and i am not sure where you are . that is romance !
well , maybe i would like to know just once !
hildy , if that is what you want , all right . we will even go to how about niagara falls ?
niagara falls ! walter , you do not mean that ?
sure i do . and i will tell you something else i would like a baby .
walter !
sure , i cannot last forever . i want a son i can train to take my place on this paper .
what would you do if it was a daughter ?
well , if she looked like you say ! my brains and your looks that might not be such a bad combination .
that is the matter with my brains ?
that is the good of arguing about something that probably does not exist ? look , hildy , i am proposing to you . what do you say ?
well , i would like to be lady like and think it over .
i do not want to rush you . take a couple of seconds .
now do not argue , hildy . how about it , judge ?
hildy , from this time on no tricks , no double crossing everything on the level !
you are not fooling anybody .
walter , you cannot do that !
sure , i can . look at the policy i gave him ! with this ring i thee wed and with all my worldly goods i thee endow and thereto i plight thee my troth .
yes hildy , darling . i am just a fool . that is what i am . i know what it is going to be like .
it will be heaven !
sure , heaven ! you have probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in to get a new story for your paper !
you you ! !
that is that that is that ?
you know you did !
i was in here and they had some kind of murderer in with them . they were hiding him !
you grey haired old judas !
let me out ! let me out of here !
take that mush out of your mouth !
what do you mean , i handed her ? the patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street .
now everything s fine . she is probably squawking her head off in some police station .
i do not think she is talking much . . . you know what i mean ?
western ang thirty fourth .
beat it out and get hold of some guys .
who do you want ?
anybody with hair on his chest . get em off the street anywhere . offer them anything only get them . we have got to get this desk out of here .
you got plenty of money ?
sure , boss .
i mean real money not counterfeit !
i always have both .
i am busy , duffy .
well , you are not too busy to know that the governor has not signed that reprieve !
what ?
and that means earl williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us !
you are crazy . where is mac ?
he is on my phone . he just called me .
they cannot do that to me !
yeah ! well , i do the firing , too . remember that , duffy , and keep a civil tongue in your head .
do not worry , duffy , you will have it back by five . thanks , duffy . stick around .
i want to interview earl williams , warden . how about a little service ?
no more interviews . besides , a doctor s coming over .
i think it is .
i thought so . come on , i am in a hurry .
hildy i cannot . i am busy i let me up , hildy . earl williams has escaped
i cannot hildy . it means my job ! it means
a lot of money . four hundred and fifty dollars
four hundred and fifty dollars . is it a deal ?
it is a deal . let me up .
first we talk . how did earl williams get that gun ?
you said it !
they are always after me for interviews .
me , too .
of course , i sort of promised them i would give out a statement when i got through here . you do not mind ?
well , i do not know if that is ethical . you see , all statements are supposed to come from me .
we will have to satisfy them . what would you say to giving them a joint interview ? i could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects .
a joint interview , eh ? that might be all right . we could have our pictures taken together , doctor .
yes , shaking hands . i do not take a very good picture , though .
it does not matter . the publicity s the main thing .
yes , i suppose so . it all helps .
come , come , sheriff , lightning does not strike in the same place twice . nothing s going to happen .
oh , i am sorry . i forgot you were here . no , mr . williams , we still have some questions for you . sheriff , will you kindly extinguish the lights ?
the system . but i am not afraid to die , doctor . i am dying for what i believe .
i see . you realize , however , that you committed a crime ?
in a legal sense , yes . but not actually . actually , i am innocent . i did not do anything .
yes , sir .
well , it was not exactly that way
point the gun at me !
good . now i want to ask you fellows a couple of questions . did earl williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun ?
i know , i just want to give him a thrill .
three bullets ! any good ?
beats king up .
just a second , mike mollie , i got it !
all right all right !
mollie , drop down here ! you have fainted !
run down and get some smelling salts , will you ?
came up here had hysterics and passed out . i have been trying to get her to come to .
give me a hand with her , will you ?
okay . up you go , mollie .
it is easy for you to talk . you are retired . we are still working .
aw , why do not you let her alone ? she is ill !
this egelhoffer s pretty good .
yeah ? what did he ever do for his country ?
do not you remember ? he is the guy went to washington to interview the brain trust , and gave out a statement that they were all sane . it created a sensation !
what have you got , hildy ?
who s this guy she is gonna marry ?
well , if she is gonna write fiction , there s nothing like being a reporter .
that is the use ? i cannot win a pot .
lioness rushes to defense of cub .
the crime commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for williams capture .
call you back .
that is the dope , sheriff ?
who engineered this getaway ?
something smells around here . if you ask me mollie gave her the story on how williams got that gun . did you smuggle that gun into williams , mollie ?
i tell you , it is a screwy set up . we better hold onto em both .
do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots ?
where is he , before we beat it out of you ?
make them talk and you got williams , pinky !
i will have it in a minute .
three sixes . is that any good ?
so long , hildy .
no luck on williams , yet call you back .
now , where is he ?
probably going out to get williams .
i cannot complain .
little rum in yours , too ?
i guess so .
just coffee . and you , sir ?
that is all right .
good coffee , is not it ?
i gave strict orders that nobody was to interview williams without my permission .
all right , then , i will just run the story that sheriff hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner . of course , with election coming , that might do you a lot of harm , but just as you say .
now , wait a minute ! i am not afraid of anything . what were you going to write about williams ?
oh , nothing much . just that the state had proved he was sane and he admits it himself . if you do not want me to run it
oh , that will be all right , hildy . go ahead , run it . and you can say i treated him well , too . lo , earl . how are you feeling ?
you ought to stay over . you always wrote a good hanging story , hildy .
that is awful kind of you , sheriff . i have got to get started on my interview . see you later .
let go o me . that is the idea ?
hold her , boys !
hang onto her ! keep her in here !
johnson , there s something very peculiar going on .
you can send somebody with me if you do not believe me !
i was not born yesterday . now the boys tell me you and this mollie malloy
nobody s trying to put anything over on you . i am getting out of here and you cannot stop me !
what do i know about williams ?
all right , boys . take her along . i got ways of making her talk .
i have got a right to carry a gun if i want to .
not this gun !
what ?
with a bag of marshmallows .
do not take any chances . shoot through the desk .
he cannot hurt anybody . you have got his gun .
all right ! carl ! frank ! one of you get on each side of the desk . take hold of the cover .
this tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of sheriff hartmangs bombing squad .
what went off ?
four of mr . hartmangs deputy sheriffs were rushed to the hospital
a fine fair weather friend you are !
the names are merwyn d . mayor , who is the mayor s brother in law
after all i have done for you
howard shenken , the sheriff s uncle on his mother s side
where he used to live . you can catch the riot squad it is just going out .
you are certainly a hard fellow to find , sheriff .
earl williams . the reprieve .
yeah . but i
no , i could not do that .
that is good , because my health ai not what it used to be .
i ai not got time , fred , honest . i will see you after .
did you actually give williams that gun ?
the professor asked me for it i thought it was for something scientific !
pete , i have got a mighty unpleasant task to perf
four hundred ! do you want to bankrupt this administration ?
i am getting them for twelve dollars a night .
twelve dollars ! for those rheumatic uncles of yours ? out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it ?
if you are talking about my brother in law , he is worked for the city fifteen years .
what do you mean through ?
i mean i am scratching your name off the ticket tuesday and running czernecki in your place . it is nothing personal . and , pete it is the only way out . it is a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make .
fred !
now , pete ! please do not appeal to my sentimental side .
fred , i do not know what to say . a thing like this almost destroys a mangs faith in human nature .
i wish you would not talk like that , pete .
our families , fred . i have always looked on bessie as my own sister .
if there was any way out . . .
we are up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented areform the reds with a rope .
well , there s a lot of communistic sympathizers around
i know it ! but they have got nothing to do with this case ! do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang earl williams we are going to lose em ?
but we are going to hang him , fred . he cannot get away .
and you fell for it , pete . it frightens me what i would like to do to you . who else knows about this ?
an attempt to ruin us !
we got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this . what will we tell em ?
tell em the party is through in this state on account of you .
ah , fred hello . . . this is hartman
and you can tell em as an afterthought that i want your resignation now !
sssh . wait , fred . what ? . . . where ? . . . where ? holy moses !
what is it ?
they got him ! wait a minute hold the wire . they got earl williams surrounded the riot squad has in his house .
tell em to hold the wire .
i did . hold the wire .
cover up that transmitter !
how would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month . that is almost a hundred dollars a week !
now what do you say ?
just one second !
what ?
shoot to kill , i said .
i do not know , fred . there s that reprieve if they ever find out .
nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered . now , do as i tell you .
hello , olsen . . . listen . . . shoot to kill . . . that is the orders pass the word along . . . no ! we dont want him ! and listen , olsen , five hundred bucks for the guy that does the job . . . yes , i will be right out there . well , i hope that is the right thing to do .
now take that guilty look off your face , pete and stop trembling like a horse .
if we did not have election tuesday i would have this on my conscience .
look kind o natural , do not they , fred ?
a sight for sore eyes !
aiding an escaped criminal ! and a little charge of kidnapping i am looking into . but that is the jail ! there must be somebody there !
well ! looks like about ten years apiece for you birds !
throw him out , frank .
it is a frame up ! some imposter !
i never saw him before !
i was just going to !
i was only doing my duty . nothing personal in it .
so do you what , you hoodoo ! and now , mr . pinkus , if you will come with us , we will take you over to the wardengs office and deliver this reprieve .
that is good , earl . oh , they have got another alienist to see you . he ought to be here any minute . do not go to sleep , will you ?
i will not .
hildy , how would you like a couple of tickets for the hanging ?
yeah , you do not want to tire him out , doctor .
go on shoot me !
but , hildy , i cannot . he is accused of stealing a watch . and they found the watch on him .
and who accused him ? diamond louis ! one of the worst crooks in town ! why do not you arrest louis instead of innocent people that he frames ?
now , hildy
do not hildy me ! are you going to let him out ?
i cannot .
all right . you cannot . but tomorrow the post will run the story of that roulette game on rd street that your brother in law runs . and we will print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it !
now , hildy , do not be hasty ! i cannot let him out .
you can let him out on bail , cannot you ?
five hundred dollars .
you will take fifty and like it !
well , all right . but i am liable to get into a jam .
editorials ?
my name is louis peluso .
i am telling you !
oh h h . . . was she hurt ?
what did you do with her ?
search me ! when i come to i was running down thirty fifth street .
you were with her . you were in the cab , were not you ?
was i ? the driver got knocked cold .
all right , judge .
phone for you , hildy .
who is it ?
oh , some insurance man . are you in ?
give me that !
i will go right after it .
that is the matter ? getting yellow ?
well , hildy , we were only saying that a swell reporter like you would not give this up so easily .
this is hildy johnson . . . oh , i can give it up all right . without a single quiver . i am going to live like a human being not like you rats . oh , is that you , walter dear ? oh , i did not mean dear . that was just habit , i guess . oh , be yourself , walter . i have got some news for you . . . yes , i got the interview , but i have got some news that is more important .
i will take it . that is the matter , mr . burns do not you understand english ? why , your language is shocking , mr . burns positively shocking ! i do not mind because i was married to you and know what to expect , but suppose central is listening in . . . oh , did you hear that , central ? we ought to report him , do not you think ? . . . oh , fooey on you !
yeah . i was never so tired in my life .
and up a dime .
your poker s improved a lot , hildy . lend me two bucks , will you ?
nothing doing . i am playing for keeps .
but , bruce , do not keep it in your wallet ! . . . well , you see there s an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you you put in the lining of your hat . that brings you good luck for ten years .
say , i have been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that . where would you get it ?
i made it up just now , and who s asking you ? i know it is silly , honey , but do it for me , will not you ? . . . yes , right now .
i thought so , too .
no what ?
okay , hildy . well , we cannot get any official statement
that is the matter with you boys ? afraid it might rain ? if you want to go , i will cover this end .
that is the use of fighting , hildy ?
oh , sure . the boss sent me over with it . four hundred dollars , was not it ?
four hundred and fifty and i will cut your throat if you try any tricks !
all right , all right . you cannot blame a guy for trying , can you ?
come on with that money !
first you got to sign a receipt .
where is the money ?
keep your shirt on . i got it right here . one hundred two hundred three hundred four hundred and fifty . now sign .
here !
thanks . so long , hildy !
so long , nothing ! where is bruce baldwings wallet ?
huh ?
none of that innocent stuff , you double crossing hyena ! you stuck bruce baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch , and you frisked his wallet ! now , give me that wallet or i will stick you in jail and it will not be on any phony charge either ! it will be for life !
now do not get excited , hildy ! i do not know what you are talking about but is this mr . baldwings wallet ?
i did not frisk him . he must have dropped it in burns office . i did not know whose it was .
no and you do not know that your cheap boss has had mr . baldwin arrested again do you ?
what already ? why , the dame left only a minute before i did !
that is good .
kings and sixes the pot affixes . . . poetry . i learned that at my grandma s knee .
from all i can get the sheriff let him out so s he could vote for him .
well i was going , but mollie fainted away and i thought i ought to do what i could .
some hallowe en going on outside . the whole police force standing on it is ear .
mother !
do not you mother me ! playing cat and mouse with my poor boy ! keeping him looked up making us miss two trains and supposed to be married tomorrow !
mother , i can explain everything . i will go with you in five minutes and
you do not have to go with me at all ! just give me my songs money and you can stay here forever as far as i am concerned . stay with that murderer you caught !
i am quoting my son , and he has never lied to me .
that man there !
mother ! oh , i am so glad to see you ! are you all right ? tell me .
you did not mean to kill that policeman ?
of course not . i could not kill anybody it is against everything i have ever stood for . they know it was an accident . they are not hanging me for that they are hanging me for my beliefs .
what are your beliefs , earl ?
they are very simple . i believe in the golden rule . i am not the first man to die for preaching it . but if they would only listen to it we could have a fine , decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things .
how would you go about applying the golden rule , earl ?
i would do away with the profit system and have production for use only . there s enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we would use some sense .
production for use only . well , maybe that is the answer .
it is the only answer . everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose , we could solve all our problems . food was meant to be eaten , not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved clothing was meant to be worn , not piled up in stores while people went naked . does not that make sense ?
yes , that makes a lot of sense , earl .
is that how you came to shoot the policeman ?
sure . you see , i would never had a gun in my hand before and i did not know what to do with it . well , when i get stuck , i know that there s an answer for everything in production for use . so it came to me in a flash that is a gun for ? to shoot ! so i shot . simple is not it ?
very simple , earl .
there s nothing crazy about that , is there ?
no , earl , not at all . who sent you the flowers , earl ?
miss mollie malloy . she is a wonderful person .
is not that her picture ?
yes . is not she beautiful ?
i will not , earl .
put down that gun , earl .
yes that is right . production for use .
do not move !
sure you could , earl but you would not want to do that , would you ? you would not want to kill anybody .
no , no , you are right . i do not want to kill anybody . all i want to do is be let alone .
that is that ? only you are getting too near . i do not trust anybody .
i do not blame you , earl . if i were in your place i would not trust anybody , either .
keep away !
oh , i am awful tired . i could not go through another day like this .
well , maybe you think i could !
waking me up in the middle of the night talking to me about things they do not understand . calling me a bolshevik . i am an anarchist . it is got nothing to do with bombs . it is the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom . you see that , do not you ?
sure i do , earl .
do not cry , mollie , there s nothing to cry about .
how would you get here , earl ?
down the drainpipe . i did not mean to shoot him . you believe me , do not you , mollie ?
let em take me . it is better that way .
we will get you out in ten minutes .
they are not human !
they are newspaper men , mollie . they cannot help themselves . the lord made them that way .
it was not the lord ! it was the devil !
wait a minute , mollie .
mollie , they have not got him . you gotta help me , mollie ! we have got to do something !
what do you mean ?
quiet , mollie !
there s something funny going on around here .
ssh !
i will be right here . i will not leave you .
never mind ! just play dead .
shut up , you !
yeah , i am feeling fine .
i am a messenger at the state house . this is from the governor .
that is from the governor ?
the reprieve for earl williams .
get the governor on the phone !
you cannot get him on the phone . he is out duckshooting now .
fishing ! duckshooting ! how do you like that . a guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle he gets elected governor and right away he thinks he is tarzan !
yes , i did , just now . do not you remember ?
how much do you make a week ?
huh ?
how much do you make a week ? that is your salary ?
forty dollars .
who do you think !
the what ?
the city sealer s office !
you mean here in the city ?
yes , yes !
i could not work in the city . you see , i have got my family in the country .
but you could bring em in here ! we will pay all your expenses .
no , i do not think so .
for heavengs sake , why not ?
i got two kids going to school there , and if i changed them from one town to another , they would lose a grade .
no , they would not they would gain one ! and i guarantee that they will graduate with highest honors !
yeah ?
no , it does not . now , remember you never delivered this . you got caught in the traffic , or something . now , get out of here and do not let anybody see you .
but how do i know . . . ?
come in and see me in my office tomorrow . that is your name ?
pinkus .
all right , mr . pinkus , all you have got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut . here ! go to this address . it is a nice , homey little place , and they will take care of you for the night . just tell em fred sent you . and here s fifty dollars on account .
i will explain it tomorrow !
is it hard ?
no ! it is easy it is very easy !
you cannot bribe me !
you are insane !
a very fine looking women .
she is good enough for me ! and if i was to go home and tell my wife
i understand perfectly , mr . pinkus , and as long as i am mayor
it is a simple story . earl williams works for the e . j . mcclosky manufacturing company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years . he starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty two fifty . a year ago the mcclosky company goes out of business and williams loses his job . take it away , fred wilson !
hello , mollie .
look out where you are aiming , will you ?
yeah , hold the line . hey , this looks good . an old lady just called the detective bureau and claims williams is hiding in her cellar . well we have looked every other place . want to go out on it ?
come on , fellas .
say , hildy . . .
we want to see you .
tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun would not work , so
his honor , the mayor , now comes out with a statement that earl williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive . somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in molly malloy s joint . and this colored policeman , daniels , goes over to pick williams up . williams has read the papers , thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first . that is all .
i give that marriage six months .
baldwin . the blushing bridegroom himself .
that is he want ?

rosehill avenue . no roses . no hill . and it is certainly not an avenue .

you need trees for an avenue .
there was talk of planting some when we first came .
propaganda . we have been had .
never done better . on the fiddle . like everyone else .
except the servicemen .
naturally .
i do not understand . is there any point to it ?
there is all right . this hitter fellow . we have got to winkle him out . and get shot of some of our lot at the same time .
bugger the buffs .
i will if you will !
and i am still just a lad myself .
do not bother to grow up . it is no fun at all .
and absent bridegrooms !
and the bride .

i wish you could have told me yourself . oh , grace , it is not for long . they say it will be over by christmas .
jam .

how do we know they did not plant it there ? they know we are mad on jam . they could poison half the country .
it looks . . . . foreign .
jam is jam ! it is just jam !
you taste it .
that is it .
why did not they say that before you started ?
i was not too old when i started the course . i was too old when it finished .
what are you going to be then ?
a clerk . i am doing a typing course . i will be typing for england .
not till christmas , i do not suppose .
i have had a letter from her . they have moved house .
where to ?
fair enough . the river .
this phoney war get s on my nerves . if we are going to have a war , i wish they would get it started .
just ignore her , mac .
ancient . have you finished your homework ?
after this dance .
half the time he is bluffing .
do not be silly , dawn .
well , why do you always bring the carving knife in here ?
the ideas you get in your head .
that is why you never liked me . i am different from you . well , everything s different now , so it does not matter . so there .
it is only a joke , mummy . i am fifteen . i am still at school . i want to be a nun when i grow up .
out .

no , i will not .
there , there , my baby .
who said anything about love ?
he is being posted . i was terrible to him .
do not leave it like that . go after him . swallow your pride .
he said i was right . i should not wait for him . i was better to make a clean break .
i think it is very sensible in the circumstances .
now he is gone and made me fall in love with him , which i never wanted to do . i told him that .
it is not . it is happening to me .
could we salt them , or smoke them , do you think ?
why ? it is coming on its own . it does not hurt .
no , mother ! it is war ! war !
or what ?
up to six weeks , i think .
how are we going to cope ?
was not it lovely ?
how many of our class left ? you and me out of twenty eight .
it is just the wrench , grace . it is for their sake .
grace !
play something , grace .
. . . since i used to take you to the proms ?
that is right . not since then not since i got married .
happy days . when you are bigger , bill , i will teach you the googly .
a polish pilot . it is like one of those jokes on the wireless .
not loving enough . that is a terrible thing to do to someone . i suppose i did it to clive . always held something back .
you were never apart , you and clive . he kept asking and asking . and i waited and waited for you to say something . and you never did .
clive had a job . i did not . i could not .
we did the decent thing .
this war s put an end to decent things . i want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once , hold nothing back .
we cannot change that is past . not even the war can do that .
we did all the proper things , and we lost love . that is sad , mac .
you might still have a house .
i wish it could all have been different .
look after yourself , grace .
father , that is enough now
and . . . and . . . henry chapmangs girl , was it thelma ? no , i can see those cornflower eyes . . . i have lost your name , my sweetness .
you married that fool , clive , that is what . never mind , you can stay with us .
how long ?
and now we are glad you did .
my aunt in australia has offered . .
kids do not care . you are thinking of yourself .
i know you mean well .
i do not mind it . it was harder before the war . trying to keep up appearances . now it is patriotic to be poor .
you know something , molly ? i like it on my own . i never got used to sharing a bed , not really .
well ! i am not talking about mac . he has not toughed me for ages . and not often ever . my life started when mac went on nights .

tipsy , topsy , turvy .
happy as can be . in the old groove .

yikes .

i thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution .
i will let it slide , she was only seventeen .
dude , talk about baggage , that ai not no carry on shit , that is some heavy duty samsonite shit .

you seen this girl ? say . . . within the last hours .
hmmmmmmmmm ?
what would you see , who was she with , where were they going ?
aw , she was with some nosey , smartass high rise kids . they were poking around . . . asking stupid questions .
and i gave em directions out there , up by the old farm row . . . i figured that is the harm . stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit .
is that all . . . think real hard .
yeah , they were not here but a few minutes , did not really have time to get as up close and personal as i do with most of the assholes that wander through here .
how is about you give me those same directions .
yeah , yeah , sure . you do not have to get all true grit all over my ass . . . i will give m to ya . . . you can knock yourself silly for all i care .
enough talk , write .
hmmmmm .
shit , this ai not worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it . i was a fixing on trading it to jackie cobb .
the retard over at molly s fruit stand .
yeah , he is all hot on her after he found some of his dad s old nudie books hidden in the basement . he keeps em taped inside his school workbook .
that kid is one horny retard .
christ , ai not they all . all them retards wanna do is fuck and eat .
well , yeah . . . i think that if you knew him . . . i mean if you would understand his urges , shit the guy s like forty or something .
worse than a fucking rabid baboon .
yeah , i guess , you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes .
what ?
yeah , does not hurt himself , just spins it around next to his eyeball .
i am sure that ai not the only place he is sticking those pencils .
naw , he do not do anything else with em , but he did get caught once with a planet of the apes doll hanging out his asshole .
goddamn .
had to take him to the hospital . kid had dr . zaius stuck half way up his butt , could not get it out .
i always loved that mute broad that chuck heston was shacking up with .
nova , yeah she looked pretty sweet .
yeah , now there s the perfect woman .
can i get some stamps off ya ? did you fix the toilet yet ?
i hear ya .
yeah , i remember mr . alacard the shop teacher use ta call you little dick wick . hey , was not there a song we made up to go with that ?
no , none . i had one once , back in maybe . . . i do not know . really ai not nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more .
that is nice .
yeah , i guess i will just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters .
he should be back in a couple hours .
how is he get around out here ?
no dear , i am fine . now what kind of host would i be if i put my guests to this kind of work .
oh .
yeah , my poor baby . it is his daddy s fault . i mean earl was a good man . . . i mean he never hit me or nothing , but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all .
what happened ? oh , i am sorry , it is none of my business .
he tried to burn the house down , said it was possessed by the spirits . tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started . i do not think earl ever meant to harm us . . . but tiny was badly burnt , his ears were destroyed and most of his skin .
grab mary and come inside .
tickets for what ?
this is not everything . get ready for this . . . there s a museum of murder and mayhem .
i do not want to see that .
oh yeah , murder museum . . . sounds fun .
fried chicken . anybody want some ?
that seems likely .
hey , listen to this . . . i think this is related to our dr . satan .
oh , yeah .
yeah , in this book there s a chapter called self made freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show . it mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of borneo and shit like that , but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm less wonder .
yeah , so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree ?
it says , records show that ellie thompson was born in of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings , until such time that she was placed in the care of the willows state mental facility .
so .
now she was put in the nuthouse in at the age of .
why ?
blah , blah , blah . . . it does not say , but she was released sometime in , only to reappear as ellie bogdan , the arm less wonder . says she , criss crossed the united states constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in .
yeah ?
these dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved dr . satan working at the looney bin . i will bet he amputated her arms .
so what ?
i do not know , i just thought it was interesting .
you know what jerry , who really cares at this point ?
i do not . . . . . . i just thought it was weird .
when ?
when you were outside with bill .
thanks for coming to get us . little brother almost scared us to death .
dude , your chick s a little high strung .
yes , thank you . thank you very much .
hey , i am just waiting for cousin itt to show up .
shhhhhh .
i do not know , i think he is funny .
this is not funny , it is twisted .
shhhhhh .
think , think . try to open the lid , try to kick a hole in the wood .
i cannot . . . i cannot move my arms . i hurt so much .
i know , but we can make it out of here . we can do it .
that is not me . i did not . . . i am not doing that .
someone is out there . . . . . . help , we are in here !
help , help us .
no , nothing like that . . . yeah , we are gonna be a little late . we stopped for gas at this place called capt . spaulding s outside of ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing , so we are kind of behind schedule .
oh yeah , yeah i have driven by that place before . i seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place .
yeah , well he is still here . i think him and jerry are fast becoming buddies , you know jerry . . . yeah , he is gotta see everything . . . yeah , i know . . . thinks there s some unsolved mystery around every corner .
well , do not take too long , the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix . . . i know , i know i forgot to mention that halloween falls on a school night , so they are trick or treating tonight . . . i got the joint decked out this year , built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid .
hopefully i can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home . . . yes , dad i am kidding .
well , just promise me you will be careful . . . alright , alright see ya soon . . . good bye .

yeah , i hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady s place . watching her dance around with those ratty looking animals was ridiculous .
i know , that was some crazy shit . i never in a million years would have believed it if i had not seen it .
a decent meal every once in a while would not hurt either , this road food is crap .
if i never eat at another waffle house again , i can die a happy girl .
scattered , smothered and covered .
exactly . . . well , i guess a couple more photos will not kill me .
never . i swear to god he never sleeps , he goes to bed after me , wakes up before me . he is always working on .
maybe he is a cyborg .

oh , you are very welcome . . . lord knows how i love a man in uniform .
no , i cannot say that i ever seen em before . . . . . . he looks familiar , is he on tv ?
i ai not sure that you really need to know . it is better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs .
what ! god damn , how many ?
i am sure there s more than that . . . fucking pigs always travel in packs . . . . . . here , take this .
what should i do ?
go down stairs and play nice . . . i am a gonna go round back and handle things like i always fucking do .
who s your daddy !
yes ! i am the one who beats you when you are bad . . .
wait , i want to say good bye .
well , go get her .
george willis . . . . . . any leads ?
fit the profile ?
no , not really . good kid , never been in any trouble .
no they could not , somebody had to see something .
my denise is a smart girl , she would not do anything stupid , and her boyfriend , he always seemed like a good kid .
where we headed ?
shhhh . . . you hear that ?
over here , inside the smokehouse .
i ai not got a warrant .
shit . . . fuck procedure .
call wydell .
right .
yes , sir .
i am wydell . . . this is naish .
that is it ?
well , all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call deadwood to play nancy drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls dr . satan .
dr . satan ?
oh , yeah , you know about that ? hmmm , that is a strange one .
christ , you know it is crazy . . . i lived through so many other people s nightmares , you know . always cool and calm , but . . . but i never thought i would be the one needing help , ya know ?
i pray to god there is .
right .
i hope you are right , but my guts are telling me different .
your spidey senses tingling .
yeah . . . . . . huh , what the hell are you talking about ?
you know , your hyper sensitive spidey senses . . . like spider man . . . . . . you know , like in the comics .
how old do you think i am ? i know who the fuck spider man is . get to your point .
you know , his senses start tingling . . . when he was approaching danger and shit .
i always favored the hulk .
hulk was dumb as shit .
aw , fuck .
what .
call the chief . . . we found em .
chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house . guy s an ex cop , thinks he can help .
sounds like a bad idea to me , probally just get in the way .
yeah , well i guess it is tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid s missing . . . besides , ai not no such thing as an ex cop .
i guess not .
that must be him .
anyway , there s not much else out that way . . . so , i figure maybe there s a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms .
let s hit the road , sooner we get a move on sooner we will find her .
right . . . . . . come on .
excuse me for a second .
we found one .
uh . . . we must never act like apes , son . for you see , the ape is our closest biological relative specifically the pygmy chimp . a single chromosome separates us . but you know what truly separates us from the apes , what makes us better than apes ?
that is the wrong fork , young man .
no buts . go to your room now .
and ?
and think about what you have done .
son , your mother and i are doing a production of the gin game at the local community theater . we forgot to take off our make up .
it is going famously , son , famously !
nothing ! i will be out in a minute !
it is embarrassing , okay ?
it is not so bad . so , it just keeps growing ?
yeah , natalie . it is hair . it grows .
well , do not jump down my throat . i am just trying to help .
how is that helping , natalie ? how exactly ?
look , if you are going to be like that . . . you should be appreciative that i am interested .
why , because i am a freak and you are beautiful , and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak , nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles ?
you are fucked up , lila . why do not you fucking try electrolysis or something ? figure it out for chrissake .
hey , ma . did you bring any clothes ? i am freezing my ass off .
oui . nathangs silk suit , just like you asked .
great . god , i have wanted you forever .
gabrielle .
you remind me so much of nathan .
like father , like son .
you remind me so much of nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie .
woof .
hush . no , it is never terrible to be in love . nathangs memory lives on in our sacred union . i am not sorry she killed him either . nathan was wonderful . he was erudite and sophisticated and charming . you are all that , too . but you have something more . you have a bit of the animal in you .
french ?
oui .
oui , doctor , oui .
good morning . . . we need a name for him , do not we ?
oui .
you decide . today is your day .
really ? my day ? well , i had a sweet little mongrel puppie named puff when i was a girl . this one reminds me of my dog , all shaggy ! so cute ! i loved my doggie very much , monsieur .
puff it is then . puff bronfman . is that okay ?
oui . perfect !
good morning , puff bronfman . i am dr . bronfman and this is my assistant gabrielle . we are your mommy and daddy while you are here .
hi . i just wanted to tell you that i very much enjoy working with you . now i am embarrassed that i say this .
merci . i . . . do you . . . would you like to go get a cup of coffee , perhaps ?
well , i do not know . i am actually on my way to . . .
now i am truly embarrassed . forgive me . i should not have asked such a stupid question . i know you are a very important man and . . .
no . do not be silly . it is just . . .
i am a foolish little thing . i am pink in my face , no ? it is only that i have been so lonely lately and . . . i am ashamed . i will see you tomorrow , okay ? unless . . . am i fired now ?
not at all .
i have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man . . . but i am talking too much again , no ?
of course not .
you are so sweet . oh , why are there not more men out there like you ?
i like it when you say my name . is that stupid ?
gabrielle . no , i am sorry if i startled you . i came to think . god , did i hang up on you ?
oui . perhaps i called at a bad time . i am sorry .
no . i just got distracted . i am so sorry .
is everything fine ?
oui . now you have got me talking french .
i was in my p . j . s when i remembered i left some papers i need to go over . see ? i rushed right out of the house . i must look a mess . i am so embarrassed .
i am in my p . j . s , too . funny , huh ?
our . . . ? oh ! he seems fine . i guess we woke him . the lights and all .
i should turn them off . maybe i sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when i was a little girl .
when you were a little french girl ?
oui .
that would be good .
maybe we should just sit for a while . it is very peaceful .
it is nice , yes . i am glad i ran into you , both in our silly pajamas . it is two happy coincidences , no ?
yes . happy happy .
yet you look so sad . a great man like you should not be sad .
i am fine . life is funny , that is all .
i should not say this , but you are pretty , gabrielle . it is unprofessional , i know .
really ? i always think myself so ugly . no , not ugly , but plain . a wallflower .
really ? no . not at all . you are a very pretty girl . you should know that . you should be confident .
thank you so much . merci . it is very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment .
it is true . i would not lie .
you are sweet .
shh .
nothing , my darling . all is right with the world .
shit . hi , honey .
i do not know , nathan . what are you supposed to do ?
you do not abandon somebody because they have a physical problem .
funny . i thought that is exactly what you did . you just do not have the courage to admit it to yourself .
hmmmph .
gabby , what is it ?
hmmph . hmmph . nathan , we have to talk , you and i .
fine .
not in front of the boy .
very well .
stop . get away .
what is it ?
you have to choose nathan . it is like sophie s choice . only it is nathangs choice . did you ever see that movie , sophie s choice ? it is like that . only it is this .
gabby , you know i am trying to sort things out .
no ! it is now that you must decide . i love you , doctor nathan . . . . . . but i will not wait . i will not be your chippy . i will not be your little mademoiselle parlez vous side dish . my love . i want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly . . . from you .
but ? . . . but ? there is a but , nathan .
but i do not know how to leave lila .
unnhh .
the way you are taming him , it sends chills down my girlish spine and . . . everywhere else , too .
urgh .
take me , darling ! tame your little monkey of love !
hi . it is nathan .
i just want to talk .
we have nothing to say ! you are a rotten bastard , that is what !
why ? you have made your decision , mister stinky american ! now i hate you ! no , i do not hate you i do not even think about you !
i have got some things to tell you .
well , i think it would be easier if i could talk to you in person .
what for ?
you think too much . i need a man who does not think so much but acts more than he thinks . . . is what i need !
what ?
you heard me ! you make me sick when you pretend to not understand what i am saying to you ! go away from here !
well , look , i am sorry to have bothered you .
god , you are beautiful .
please . i look a mess .
no . you look so beautiful .
anyway . come already to the point .
i am . . . i am going to leave lila . i cannot stop thinking about you .
i have moved on .
no !
i have been seeing johannsen in chemistry .
that goddamn neanderthal ? i am the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray sun screen ! did you know that ? !
that is not how he tells it .
of course not , that swedish thief ! he is a thief of hearts ! i love you , gabrielle .
hunh .
just give me some time to let lila down easily . she is a really nice girl and i do not want to hurt her more than is necessary .
you hurt me , you know , when you made nathangs choice . does that not even matter to you , you pig ?
was i ? i was not a tad stiff ?
do not be silly ! and you were wonderful , too ! i loved the way you said au revoir .
terrific . we are all going to be rich and famous .
that is lila ?
i do not know . something s missing .
i do not know .
oui .
that bitch . i worked so hard . we worked so hard , you and i . he would have made us famous .
we still have you and i .
i know . and that is great . but it would be great in a better way , not a better way but a different way , if i could find him and bring him back .
where do we look for little lost puff ?
i have some thoughts . i think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape .
that is horrible . apes are dirty . no ?
you better believe they are dirty ! and smelly ! and messy ! and they do not know their forks from their assholes !
okay , my sweet . good night .
a little resistance would be nice , damn it .
please let me go with you .
no .
okay .
it is okay , puff .
sha not happen again .
it is an animal urge , puff . it is nothing to be ashamed of .
very well .
but i like being human now .
i want to be the way i was before .
good . i will show you how , apey .
talking is to be kept to a minimum . eventually , when we are ready , there will be none . language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves . there is no other reason .
what an enchanting picture you paint of our future together .
we bury the body . we disappear into the woods . nobody knows .
no . this is the end of the road . there s a dead human being here . for all of his faults , he was a human being , and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody .
forget him , lila . we will disappear . we will never talk about it again . we will never talk again period . i love you .
puff , what happened to you is as much my fault as nathangs . maybe more so , because i knew it was wrong and i went along with it anyway . i am taking responsibility for the murder . i want you to go back to your old life .
i will not let you do that . i shot the bastard . and i am glad .
no . go back to the woods . this is a sacrifice i need to make . in my world we have something called penance . it is another abstraction , but i had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent . it does not exist for you , and it should not . see , i could never be free again anyway , so i might as well be in jail .
then i will live for both of us , lila . i will be the most free , truest animal in the whole forest . for both of us .
that is what i am counting on .
but first i will live among them , just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind .
okay . if you think it will help .
ouch . yeah ?
oh yes , honey . getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over . smooth as a baby s butt .
i love it , rose . i am getting to be a real girl .
you still in the market for a real boy ?
always . ow .
cause there s this guy . my brother knows him . might be right up your alley .
tell me . i could use someone up my alley .
i do not get that . is that sexual ?
shut up and tell me .
handsome , thirties , psychologist . . .
loves animals ? ouch . must love animals , rose .
loves animals . loves you .
what do you mean ?
somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine . mr . handsome , animal loving psychologist said he would love to meet you .
holy shit . your brother did not tell him about the nature of our relationship , did he ?
my brother is discreet .
will not he be able to tell ?
my brother says the guy s a thirty five year old virgin , so maybe he will not know how women usually feel . plus he is got bad eyesight , almost legally blind , which is helpful in this situation . plus he is got an extremely small penis , of which he is mortifyingly ashamed , so chances are he will be so grateful for any non judgmental attention , that he will be yours forever .
god , he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff .
yeah , well my brother is his shrink .
i really like him , rose . he is so . . . . . . passionate about his work .
my brother says he likes you , too .
really ?
yeah . says he likes you even more than he likes his own mother . and according to my brother nathangs abormally close with his mother .
i cannot believe how in love i am with this man .
yeah ?
he is so cute . i even like his cute little penis . it is like a little pig s penis or something . rose , we connect on every level . i have finally found someone i can feel completely safe with .
do not throw that away . i had that once with a guy . but i threw it away for a cheap thrill .
one night stand ?
no . i married a midget .
marrying a midget was a cheap thrill ?
well he was not really a midget . he was on the cusp of midgethood . that is what made it cheap . had he been an actual midget , there would have been nothing cheap about it , my dear .
i did not know you were into that sort of thing .
let me tell you , honey , midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship . they are portable . they are controllable . they are eager . and they are exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor .
i have a friend you might like to meet .
oh ?
three foot one .
be still my crotch .
rose , nathangs no midget , but he is asked me to move in with him .
yeah . my brother told me .
and i think i am going to .
stand on a stepladder sometimes .
lila , it is rosie .
go the fuck away , rosie .
please , honey , let me in .
rose , please go away .
lila , i want to help you .
nathan told my brother .
your brother should have his license revoked .
yeah , although i am not going to turn him in . i like hearing the dirt .
why did not your brother tell you that nathan was having an affair ?
oh , rosie .
let s get you out of here . come stay with me until you get your strength back . free electrolysis , if you want it ! we will get that face of yours cleared up in no time .
ready !
with pleasure .
oh , rosie .
and i am going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me .
shut up , you .
i am really glad you two found each other .
no you will not . but it is okay . you have stuff you gotta do .
thank you so much . i love slugs . all slugs , not just banana slugs .
as do i .
they are so even keel . they forge ahead with slow determination . they do not get distracted or side tracked . they do not care what they look like . they do not care that people look at them and go , ewww . a slug .
they do not seem to be especially ego driven , this is true .
you have got to respect that .
i have to say that i am not there yet .
where ?
slugdom . sluggishness . whatever you would call it . i am not there yet . i still have many human characteristics .
that is not necessarily a bad thing .
yes . i suppose not . but still . one would like to move along . to move beyond .
i am not sure we can escape our natures . believe me i have tried . i am not even so sure anymore that we should want to .
i love that you said that . it makes me feel a bit lighter . i have been rather heavy lately . thinking about my childhood . realizing how much a product i am of my upbringing . i have been seeing someone . a therapist .
you are a therapist , right ?
no no . i am a psychologist , but i do research . i am a behaviorist . i work with animals . mice at the moment .
i hope you do not perform any of those dreadful torture experiments , nathan .
heavens no . my work now is . . . right now i am teaching mice . . . well , table manners , to be candid .
how is it going ?
quite well , really . it is a lot of work . a lot of reinforcement , mostly positive . right now i have gotten two of my subjects to use napkins . tiny napkins of course .
paper or cloth ?
i hope you do not think me daft . it is important work . it is part of a larger sociological experiment . i am federally funded .
that is the larger experiment ?
it is my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice , they can be taught to humans .
going out on a limb , are not you , nathan ?
the truth is most people do not have table manners today . and when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear , civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels .
i am not sure .
courtesy , decorum , manners , are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse . rudeness , vulgarity , meanness are the norm .
we are animals after all .
ergo if i can teach table manners to mice , i can teach them to humans . if i can teach table manners to humans , i can save the world .
you look wonderful . i am on top of the world tonight , lila . work is going splendidly and my personal life is . . .
my god ! the fork ! the fork !
i am sorry ?
tell her , harold . . . it is just that . . . it is nothing . it is just that the outside fork is the salad fork . one goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses .
oh , i am sorry . i am sorry , nathan . i never really learned those things .
no biggie .
i am sorry that i became so upset .
no , i am sorry . i am really backward in certain areas .
it is only that i really enjoy your company and . . .
you do ?
yes , and . . .
you really enjoy my company ?
yes . please do not talk with food in your mouth , lila . please . you are so pretty and it only mars your . . . i am sorry . i am being critical .
i like you , too , nathan .
you do ?
yeah but i have some peculiarities also .
i do not care . i do not care ! like what , for example ?
nathan !
i will be out in a minute .
i am sorry about my parents .
you did not seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother s stupid , tasteless , cruel animal jokes .
i was simply attempting to keep the evening light . you know that i feel similarly to you about nature .
do you ?
of course . i simply love the . . . naturalness of it all .
why certainly !
that is a great idea .
terrific . cannot wait !
i do not think so . why ?
yes , darling .
oh , and the sun block ?
of course .
what spf , sweetie ?
fifteen .
perfectomundo ! we are ready ! say , would not it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block ? think of all the time one would save .
yes , darling .
i think i will get johannsen in chemistry on that . oh ! did you bring the first aid kit ?
yes .
flares ?
absolutely .
we could call it quit bugging me , sunny . get it ? sunny . s u n n y .
that is very funny .
i love you so much .
what ?
i do not know . something .
a deer ?
no . too . . . upright . might have been a person .
it might behoove us to turn back at this point .
if it is a person , why should we go see it ? it is not like it is nature or anything . it is just a person . sometimes people who live in the woods do not want to be seen . they live in the woods because they are anti social , lila . we have to respect that .
i think he is feral .
feral ? do not touch him ! he might be diseased ! he might . . . my god , rabies !
he looks perfectly fine .
i think we should go . please . before he wakes up and , i do not know , eats us , or whatever feral things do .
i do not understand you . this is fascinating and you just want to run away . i mean , here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization , totally free , and all you want to do is run back to your . . .
actually , i just had an amusing thought .
what ?
feral , huh ? totally uncontaminated ?
look at him . he does not understand english . he moves like an animal .
it is perfect !
nathan , what the hell are you talking about ?
forget mice ! actually forget guinea pigs , cats , monkeys , and chimps also . i am on to stage five the human subject .
oh no . you cannot take him from his home , nathan .
do not you see ? he is my tabula rasa , my eliza dolittle . he is my ticket to the top of the behaviorist food chain . he is going to make me famous .
i will not allow you . it is wrong . he is happy here .
is he , lila ? is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness ? never to know the love of a good woman , never to revel in the pitter patter of little feet , never to read moby dick , or marvel at a monet , or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work , smoke a pipe , and wonder about the nature of reality .
you would be taking away his freedom , nathan .
freedom s just another word for nothing left to lose , lila , to quote janet jackson .
all right .
great . grab his feet . we will throw him in the trunk .
nothing . be right out .
uh huh . right , gabrielle . right .
absolutely , gabrielle . someone from work ! sorry about that , gabrielle . uh huh . exactly .
excuse me one second , would you , gabrielle ?
your entire body ?
i am getting electrolysis . it is working , but it takes time . so meanwhile i have to . . .
you have to shave ? like an ape ?
apes do not shave , you son of a bitch !
do not quibble . you know what i mean .
i am sorry . please do not be mad at me for this .
mad ? i am i am . . . disgusted !
i am the same person i was before you knew , damn it ! oh god !
i have to think ! i have to think !
you are an animal .
really ? wow ! that is that is terrific to hear from someone so . . . feminine , so female .
i love being female because it , how do you say , allows me to be close to men .
i am glad you are female . do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene ?
good . making progress .
honey , can we talk tonight ? you know , about stuff ? things have been so strained for the past three weeks , since you know , and i just want to talk .
please , nathan . i really need this . you have been working late a lot .
of course not .
it would just be helpful to know .
no .
because , you know , you seem so distant . and you work late every night . and we hardly ever have sex , and when we do , it is . . . i do not know . it feels different .
i am just preoccupied .
do you like my new look ?
yeah . it is nice . it is really good .
i am trying , you know . i am trying to be what you want . i want to be what you want , nathan . all i want is to be what you want .
shh . it is okay . it is okay , lila . you are what i want . you know that . you are exactly what i want .
really ?
sure . of course .
because i am really trying , you know . rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis .
that is great .
i have signed up for a ballet class . and look at my nails ! a real girl !
oh , nathan , let s have a baby !
. . . the back door of a movie theater . yes , indeed .
you remember that from my book ? i am touched ! that is wrong ?
nothing . hard day . gonna have a drink .
i will make it . i am so happy , nathan ! everything s going to be so great ! scotch on the rocks , right ? just kidding . i know what you drink , mister . i know what you drink . voila !
cruddy , okay ? are you satisfied ?
no . i do not want your work to be cruddy .
my assistant quit today . okay ? he was highly valuable to the project .
oh , baby . i am sorry . cannot you hire somebody else ?
i guess .
have you ?
oh yes , baby ! i think that this is a wonderful project you are doing , taking this poor unfortunate , uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being ! what a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are !
really ?
yes ! and i want to help . you will not have to pay me , and i was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway .
how come ?
who needs it ? i have you and i have being a woman and i have thinking about womanly things ! i love being a woman because . . .
such as what womanly things ?
such as my man and how to please him ! such as making wonderful dinners for my man ! such as looking pretty for my man ! and i am writing an article on quilting for the ladies home journal !
i had sold my fucking soul .
i let her sell her soul . i stood by as she did it . it is inexcusable . at the time though i thought it might help .
that was wonderful !
oh boy !
thank you very much for that .
absolutely !
should i come with ?
nah . you just relax . how is the book ?
ummm . it is good .
yeah . puff and i got into a big , philosophical discussion . he is really quite well read , considering he is only been literate for a month now . he is going to make us famous , lila .
so he is doing okay ?
seemed fine . quiet evening enjoying his new digs .
that is funny because , you know , i just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside . he called here when he ran out of his mad money after spending an entire evening drinking , watching strippers , and fucking a whore ! oh , and what did you do tonight , honey ?
shit .
and what did you do tonight , honey ?
i have fallen in love with somebody else , lila .
and what did you do tonight , honey ?
i fucked her ! okay ? i fucked her . i am sorry . but that is what the hell i did .
do you know what i gave up to be with you ?
yes .
i gave up my soul , my beliefs . i gave up my body hair !
yeah , well , i am sorry . the human heart is a strange thing .
how the hell would you know anything about the human heart ?
lila . . .
lila , you do not intend to hurt us , do you ?
eat shit , thumbtack dick ! thank you , frank . you are the best .
ugnh .
oook . oook .
shut up ! i gave you . . . life . i created you in my image , puff . i took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners . and this is how you repay me ? by heading back to the ooze first chance you get ? i should leave you here with lila the ape woman . it would serve you right , you ungrateful piece of crap . but i am not going to . you are too valuable to me . totally selfish of me . you serve my purpose . but if you had any smarts you would realize that i serve your purpose as well . life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit .
ooka .
do not worry , lila . you can stay . i do not have any interest in you anymore . c mon , monkey boy .
bravo , puff ! bravo !
now , puff , we are leaving on the electronic collar . i do not think we will need to shock you , but just in case .
okay . that is fair .
i am loving this . it is such a treat to be out and about . what a wonderful invention a city is . the immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun , the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks , the colorful street vendors .
humor me , puff . it is essential that i am able to trust you to function independently in the world .
i bow to your expertise in these matters .
lila ?
yahoo !
tomorrow , the acid test .
and because you did so well , we have a little surprise for you .
extra dessert ?
even better .
it is wonderful ! do you think i am ready ? do you really ?
i trust that you will make good , mature decisions . i trust that you will do the proper thing .
oh , i will ! your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me . i do not want to disappoint you .
good . remember , when in doubt do not ever do what you really want to do .
got it .
it would be my pleasure , doctor . distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community , i stand before you today , a living testament to the amazing skill of dr . nathan bronfman . to say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement . dr . bronfman took me from playing with my own feces , then to crayons , and then to an appreciation of the complex works of franz kline , joseph beuys , and marcel duchamp . from compulsive masturbation to . . .
thanks to you , buddy . and your diligence and intelligence and perseverance .
here , here .
now , my diminutive friend , what can i do for you ?
oh please , is that as articulate as you can be after all the time i spent teaching you ? we have discussed wittgenstein , for christ s sake . not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject .
unn .
down from the tree . both of you . keep your hands where i can see them . do not want you pulling any weapons out of your fur .
ounpoo . ungh .
let s be reasonable human beings here . we are all reasonable human beings , are not we ?
unka unka unka unka unka .
look , why do not you and lila stay here and have your natural life . i will just go on my way . you will never see me again .
i have to talk . is that okay ?
no .
do you suppose it has anything to do with lila s unusually hairy body ?
no , why ?
well , it seems that since lila broached the subject of children , you have been on edge and i know you have an issue with the , uh , body hair .
oh , i see . yes , that is something to think about . that is very good . that is what you get the big bucks , right ? ha ha .
i just think it might be important to explore your feelings for lila .
i love lila . i mean , she is a wonderful person . and . . . she loves me ! that is no small potatoes . i mean she really loves me . she is sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me . and she is a good person . a truly good person . how rare is that in this world , eh ? and how could i stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection , if it can even be called that . i mean , god knows i am not perfect ! what about my eyesight ? it is lousy , that is what ! lila s not going to leave me because of my eyesight . what about my penis ?
and how do you feel about gabrielle ?
yes ?
i saw you on c span . i have been looking for you for thirty years . then there you were , such a beautiful , beautiful grown man .
yes . . . derek .
yes , i suppose so . i suppose i knew that was going to be what you would say . it is good to see you again though .
yes .
i am in the book , if you ever want to drop me a line or something .
i am an ape , mom . i am an ape . and apes do not drop lines .
yep .
pittsburgh ?
mm hmm .
coming in or going out ?
going in . we got a sales convention . gotta be there tomorrow .
what do you guys sell ?
hey , he is right ! whaddya say , charlie , huh ? play a little pool ? wait out the heat ?
next game , ten bucks .
you want a chaser ?
no .
check !
you look different . . . more relaxed .
right .
it is open . . . what will you have ?
packard . sarah packard .
it always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind . are you sure you do not want anything ?
no , i am fine .
you , uh , you ever been to louisville during derby week , miss , ah , packard ?
i have never been to louisville .
lots of action . lots of money . lots of class . you will see some of the best dressed and most beautiful women in the world at the races . knock your eye out .
soon as i finish my coffee .
i know . been there myself . we have all been there , have not we , miss packard ?
oh , i forgot all about it . how is the hands ?
that is right , miss packard .
and a fact is a fact .
she is a smart girl , eddie .
we are neighbors now . you can call me sarah .
do we need words ?
yeah , i think we do . we could try to cut each other up . but that would be bad for everybody . bad for me , bad for you . and worst of all , be bad for eddie .
you know that is good for him ?
to win .
for whom and for what ?
for what makes the world go round . for money , and for glory .
you did not answer my first question . for whom ?
all right . today for me , tomorrow for himself .
no , there s no tomorrow . not with you . you own all the tomorrows because you buy them today , and you buy cheap .
well , nobody has to sell .
listen , miss ladybird , you are here on a rain check and i know it . you are hanging on by your nails . you let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for eddie and you are a wreck on a railroad track . you are a horse that finished last . so do not make trouble , miss ladybird . live and let live . while you can .
how ?
you tell me .
thank you .
it is what eddie wants . he , uh , told me to give you some money .
that is the way it is done .
and the way you are looking at me , is that the way you look at a man you have just beaten ? as if you would just taken his money , and now all you want is . . . his pride ?
all i want s the money .
sure , sure , just the money , and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart . you are a roman , bert . you have to win them all .
well , mr . felson , maybe you could come out to my place some evening . we could play a few games of billiards .
good , good .
you ever played billiards before ?
deal the cards .
oh , about five hundred .
do you really think you can beat him ?
of course he thinks he can beat me , bert . he would not be playing me if he did not . right , felson ?
i did not ask him can he beat you . i already know he can beat you . i asked him will he ? with eddie , that is two different things .
it is possible .
the night is two thousand dollars old .
cash .
how much do i owe you ?
twelve thousand .
the name s gordon . bert gordon .
mister . you been sitting in that spot for hours . would you mind moving ? it bothers me .
what did he say ?
sit down .
cut .
deal .
two .
thought you only drank milk .
only when i work .
yeah ? why ?
i like it . it is good for you . besides , you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing . that is something you do not need an excuse for losing . how did you make out in the poker game ?
i lost twenty bucks .
poker s not your game .
what is ?
pool .
you being cute ?
i do not think there s a pool player alive shoots better pool than i saw you shoot the other night at ames . you got talent .
so i got talent . so what beat me ?
character .
yeah . sure , sure .
you are damned right i am sure . everybody s got talent . i got talent . you think you can play big money straight pool , or poker , for forty straight hours on nothing but talent ? you think they call minnesota fats the best in the country just cause he is got talent ? nah . minnesota fats s got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body .
i got drunk .
he drank as much whisky as you did .
maybe he knows how to drink .
you bet he knows how . you think that is a talent too , huh ? knowing how to drink whisky ? you think minnesota fats was born knowing how to drink ?
okay , okay . . . what do i do now , lie down on the floor and , uh , bow from the ankles ? what do i do , go home ?
that is your problem .
so i stay . stay until i hustle up enough to play fats again . maybe by that time i will develop myself some character .
a thousand .
no , three thousand at least . he will start you off at five hundred a game he will beat the pants off you . that is the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is . he will beat you flat four or five games maybe more , depending on how , uh . . . steady your nerves are . but he might he just might be a little scared of you , and that could change things . but i would not count on it .
how do you know ? huh ? when nobody knows that much ?
see that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in ? well , that is mine . i like that car . but i get a new one every year because i make it my business to know what guys like you and minnesota fats are gonna do . i made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over .
in that case , you owe me another drink .
whaddya been so far ?
eddie , you are a born loser .
that is that supposed to mean ?
first time in ten years i ever saw minnesota fats hooked , really hooked . but you let him off .
i told you . i got drunk .
sure , you got drunk . that is the best excuse in the world for losing . no trouble losing when you got a good excuse . and winning ! that can be heavy on your back too . like a monkey . you drop that load too when you got an excuse . all you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself . it is one of the best indoor sports feeling sorry for yourself a sport enjoyed by all , especially the born losers .
thanks for the drink .
wait a minute . maybe i can help you .
to do what ?
get the three thousand . play minnesota fats again .
why ?
ten reasons . maybe fifteen . and also there s something in it for me .
oh yeah , i figured that . how much ?
seventy five per cent .
for who ?
for me .
that is a that is a pretty big slice . who do you think you are , general motors ?
how much you think you are worth these days ? i am putting up the money , i am putting up the time . for that i get seventy five per cent return on my money if you win .
you think i can lose ?
i never saw you do anything else .
you saw me beat minnesota fats for eighteen thousand dollars .
look , you wanna hustle pool , do not you ? this game is not like football . nobody pays you for yardage . when you hustle you keep score real simple . the end of the game you count up your money . that is how you find out who s best . that is the only way .
why back me then ? why not back yourself ? go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich . you know all the angles .
i am already rich . but i like action . that is one thing i think you are good for is action . besides , like i say . . . you got talent .
yeah , you already told me that . you cut that slice down to bite size and maybe we can talk .
no , we do not talk . i do not make bad bets . seventy five , twenty five . that is it .
kiss off .
there are places . i will scuffle around .
word s out on you , eddie . you walk in the wrong kind of place and they will eat you alive .
now , when did you adopt me ?
i do not know when it was .
hi . how is business ?
ahh , slow . . . why the open hand bridge ? something wrong with your hand ?
yeah . had a little accident . a place called arthur s .
oh . you seem to do all right that way .
i would say my game is about twenty per cent off . maybe more .
what happened ? somebody step on your hands ?
yeah . big creep . broke my thumbs .
man named turk baker ?
you know everybody , do not you ?
everybody who can hurt me , everybody who can help me . it pays .
maybe you oughta give me lessons .
sign up .
where do i sign ?
the first match i got in mind for you is in louisville , kentucky .
you name the place , boss . i will be there .
what happened to you anyway ?
like i told ya . my thumbs .
no , i do not mean the thumbs . you already told me about the thumbs .
i been thinking .
thinking about what ?
maybe i am not such a high class piece of property right now . and a twenty five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothing .
hey , get us a couple of drinks here , will ya ? j . t . s . brown .
miss packard . how do you do ?
what ? and he he hustles pool ?
he is a gentleman . gentleman gambler . he gets his kicks playing with hustlers . he is got an old southern mansion with a pool table in the basement , drinks eight year old bourbon , smokes cork tipped cigarettes .
how good is he ?
i do not know . never saw him play . they say he is one of the best .
i do not . but i got confidence in findley .
that is that supposed to mean ?
means i got confidence that he is a loser . all the way a loser . you happen to be about only one half loser the other half , winner . i am finished .
no , no . when you play for me , i pick up all the tabs .
i played that game , bert . in my head i played it a thousand times .
play it again . learn something . fats went in the john , see ? washed his face , cleaned his fingernails , made his mind a blank , combed his hair , came back all ready to go . you were through . you saw him , you saw how he looked . clean , all set to start all over again . hold tight and push hard . you know what you were doing ? you were waiting to get beat . flattened out on your butt , swimming around in glory . and whisky . probably deciding how you could lose .
good . i would hate to think i was putting my money on a cripple .
hey , whaddya say something like that for ?
come on , let s go . . .
where ?
over there by the bar .
nah . sit tight . he will be over here .
well , i win sometimes .
it is all right . she had a little too much to drink , that is all . forget it . go upstairs and sleep it off .
c mon , bert . let me play him .
how much ?
you hustling me ?
about even .
when do i raise the bet ?
i do not know .
bert , if that is his best game , i can beat him .
level with me , eddie . you ever play billiards before ?
that is the difference ? you got a pool cue , balls on the table . all you gotta do is get the feel of it .
all right . five hundred .
how are the hands ?
they are fine .
well , rack up your cue . we are leaving .
i said we are leaving .
i do not believe you , eddie . i think you are still a loser .
all right , then . i will play him with my own money .
i know when to quit . you do not . win or lose , you do not know when to quit .
what do you want me to do , huh ? what do you want me to do ? just say it and you got it but please do not get off me now .
it is a long walk .
i got time , bert .
you want me to tell her for you ?
tell her what ?
you gotta be hard , eddie .
and just how do you figure that , bert ? what do you figure i owe you ?
half .
in louisville it was seventy five per cent .
well , here it is half .
what if i do not pay ya , bert ?
you do not pay me ? you gonna get your thumbs broken . and your fingers . and if i want them to , your right arm in three or four places .
i am a businessman , kid .
well , you got a lot of games lined up for me ?
yeah , we are gonna make a lotta money together , from now on .
fifty per cent ?
no , it do not have to be fifty . it can be thirty . . . twenty five .
we really stuck the knife in her , did not we , bert ?
aaaahhhh !
boy , we really gave it to her good .
if it did not happen in louisville , it would happened someplace else . if it did not happen now , it would happen six months from now . that is the kinda dame she was .
and we twisted it , did not we , bert ? course , maybe that does not stick in your throat cause you spit it out just like you spit out everything else . but it sticks in mine . i loved her , bert . i traded her in on a pool game . but that would not mean anything to you . because who did you ever care about ? just win , win , you said , win , that is the important thing . you do not know what winning is , bert . you are a loser . cause you are dead inside , and you cannot live unless you make everything else dead around ya .
no . hell , no ! you eddie felson ?
who s he ?
that is your game ? what do you shoot ?
you name it , we shoot it .
look , friend , i am not trying to hustle . i do not never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels . do not try to hustle me .
okay , i am eddie felson . i shoot straight pool . you got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom ?

okay . . . okay . nobody can beat you .
ten grand ! i mean , what other poolroom is there in the country where a guy can walk out with ten grand in one night ? jeez , you know , i can remember hustling an old man for a dime a game .

what do you want me to do ? just sit here and wait ? faithful little sarah . pull the shades down and sit . when you feel like coming back , you will come back . and you will love me . and then you will go away again . is that your idea of love ?
i got no idea of love . and neither have you . i mean , neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street .
i would know it , eddie . i would know . for god s sakes , what are you trying to do to me ? i love you .
well , that is your idea of love ? chains ?
no . i made you up , did not i , eddie ? you were not real . i made you up , like everything else . there was no car crash , eddie . when i was five , i had polio . i was never an actress . the rich old man is my father . he walked out on us when i was seven . he sends me a check every month . that is how he buys his way out of my life . the men i have known . . . after they left , i would say they were not real , i made them up . but you , eddie . i wanted you to be real .

you are not them .
you hunt us like animals do you know how many you have slaughtered ? !
i only protect myself !
you are the human . the hunter . the thing that comes in the day and kills
if i am a hunter it is because you taught me to be !
what do you mean ?

yes .
yes .
he wanted me to see he thinks i was infected by you .
shhh . . . do not talk .
i want to talk . i just learned again .
i will go . we will both go . far away .
busy . i went swimming and prepared a new vehicle . a big vehicle .
that sounds charming . did you meet any interesting people today ?
yesterday . they are back . have not seen them for a few months . i have to be careful .
tell me about the interesting people you met , will not you ?
they are . . . sinister . they want to kill me .
that sounds charming . what are you planning to do tomorrow ?

it was at diane s party in malibu and i had just broken up with todd and i was loaded for bear , any man who had the nerve to come at me watch out . so you come sauntering in you know that saunter you do . that watch out , baby , here comes mr . smooth thing .
yeah , but when your mother came that is the first thing you showed her ?
i surrender
besides , if we get a lot of work done this summer it will be done .
it is never gonna be done . you love puttering out there too much .
well , it is not supposed to be done anyway .
virginia . . . ?
what ?
please .
only got one kind .
that is fine .
you got that right .
i am am architect . i am working on a site back in
you built things .
i guess you could say that .
round back .
yes .
do we have to ?
i know , son . but you will like it where we are going . i am getting a good job . it is a pretty part of the country .
i will have to go to a new school again .
you will meet new friends . i know . . . it is rough . but i have to move , son .
that is the air force base .
this can be your room if you want it . what do you say ?
is the hill ours too ?
if we want it , it is .
let s check it out , dad .
it is got a name . copper ridge . there used to be a copper mine near here .
let s see that is on the other side . maybe we will find some copper .
it is that time of year again . we should get a pretty good show out here .
why , dad ?
because the sky is so clear out here .
this should be the heaviest shower of the year .
there s cassius . . .
and that one to the right of rigel ?
that is mars . the closest planet to us , now . that is why it is more than just a point in the sky .
okay .
you have got to come see a big thing went down over the hill !
what did it look like ?
it was it was it changed shape . first it was big and round , then it was flat , then it was long and thin .
i do not know , dad . but it was big .
i will go take a look when the rain lets off .
sure . . . fine .
was there anything over the hill ?
what , jim , what ?
first lemme look at your necks .
that is a doozy of a dream , son .
it was so real , dad .
it was all made of stuff that is happened to you in the last few days . the sand pit in back of the house , and the meteor shower , and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school , and being afraid of the new kids because you do not know them . . .
i was so scared .
better now , son ?
i will take you to school .
you do not have to . the school bus stops right outside here , at . i have got to run .
i will . but is not that odd about my dream . . . ?
that is ed . ed works with the bell telephone switching division .
where is your car ?
i left it at work .
you did ? why ? where were you ? they said you left hours ago . we were worried .
yes but . . .
george , you are acting very strangely .
it is his nightmare . he still has not gotten over it . . . about the other side of the hill .
good night .
yes , mr . gardner .
i am sorry , mr . gardner . i was out of my office for a minute and when i got back he was gone .
he was upset with moving , i believe .
is that all he said ?
why , yes . why ?
i understand , miss , that you have my son in your office .
yes , i do , mr . gardner .
may i ask why ?
we were having a little talk .
about what ?
children often have trouble adjusting to a new school .
i do not know what he is told you what u has u he told you ? would you like to tell u me u ?
mr . gardner , i
you people have a lot of nerve , taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn . i am of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle . . . what sort of training do you have anyway ?
mr . gardner , i do not think this is the place to discuss this matter .
i am not particularly interested , u ms . u magnuson , in what you think is correct . my wife and i are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want jimmy with us . keep him in your office until we arrive .
of course .
no .
why not ? moving is hard for anybody . was it hard for you to leave all your friends ?
i do not have many friends . dad s all the time moving .
can you tell me about that ?
yes .
a ufo lands in back of your house and puts something in your dad and mom s necks . then it gets the police , and your teacher too .
she said the frog came from around the copper ridge . she must have been behind the hill .
what would you think if somebody told you a story like this ?
i would believe him .
why ?
cause he would not lie .
yes . i can even read star maps .
this shows how to get to my home . i am giving you back roads and footpaths , so there s less chance of you being seen .
i got trapped in mrs . mckeltch s van and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them behind my house . i saw them .
where , jimmy ?
behind my house , up on the ridge .
if we go and look and there s nothing there , you will have to admit to me that this is all in your mind .
i do not see anything .
no , but it was here .
but it is not , jimmy .
no .
let s go look at the sand pit behind your house .
we will be very careful . but we have to see . if something landed there , there would be a big scar in the ground . would not there ?
maybe it landed in the bushes .
who are you calling ?
the state police .
all their lines were busy .
hide the car .
i know a way .
i do not know . i do not know what i am doing here
yes . . . yes , but i am not sure what i saw anymore .
i am not . they must be tunneling under the whole town .
we cannot do this alone . we have got to get help .
there was a man named colonel wilson , from the air force base . he was talking in our class . he said we could visit him any time we wanted . i will bet he could do something .
let s try .
they did not find any signs of life on the viking missions .
mom this is the best show all year .
i know . but you have a full day of school tomorrow you , too .
no , mom . it was not a plane .
what happened to your other slipper ?
what ? i . . .
the back door was open .
what ?
do not go over the hill , mom . please .
this afternoon . it is wonderful up there you still have not seen the best part .
i have school .
i will pack us a lunch . hamburgers . you always like that , do not you .
what kind , mom ?
oh , i cannot remember . but people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed .
gardner ? oh , um he is a new student . just moved here . why ?
his teacher brought him in to see me . said he would been acting up in class . creating a disturbance . i could not get a thing out of him .
oh ?
that is his family background ?
they are from out of state . father s an engineer at the nuclear power plant . i really do not know much about them .
why , yes .
jimmy s father is on the phone . i wonder if you would take the call .
all right . i will be right back .
it is really nice of you to help us .
i wish i could do more but we are moving out .
we are going with you . i mean , we are going too .
cool .
if we do , we will both die virgins . but at last we will be together .
you have to leave the white house .
this is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion .
you do not understand . you have to leave washington .
i have worked with embedded loading . they are communicating with a hidden signal . they are going to attack . . .
you are being paranoid .
it is not paranoia . the embedding is very subtle . it is probably been overlooked . . .
connie , do not hang up .
david ? how would you get this number ?
walk to the window . right in front of you .
fifty six minutes , forty five seconds .
i want you to leave with us . right now .
i cannot leave . we have to tell this to the president .
he is not going to listen to me .
david , do not . . .
i take it you have heard .
a toast to the end of the world .
he is a good man .
better be . you left me for him .
i wanted a career . did not you ever want to be part of something special ?
we will be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off .
if anything goes wrong i will have to think quickly , adjust the signal , who knows ?
did it work ?
you bet it did .
punched the president ? oh my god .
my ex husband works in satellite communications .
think nothing of it , spanky .
all he could think about was getting to you . there s still love there i think .
love was never our problem .
all you need is love . john lennon . smart man . shot in the back , very sad .
more than likely .
he used to run the nasa . he knows where all the bones are buried . comes in handy .
i will bet .
i could have evacuated the cities hours ago . you know , when i flew in the gulf war everything is simple . we knew what we had to do . it is not simple anymore , connie . a lot of people died today . how many did not have to ?
then get them out of there .
it was turned on . i was ignoring you . that is the big emergency ?
started this morning . every channel is making like it is nineteen fifty . snow , static , all kinds of distortions . no one knows what the hell is going on .
so sue me .
please , would i be this panicked if it was that simple ?
we have tried . it is not working . it is almost as though they were not even there .
that is the bad news ?
you are in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch .
and the good news is you will not charge me .
no . the good news is i found the problem and it is not our equipment . there s some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed .
that is the good news ?
. . . and we will be the only guys in town with a clear picture ? that is my man .
huh ? oh , good , good .
strange thing is , if my calculations are right it will be gone in approximately seven hours anyway . the signal reduces itself every time it recycles . eventually it will disappear . are you listening ?
can you believe this ?
what are you talking about ?
have not you been watching ?
what happened ?
just do it !
remember i told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction .
not really . . .
that signal . it is a countdown .
a countdown to what ?
think . it is like in chess . first you strategically position your pieces . then , when the timing s right . you strike .
checkmate .
i am thinking .
so think already .
you do not move soon . i will begin to decompose .
dad , do not start .
i am only saying , it is been what ? four years , you still have not signed your divorce papers .
three years .
three , four . move on . it is not healthy .
the television said they have started with the looting already . vultures .
you still got the olds ?
you want to borrow the car ? you do not have a license .
that is okay . you are driving .
cannot this thing go any faster ?
you think they do not know what you know ? believe me , they know . she works for the president . they know everything .
they do not know this .
and you are going to educate them ? tell me something , you are so smart how come you spent eight years at m . i . t . to become a cable repairman ?
dad . . .
all i am saying is they have got people who handle these things , david . they want hbo , they will call you .
this , pops , is every phone book in america .
you think an important person like constance is going to be listed ?
she always keeps her portable phone listed , for emergencies . sometimes it is just her first initial , sometime her nickname . . .
i just have not found it yet . i tried c . halbrook , connie halbrook , spunky halbrook . . .
spunky ?
college nickname .
you try martin ?
she did not take my name when we were married .
it is perfect the line is busy ?
yes . i can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the white house .
you can do that ?
because last time i saw him i punched him in the face .
you punched the president in the face ?
he was not the president then .
moishe , please , do not talk .
what was it , roswell ? you had the space ship , the bodies , everything locked up in a bunker , the what is it , area fifty one . that is it ! area fifty one . you knew and you did not do nothing !
i am making a mess .
this i can see .
we have gotta burn the rain forest , pops . dump toxic waste , pollute the air , rip up the ozone . maybe if we screw this planet up enough they will not want it anymore .
david , you are drunk .
what would i say ?
a cold ? of course .
i want you should know , i am very proud of you , son .
oh shit , we are late .
we will meet you there .
great .
just getting a feel for her .
looks like they are preparing the invasion .
i cannot shake her free .
it is not me . they are overriding the system .
you as well .
does not matter . game s over .
i do not hear no fat lady .
i had a feeling you would .
sir , what happens if they do become hostile ?
then god help us .
but mr . president . . .
and get those helicopters away from the ship . call them back immediately .
she should be shortly .
the helicopter never arrived at nellis and there s been no radio contact .
eta with target four minutes .
and there are scattered reports of sightings over miami , ft . worth , and memphis .
we are down to approximately fifteen percent , sir . if you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on , we are looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours .
we are being exterminated .
yes , sir .
better than we thought .
and our troops here ?
we have been collecting planes from all over but . . .
but what , general ?
pilots , sir . we do not have enough people to get them in the air .
then find them .
i am a pilot , will . this is where i belong .
roger , eagle one , our primary target has shifted course .
i think our secret is out . they are headed right for us .
roger .
that is not your call to make , mr . nimziki .
sir , i strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately .
this is crazy . we are loosing our first strike capabilities !
we are trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we are getting nowhere . atlantic command is working on a type of visual communication .
my god , the vice president and the joint chiefs . . .
mr . president , we must launch . a delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities !
it had been deemed classified .
christ , why did not you say anything about this when they first arrived ? you could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of american pilots !
how long would their shields be down ?
please , you are not buying into any of this nonsense , are you ? we do not have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign . not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate .
no sir . definitely not .
how do you know ?
well , er . . . it is slowing down .
it is doing what ?
it is . . . slowing down , sir .
he is doing a good job .
baby , you know how it is . i have to report to el toro right away .
you said you were on leave for the fourth .
they cancelled it . why are you acting like this ?
what ?
be careful .
look , after your shift tonight , why do not you grab dylan and come stay with me on base .
really ? you do not mind ?
naw . i will just tell my other girlfriends they cannot come over tonight .
yes , i am .
dick weed !
butt munch .
you know how i like to make a big entrance .
you know me . . .
i know , you like to make a big entrance .
sorry for what ?
i should have done this a long long time ago .
yeah , but what an entrance !
dick weed .
butt munch .
he is my angel .
was his father stationed here ?
he was not his father . i was kinda hoping he would want the job , though .
i am a dancer .
really ? ballet ?
no . exotic .
oh . sorry .
do not be . i am not . it is good money . side , he is worth it .
funny , it used to scare me when i thought about the future . guess it does not really matter anymore .
i thought you did not recognize me .
did not want to say anything . i voted for the other guy .
how to kiss ass .
i thought you said you were doing to break it off .
do not get premature on me , jimmy . we do not light up til the fat lady sings .
i hear you .
do not worry , big guy . i am sure she got out of here before it happened .
i did not even see them fire !
command , eagle one . switching to sidewinders . we are moving in .
we are already over mach !
so push it !
jimmy , stay with me .
it is all fuzzy .
you are gonna break it . just leave it alone . here , take your medicine .
just take it , dick head . alicia ! make sure he takes his medicine .
yeah . what would you think if we went there to live for a while ?
that would be cool !
i did not take it . i thought i did not need it anymore .
i am bringing home the bacon . earning my keep . and doing a fine job if i do say so myself .
it is the wrong field , you idiot ! lucas farm is on the other side of town .
you sure ?
damn it , he was doing you a favor . you know how hard it is to find someone who does not think you are completely crazy ? what are we supposed to do now ? huh ? where are we supposed to go now ?
just what the hell do you think you are doing ?
you are not going anywhere . you hear me ? i am still your father .
for once in your life think about that is best for troy . who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up ? who ?
we should leave too .
there s a group heading south , they said there s a hospital just a couple hours away . i think we should follow them .
just fell asleep . he is gonna be just fine . join me in a little celebration ?
we must maintain a working government in a time of crisis . . .
i want the vice president , secretary of defense , the whole cabinet and the joint chiefs taken to a secured location . i am staying here . i am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives .
but , mr . president . . .
so far these things have not become hostile . for the moment let s assume they will not . connie , let s issue statements advising people not to panic , to stay home and take cover .
we are leaving .
above american soil ?
if we do not strike soon , there may not be much of an america left to defend .
two words , mr . president . plausible deniability .
deploy .
the other bombers might have more luck . we should not just give up . . .
i said call them back .
yes .
well , i guess you would like to see the big tamale ? follow me .
people are dying out there . i do not think exciting is the word i would choose to describe it !
not all too dissimilar to us . breathes oxygen , comparable tolerances to heat , cold . . . probably why they are interested in our planet . hey , you wanna see them ?
these three died in the crash . their bodies are as frail as our own . you just have to get past their technology , which is , i am sorry to say , far more advanced .
air . . . water . . . your sun .
where do your people come from ? where is your home ?
here . . . now .
and before here ?
many worlds . . .
can we negotiate a truce ? is there room for co existance ? can there be peace between us ?
peace ? no peace .
what do you want us to do ?
die .
marcus brody , sir . and where is indy ?
oh , he is in austria . a slight detour .
you are on your own ?
oh , yes , of course . but where are we going ?
oh , this map will show you . it was drawn by , uh . . .
and i am his .
there is no museum in iskenderun .
papers , sir . got it here .
egyptian mail . morning edition . run !
did you say . . . ? uh , uh . . .
the dog ! ? you are named after the dog . . .
you have got it !
all your life .
all my life !
well done , indy . very well done , indeed . this will find a place of honor in our spanish collection .
yes . my treat .
i do not know . but whatever it is , he is in over his head !
it is today s mail . and it is been opened .
what is it ?
i do not know . but someone must want it pretty badly .
do you believe , marcus ?
the search for the cup of christ is the search for the divine in all of us .
call donovan , marcus . tell him i will take that ticket to venice now .
i will tell him we will take two .
yes . uh , how will we recognize this doctor schneider when we see him ?
i do not know . maybe he will know us .
it looks like a converted church .
where ?
dad was onto something here !
well , now we know the source of the numbers , but we still do not know what they mean .
it is better , now i have seen this . it is the name of a city . alexandretta ? hmmm . . .
your father would know . your father did know . look . he made a map .
alexandretta . now we know .
yes . now we know .
marcus , get hold of sallah . tell him to meet you in iskenderun .
i am going after dad .
it is . . . a leap of faith . oh , god .
arghhh ! oh !
it is a rescue , old boy . come on .
what ?
but do not you see ? the pen is mightier than the sword .
it is war .
no , henry . try not to talk .
the name of god . . .
got lost in his own museum , huh ?
do not worry . doctor schneider will be there to meet you .
schneider ?
i maintain an apartment in venice , at your disposal .
oh , well . that is good . thank you .
i would rather spit in your face . but as i have not got any spit . . .
you are meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend .
do not take that tone with me , my good man . now buttle off and tell baron brunwald that lord clarence macdonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries .
tapestries ?
dear me , the man is dense . this is a castle , is not it ? there are tapestries ?
this is a castle . and we have many tapestries . but if you are a scottish lord , then i am mickey mouse .
how dare he ? !
i know who you are mr . donovan . your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous . some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive .
well , like yourself , doctor jones , i have a passion for antiquities . have a look over here . this might interest you .
that was our assessment as well .
where did this come from ?
my engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of ankara while excavating for copper . can you translate the inscription ?
the holy grail , doctor jones . the chalice used by christ during the last supper . the cup that caught his blood at the crucifixion and was entrusted to joseph of arimathaea .
eternal life , doctor jones ! the gift of youth to whoever drinks from the grail . oh , now that is a bedtime story i would like to wake up to !
an old mangs dream .
every mangs dream . including your father s , i believe .
what good is it ? this grail tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons . pretty vague . where do you start looking ? maybe if the tablet were intact , you would have something to go on . but the entire top portion is missing .
just the same , an attempt to recover the grail is currently underway .
i have heard this one as well . two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the grail and began the long journey back to france . but only one of them made it . and before dying of extreme old age , he supposedly imparted his tale to a to a franciscan friar , i think .
not supposedly , doctor jones .
that is usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet .
you could be more right than you know .
yes ?
we have hit a snag . our project leader has vanished . along with all his research . uh , we received a cable from his colleague , doctor schneider , who has no idea of his whereabouts or that is become of him . i want you to pick up the trail where he left off . find the man and you will find the grail .
you have got the wrong jones , mister donovan . why do not you try my father ?
we already have . your father is the man who s disappeared .
did not i warn you not to trust anybody , doctor jones ?
as what ? a nazi stooge like you ?
nazis ? ! is that the limit of your vision ? ! the nazis want to write themselves into the grail legend and take on the world . well , they are welcome . but i want the grail itself . the cup that gives everlasting life . hitler can have the world , but he cannot take it with him . i am going to be drinking my own health when he is gone the way of the dodo . the grail is mine , and you are going to get it for me .
shooting me will not get you anywhere .
you know something , doctor jones ? you are absolutely right .
we are through !
yes ?
i knew it was you
looks like the best parts have already been spoken for .
who ? attila the professor ? he was never giddy , even when he was a schoolboy !
i usually do not .
i usually do not either .
in that case , i permit you .
but i am already sad by tomorrow it will have faded .
tomorrow i will steal you another .
find something ?
you do not disappoint , doctor jones . you are a great deal like your father .
except he is lost , and i am not .
lower me down .
right . six hundred years before the crusades .
the christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later .
are you sure ?
pretty sure .
look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork .
it is a rubbing dad made of the grail tablet .
he never would have made it past the rats ! he hates rats ! he is scared to death of them !
what ?
you said go between them !
i said do not go between them !
mine , too .
what were they looking for ?
the grail diary .
uh huh .
you had it ? you did not trust me !
oh , yes . give them a flower and they will follow you anywhere .
knock it off . you are not mad .
no ?
no . you like the way i do things .
it is lucky i do not do things the same way . you would still be standing at the venice pier .
i know the brunwalds are famous art collectors .
do not know . think of something .
how do you know ?
so it did .
where is it ? i want it .
my father did not want it incinerated .
yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the grail stands for who gives a damn what you think ?
you do .
all i have to do is scream .
i am like a bad penny . i always turn up .
it is ours , indy . yours and mine .
elsa , do not cross the seal . the knight warned us not to take the grail from here .
i can reach it . i can reach it . . .
out !
it is important !
then wait count to twenty .
no , dad . you listen to me
junior !
do not call me that , please .
but what are you doing here ?
i came to get you ! what do you think ?
and the head . you hit me , dad !
i will never forgive myself
do not worry i am fine .
thank god !
well , i am sorry about your head , though . but i thought you were one of them .
dad , they come in through the doors .
good point .
i got it and i used it . we found the entrance to the catacombs .
through the library ?
right .
i knew it . and the tomb of sir richard ?
he was actually there ? you saw him ?
well , what was left of him .
and his shield . . . the inscription on sir richard s shield . . . ?
alexandretta . it is a great moment in henry s life . he turns aside , lost to himself for a moment , then turns to indy with joy .
alexandretta . . . of course . . . on the pilgrim trail from the eastern empire . oh , junior . . .
no , dad . you did . forty years .
if only i could have been with you .
there were rats , dad .
rats ?
yeah , big ones . what do the nazis want with you dad ?
they want my diary .
yeah ?
well , uh . . .
you did ! !
look , can we discuss this later ?
i should have mailed it to the marx brothers .
will you take it easy !
take it easy ? ! why do you think i sent it home in the first place ? so it would not fall into their hands ! !
i came here to save you .
oh yeah ? and who s gonna come to save you , junior ? ?
do not worry . he will not .
umh ?
how did you she was a nazi ?
she talks in her sleep .
so did i .
let s try and get these ropes loose . we have got to get to marcus before the nazis do !
you said he had two days start . that he would blend in . disappear !
are you kidding ? i made that up ! you know marcus he got lost once in his own museum !
my lucky charm .
feels like a cigarette lighter .
try and burn through the ropes .
do not get sentimental now dad save it til we get out of here .
the floor s on fire ! see ? !
what ? ? ?
and the chair .
all right , move ! move ! rock your chair . do what i do .
what ?
dad !
what ?
dad !
head for the fireplace !
oh .
i am out , dad !
. . . the solution presents itself .
what about the boat ? we are not going on the boat ?
what ?
stop ! stop !
brody s this way .
my diary s in berlin .
you do not need the diary , dad . marcus has the map .
there is more in the diary than just the map .
all right dad tell me .
well , he who finds the grail must face the final challenge .
what final challenge ?
three devices of such lethal cunning .
booby traps ?
oh , yes . but i found the clues that will safely take us through , in the chronicles of st . anselm .
but what are they ? cannot you remember ?
i wrote them down in my diary so that i would not have to remember .
half the german army s on our tail and you want me to go to berlin ? into the liongs den ?
yes ! the only thing that matters is the grail .
what about marcus ?
marcus would agree with me .
two selfless martyrs . jesus christ !
this is an obsession dad . i never understood it . never . neither did mom .
oh yes , she did . only too well . unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all i could do was mourn her .
i do not know . the first available flight out of germany .
good .
relax .
that is not all we shared . it is disgraceful . you are old enough to be her fa . . . er , her grandfather !
well , i am as human as the next man .
i was the next man .
ships that pass in the night . . .
hmmm . . . what did we talk about ?
we did not talk . we never talked .
and do i detect a rebuke ?
a regret . it was just the two of us , dad . it was a lonely way to grow up . for you , too . if you had been an ordinary , average father like the other guys dads , you would have understood that .
actually , i was a wonderful father .
when ?
what you taught me was that i was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country . and i learned it so well that we have hardly spoken for twenty years .
you left just when you were becoming interesting .
dad , how can you ?
very well . i am here now .
then what are you complaining about ? look , we have work to do . when we get to alexandretta we will face three challenges . first , the breath of god . only the penitent man will pass . second , the word of god , only in the footsteps of god will he proceed . third , the path of god , only in the leap from the liongs head will he prove his worth .
what does that mean ?
i do not know . we will find out .
fly . . . yes . land . . . no .
what happens at eleven o clock ?
more or less . son , i am sorry . they got us .
thanks .
i know , dad !
it is a new experience for me .
it happens to me all the time .
this could be close .
dad , we are well out of range .
who cares ? as long as they are keeping donovan busy . dad , you stay here while sallah and i organize some transportation .
you call this archaeology ?
get out of there , dad !
junior . . .
the penitent man will pass . the penitent . . . the penitent . the penitent man . . .
the penitent man . the penitent . . .
penitent . penitent . . .
the penitent man is humble . . .
j .
i can get it i can almost reach it , dad .
what did you find , dad ?
me ? . . . illumination .
junior ? ! dad . . .
we named the dog indiana .
ready .
after you , junior .
yes , sir ! haaa !
who are you ?
the last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the grail and to guard it .
that was seven hundred years ago .
a long time to wait .
i am not exactly . . . a knight . what do you mean ?
i was chosen because i was the bravest and the most worthy . the honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat . i pass it to you who vanquished me .
what happened to marcus , sallah ?
ah , they set out across the desert this afternoon . i believe they took mister brody with them .
come on come on !
i will take the camels .
i do not need camels .
but , indy
no camels !
compensation for my brother in law s car . indy , your father and brody
where is my father ?
they have them . in the belly of that steel beast .
because you are looking for the holy grail .
my father was looking for the holy grail . did you kill him too ?
no .
where is he ? talk or you are dead . damn it , tell me ! tell me !
if you do not let go , doctor jones , we will both die .
then we will die .
my soul is prepared . how is yours ?
no , doctor jones . it is yours !
if you let me go , i will tell you where he is .
who are you ?
my name is kazim .
and why were you trying to kill me ?
the secret of the grail has been safe for a thousand years . and for all that time the brotherhood of the cruciform sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe .
i did not come for the cup of christ . i came to find my father .
in that case , god be with you in your quest . your father is being held in the castle of brunwald on the austrian german border .
just a routine inspection tour .
the british worry so about their empire it makes us feel like well cared for children .
of course . the thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped kali with human sacrifices . the british army wiped them out about the time of the mutiny of .
i am sure that will please the maharajah , captain .
as i said before , we would be happy to escort you to delhi .
no . but i am interested in the occult . and this is a kryta .
it is like the voodoo dolls of west africa . the kryta represents your enemy and gives you complete power over him .
thank god all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing .
you think so ?
of course . admittedly , it is taken time . britaings controlled india for almost two hundred years now .
this is a different situation , dr . jones . these people are like children . we have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century .
no , he is a very shrewd old boy . power behind the throne and all that . he actually runs this whole province .
something magical . a sacred rock .
even if they were trying to scare us away , a devout hindu would never touch meat . makes you wonder what these people are . . .
miss scott panicked ?
when she saw the insects she passed out cold . i carried her back to her room . she was sleeping when i re entered the tunnel to look around .
did you discover anything in that tunnel , dr . jones ?
finally !
no you cannot go ! something awful s happened . they have got short round and i think indy s been
what ?
we found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace ! please , come with me , i will show you !
it is some kind of cult ! and they have got the sacred stones that indy was searching for .
i remember first hearing your name when i was studying at oxford . i am chattar lal , prime minister for his highness the maharajah of pankot .
you should have been there . . .
no , no , that is uhmed singh , the present maharajah s late father .
oh good . and maybe the present maharajah is a little younger ? and thinner ?
dinner ? and with a prince ? ! my luck is changing . but look at me my god , i have to get ready !
his highness has not yet taken a wife .
no ? well , i guess he just has not met the right woman . . .
i am afraid they will kill them ! we saw horrible things down there they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a mangs heart out !
what are you talking about i am not a dope fiend ! i saw it ! i will show you !
lost ? no , we are not lost . we are on our way to delhi . this is miss scott and mr . round . my name s indiana jones .
dr . jones ? the eminent archaeologist ?
i am only his humble servant , but the maharajah usually listens to my advice .
a very fine collection of very old pieces , do not you think ?
yes , very fine . but not all of the pieces look old . some were carved recently and look like images used by the thuggees to worship the goddess kali .
there are no stories anymore .
well , i do not know . . . we came here from a small village and the peasants there told us that the pankot palace was growing powerful again because of some ancient evil .
maybe . . . but how do you explain the thuggee shrine i saw right below the palace ?
dr . jones , in our country a guest does not usually insult his host .
sorry , i thought we were just talking about folklore .
when they lost this rock their fields and animals died . they also said their children were taken from them .
i think that is enough of this nonsense , dr . jones . . .
dr . jones , we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors . i seem to remember that in honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist .
the newspapers exaggerated the incident .
and did not the sultan of madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country ?
that was a misunderstanding .
exactly what we have here , dr . jones .
yes , i understand .
kali ma protects us now and for ever , and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood !
lao she .
nee chin lie how ma ?
i do not like to show off .
sure , i found him . then last night i had a little trouble . somebody tried to slit my throat .
next time i will cut off more than his finger .
dr . jones i want nurhachi .
a bonus , dr . jones . that is poison . you just drank the rest of it .
at last i have the ashes of my sacred ancestor !
step on it , short round !
okey doke , indy ! hold onto your potatoes !
sure , indy three tickets ! you , me and wu han
okay , shorty .
it is just superstition , shorty . like a ghost story .
nope , you got a little surprise over there , shorty .
that is it . pankot palace .
just a statue .
you do not like him do you ?
next time i flatten him ! did you see his eyes ?
no .
indy , they glow like fire and get real crazy ! then he talk in this real scary voice !
yeah , that is what happened . . .
okay , shorty . . . see you in the morning . . . i am going to have a little word with willie .
follow in the footsteps of shiva . do not betray his truth .
why they glow like that ?
legend says that when the stones are brought together the diamonds inside of them will glow .
why ?
behind you !
read you loud and clear , indy !
what ?
nobody s perfect . the way i heard it , you stole one of them from a small village .
two are still missing .
no . they are here somewhere . a century ago when the british raided this temple and butchered my people , a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs .
that is what you have got these children these slaves digging for ?
they dig for the gems to support our cause . they also search for the last two stones . soon we will have all five sankara stones and the thuggees will be all powerful !
nobody can say you do not have a vivid imagination .
you do not believe me ? you will , dr . jones . you will become a true believer .
you are in no position to give orders , dr . jones .
mola ram you are about to meet kali in hell !
you are betrayed shiva .
pankot is not on the way to delhi .
you will go to palace there .
has not the pankot palace been deserted since the mutiny of ?
no . now there is new maharajah and palace is powerful again .
i do not understand . that is happened here ?
the evil starts in pankot . then like monsoon , it moves darkness over all country .
what evil ?
they came from palace and took sivalinga from out village .
nobody brought us here . our plane crashed . we were shot down by
no . we pray to krishna to help us find the stone . it was krishna who made you fall from sky so you can got to pankot palace . to find sivalinga and bring back to us .
long ago before my father s father .
and it had three lines painted across it ? the lines represent the three levels of the universe . i have seen stones like the one you lost .
they say we must pray to their evil god . we say we will not .
i am sorry , i do not know how i can help you here .
hey , he is not a waiter . . .
no , wu hangs an old friend i brought along . so , the game s not over . put the antidote on the table , lao .
who cares ? where is that diamond !
relax , i have been giving him lessons .
do not get your hopes up where is the antidote ?
poison never agrees with me . pull a right , short round , and head for the wang poo bridge !
the airport . . . no , look out , short round ! left , left !
siam .
siam ? but i am not dressed for siam . . .
since i was nice enough to let you tag along , why do not you give your mouth a rest ? okay , doll ?
oh yeah ?
get over here , damn it ! short round , come on , grab onto me tight !
no . . . i am not cut out for the kind of life you lead . oh no . . . i ripped my dress . where are we anyway ?
holy cow india ? how do you know we are in
he told me they knew i was coming here .
what do you mean how ?
the old man saw it in a dream .
dream nightmare is more like it .
he said that is whey they were at river they were waiting for the plane to fall down .
that is more food than these people eat in a week . they are starving , too . . .
it is a sacred stone in a shine that is supposed to protect a village .
their children ?
it was destined that i came here and the future cannot be changed . . .
stark naked ? you wish . . . if you are trying to seduce me , dr . jones , this is a very primitive approach .
me seduce you ? honey , you are the one who took your clothes off . i just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water .
somehow i feel safer in here .
do not worry , i am coming in ! what is it ?
a snake !
a snake ! !
uh , listen willie i got a better idea .
what ? !
first of all do not panic !
it is pulling me deeper !
do not let it curl around you !
it is curling around me ! damn it , stop talking and do something !
what ? !
can you move your arm ?
just one arm !
okay , i want you to lift your hand and pet the snake .
pet it ? ? ! !
yes , stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae .
the what ? !
pet it on the head ! go on , pet it !
keep stroking it !
it is starting to let go !
that is good you are doing fine .
i know the feeling . . .
i met short round when he tried to pick my pocket .
he will be okay . he is a good kid .
well , when my nightclub career was run over by the depression , some pinhead convinced me that a girl could go places in the orient . . . so , look where i got .
oh , that is easy i am going to latch onto a good looking , incredibly rich prince .
oh really ?
yeah , but he is got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years . fortune and glory . . .
is that what you are hoping to find at this palace , dr . jones ?
maybe . . .
what does the writing say ?
it is sanskrit . it tells the story of sankara climbing mt . kalisa where he met the hindu god shiva .
that is shiva ? that is he giving the priest ?
legend says he told sankara to go forth and combat evil . to do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers .
you mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village ?
i would be safer sleeping with that snake .
just try and control yourself .
he said he could not take us any farther . he has to go sell the elephants .
you mean we have to walk the rest of the way ?
yeah , i wish you would thought of this sooner . . .
she might get away with that act here , but she would never make it in a real nightclub .
maybe he likes older women .
i have never been so hungry in my life . . .
no real food .
wearing your jewels to bed , princess ?
i am a scientist . i like doing research on certain nocturnal activities
you are talking to an authority in that area .
you want me so bad , why do not you invite me ?
too proud to admit you are crazy about me , dr . jones ?
i think you are too used to getting you own way , willie . . .
do not catch cold .
dr . jones ?
you are dreaming , willie . you want to make it real , just knock on my door .
what the bug ?
gee , i would not want to touch an ugly critter like that !
you know , willie , i will bet he is mad because they were eating his friends for dinner .
please oh please , i am going to die ! get it off !
willie , come here ! hurry up , we are in trouble ! !
i am coming , that is the rush ? ! ohh ! that is that ? ! there s stuff all over the floor ! i cannot see a thing !
willie , open the door ! get us out of here !
a what ? !
i cannot find any lever ! help me indy !
that is it the release lever look inside !
i am it looks horrible !
willie !
it is a thuggee ceremony . they are worshipping kali , the goddess of death and destruction .
no . . . the heart s still beating !

i am going down .
down ? down there ? ! are you crazy !
i am not leaving without those stones .
you are gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory !
maybe . . . someday . not today .
they think i am insane . tell them i am not , indy . please help me . . .
you have got to go to sleep now .
i want to go home . . .
i do not blame you . . . this has not been what you would call a fun vacation . . .
yes .
so now they believe me .
yes , they believe you .
no . . . they will not kill me .
you know you have been nothing but trouble since i hooked up with you but i have to admit i would miss you if i lost you . . .
there s got to be another way out .
go !
what above the curves ? !
yeah this time you are gonna help !
not quite .
and they do not even know what it really is .
well , you did not get your prince , and there goes your diamond .
you did not do so well yourself . finding that stone could have gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about .
it is still a long way to delhi . who knows what might happen .
you got it !
they do not cry about you . they cry about the elephants leaving .
figures . . .
they got no food to feed them . so they taking the elephants away to sell them .

yeah . some help . that poetry really killed her .
it worked .
i made it work .
you stumbled around . remember , you have got my id , you have got to be me , not some stumblebum .
rene . . .
i am not some hot shot test pilot . i am not some playboy . i do not usually pick up girls .
well you did it today .

what are you looking at ?
that is nothing look like ? . . . it looks like nothing .
is something glinting ?
looks like . . . the optic nerve . i can see out !
this . . . is not going to work out .
not blue enough .
it is my business . it is my name .
but the rest is me . i will dress like i want .

pan the group , will you . if you are right , at least one of them . . . is involved .
that is a big if .
what glasses .
the drinks . . . stay on them .
are you serious ?
just hold them close and stay still .
the blond . . . gruner . a killer .
killer !
i do not know that is going on .
it lends you an air of mystery .
my coast is maine , actually . we have a place in bar harbor . . . and a bar in sutton place .
do not get too cute .
. . . i have lost something . i must get it back .
how do you know ?
voice stress analyzer .
your data must be bad . everyone cannot be lying all the time .
she is the toughest to read .
maybe she is telling the truth .
cannot tell . every time i try her , you look away . or you make noises . maybe you do not want to know .
come on . . . look at her . do not you know anything about women ? . . . the data is skewed . we might as well go with instinct . . .
this just will not work .
you are doing great with her .
not her . you !
what is it ?
you cannot listen . you cannot watch either .
what if she says something important ?
i will be right here . i will keep it in mind . i will get a lot more from her without you butting in .
what am i supposed to do ?
you got any books in there ?
oh come on .
you shut down your sensors .
joe ! it is hours !
i mean it . you watch old tapes of the ballgame , i will fill you in . . . later . i mean it .
i do not know !
what she say . what would you get out of her ?
is that all ?
oh , you were right . they have all been here before . . . met just last week .
shit ! you are in love .
it is not your time . i get time off .
you get time off to sleep .
no . what will you do .
i . . . i will got to the movies . that is what i will do !
it was not like that .
why do not you get out of my face .
you found her .
better . i found ryuji .
that is good . it is not better . where ?
osaka .
osaka ?
fountainhead of high tech .
we are trying to stand out . right near his address . easier to get them to come to us , than to try and find them . . . now keep your eyes open , something might present itself .
i am running in circles in the middle of some foreign country . i do not speak their language , they do not speak mine . i do not even know where i am . that is going to present itse . . . . . . . .
follow her .
on what ?
run , stupid !
i cannot keep up .
that is not funny .
just stay here and rest .
where are you going ?
down to your heart . i am gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me .
wait a minute . wait a minute . al , you leave my heart alone . . .
what do i do ?
relax . let me do this .
it is a blank . this is no time for zen .
you think . that is what you are good at .
i told you , i have a feeling . . .
one of your instincts ?
i know she is not with them . i know something else . that is bothering you is not her .
do not worry !
too late .
drink lots of water .
you have to ! quickly !
. . . imagine a better grape for the region .
trying to analyze this stuff . now . . . go to the medicine shelf and take and .
a hard left . a hard left .
i cannot see a thing .
neither can they .
never mind , just say it .

you were with gruner !
no . you cannot trust her .
probably .
i do not trust her .
then why let her out of our sight ? besides , she is all we have got . . .
come on .
i have got an idea .
i was afraid of that .
not sure at all .
well at least talk it up , then . i feel like an idiot .
just say the words . just like i told you .
you said , yen for the right sony walkman .
haka xuki . that is that mean ?
cash .
well . . . ?
it is not the one . . . wait . . . there s a label .
while he makes the run .
where ?
and dieter ?
he must not know . gruner just made the switch back .
he did not . he left us that walkman chip to confuse us . would have kept most people busy . we were too fast for him .
i cannot handle that thing .
do not worry , i can .
just fine . i will do the driving from now on .
aim what ?
. . . shit ! it is just money .
the man we want has the pem , and is across the border by now .
dieter !
gruner switched the chip to him , not from him , then he led us away again . . . to chiang cho .
and do not let her know , either .
well , do not let it . what are you doing ?
ought to be , they stole everything and reverse engineered it . looks like all they need is the chip .
what exactly ?
i do not know .
losing power . the laser drained it .
where have you been ?
never mind that , where are we now .
we are in a dungeon . how do we get out ?
gimme a minute .
looks like you can have all you want .
keep thinking .
i have been . . . i think you are right .
about what ?
dieter asked where i was . he expected me here . maybe someone was assigned to bring me here .
rene ?
she works for them .
now , you are too suspicious .
you were the one who was always suspicious of her !
i was wrong . she tried to help us get away .
no . she just stayed with us . like she did all along .
you have changed your mind .
thing is . . . i think i am in love with her .
oh no !
she is in love with you . anyone can see that .
they can ?
yeah , sure .
you are lovely .
i want you to know how much i appreciate what you have done .
i want to thank you for what you have done .
i mean it ! no one else would have helped . i take it all back , everything i have said about you .
i will get us out of here .
do not worry about me . you take this time for your own , you two . . . . .
that is nice .
sending what we know back to u . s . t . via satellite .
go toe . it is some islands .
joe what does some island have to do with this ? it is a mistake ?
it is all we have got .
face it , we are the men for the job . besides , if someone is really chasing you , the best way to avoid them is to keep moving . . . and find the goddamn pem .
joe it is not love . it is like . it is real strong like . and i got your information . now , get off my back !
some friend you are ! you know what i hope ?
ryuji bandaio . grown near here .
are not we all .
it will remind me of you .
works like a charm when i use it . you did not say it right .
what part what ?
the best part . she will love it .
do what ? what would you do ?
do not give her your name .
oh , i cannot .
good .
dieter ?
i insist .
do not worry .
look , i do not know how we are gonna get out of this .
i know we fight , but i do not mean it . you are quite a guy . no one else could have dealt with this .
in my own way . . . i want you to know that . . . i love you .
let us get to the border !
then what ?
trouble . . . is , if we both get stuck here .
joe s escaped . dieter s in him .
in him ?
it is a long story .
ya hyutn slulptsa ?
what a nerve !
rene ?
she found out what she could . . . and delivered him here .
i will prove it . we will repeat their procedures . . . put a man in our pod , bring it down , and then . . . inject him .
who s our little man ?
me .
no . if anything happened , you would be stuck in there like he was .
i take the last chip in with me . i use it , to control re enlargement , from inside .
then how did you know ?
i dyed it . we are all getting old .
? ! !
newer , more powerful design .
we will let you go . you leave the pods and the pem .
they took the tapes .
you have nothing . . .
we do not even know where to start . what about these people ? what do we do with them ?
surveilliance on them all .

ah . . . no sir . he was here for a job interview .
does not matter . then put him away .
sir ?
private clinic . best of care . total privacy . we will pay all costs .

that crazy guy ?
yes . joe .
it is just money .
hey , sit in the car . i will get you a fee . make up for what you lost on the tour .

it is to me too .
you remind me of someone . you from the west coast ?

i waited for you .
why ?
. . . i . . . do not know .
it is not apparent .
. . . and sort of . . . disinterest .
disinterest ?
as if your mind s not all there .
i am sort of scattered .
can i help ?
you are .
are you alright ?
that you are not crazy .
i promise you that . i am not crazy . course , if i was , i would be the last to know . why do you ask ?
you talk to yourself .
but i do not listen . . . then i would be crazy .
why do you do it ?
if i was with you , i would not
you did .
that was then . this is now . who am i talking to ?
you are talking to me .
and how m i doing ?
you are doing . . . okay .
just okay . . .
. . . naw . made that up .
who do you work for ?
no one . no one at all . i am unemployed . who do you ?
trans ocean travel .
is that ryuji ?
no . ryuji just hires us .
hires you for what ?
to organize things . meetings and travel . . . whenever they come here , i handle details .
how often they come here ?
he likes the quiet . they were here last week .
and you , what do you like ?
that depends . . .
why would you run off ?
they left . i had to go with them .
why did not you tell me ?
wanted to get to know you .
why ?
you seemed interesting .
who else is interested in me ?
what do you mean ?
your friends , did they ask about me ?
they kidded me a little .
what did you tell them ?
there s not much to tell .
why did they leave ?
i do not know , ryuji said there was a change of plans .
you work for ryuji ?
sometimes . i told you i did .
were you working for him last night ?
last night ?
did he put you up to it ? did he ask you to sleep with me ?
no , he did not do that .
he did not .
no .
who did ?
you did .
this is a tough place to keep kosher .
food does not agree with me .
i am leaving too .
why ?
this business is over .
i am sorry . what will you do ?
go back to tokyo . try to get another tour . . . . you are following gruner ?
i am just on vacation .
now , so am i . . . that is so interesting about him ?
that is he done ?
he stole something . from a friend of mine .
he must be a good friend .
we are very close .
what would he steal ?
a chip . goes in a computer .
one chip ?
the most important one . can you help me find him ?
how do you know you can trust me ?
got to trust someone .
what is it ?
hiroshima .
get your things .
oh sure .
then why are you smiling like that ?
lots of my clients are rich guys . . . they like danger . . like playing with drugs and things . . . running around , acting mysterious .
you think i am like that ?
they would never talk in front of me . they would walk away up the beach . nervous about something .
who was ?
ryuji and gruner .
and dieter .
friend of gruner . just went along for the party .
and you ?
it was a good job . not many ways for a foreigner to make money here . ryuji hires me to organize business meetings . . . take care of things .
beats me .
must be a pick up , a rendezvous .
then where is the chip .
he plays it all the time .
we figure out if it is in here .
how ?
why do not you get us some food . this may take some time .
get us one .
too late , they will not come back out till morning .
where would you go to sell a chip ?
hong kong .
what ?
dieter s gone to shoot a still job . hong kong .
i asked him .
oh .
he is a client of mine ! that is the matter . you cannot suspect dieter . he is a famous photographer . he makes millions .
maybe i am wrong . then gruner will not be here .
i said just relax . i am in full control .
. . . across the border . come on !
that is not this direction . it is back the other way .
you have been there ?
i know the territory .
you coming along ?
this going to work ?
maybe they are expecting gruner . i am gonna be him .
he is dutch . you cannot even speak dutch .
can you ?
sure i can , cannot i ?
i cannot fly it .
what would . . . you forget ?
yes . no . i am . . . okay . they cannot do this . they cannot hold us here .
looks like they can . what did they do ?
they asked about you .
what did you tell them ?
that i really do not know .
now what ?
they will listen to what we say in here .
why ?
you can say that again . what do we do ?
nothing we can do .
they can hold us here forever . nobody knows about us .
cannot you do something ?
it was my choice .
why did you , then ?
for you .
i was . . . crazy . . . desperate . i took it out on you . i did not mean it . i know what she sees in you . you are kind and you are brave . if i ever get out of you , i will be glad to call you my friend .
what ?
i have never met anyone like you .
i love you too .
why not , what are you going to do ?
escape .
i will come back for you .
are not you a little optimistic ?
you are gonna laugh .
her ?
does not matter . i am on your side .
i knew it . i told him .
now what ?
we just do not stop .
do something !
do what ? i do not know . i am no good at this .
you are , i have seen you .
it was not me . it was him .
it was you .
he told me what to do .
but you did it . it was you .
if he was able , what would he say .
that is twenty feet high .
like al says . . . under stress , the human body is capable of impossible feats .
i told you , i work for him .
we are not moving fast enough for him .
he should do it in person . . . i mean ex person .
yeah . . . i have to get away .
i know a nice island .
it keeps me busy . everybody always wants something .
. . . piece of mind .
could have been drunk a little sooner , but excellent . . . good character . . . what is it ?
why are you on to him ?
we have had thefts of our new stuff . . . gruner deals in this . . . a big deal is going down now . i went to see if gruner had anything to sell . but he did not make any moves . . . and when you arrived , he backed off .
why would you invite me here ?
someone is selling . you followed us . if it is not him , it must be you . if it is not you , it must be him . . . you scared him off .
what about the others .
i do not know .
i am sorry . we are running behind . so many applicants . . . so few jobs . . . if you will just have a seat .
i have a seat . i have had it since nine .
. . . mr . athol will be with you as soon as possible . will you be able to wait ?
a drink . . .
water fountaings through that door , down the hall .
thanks .
why ?
you cannot take that .
why not ?
the experiment . the danger . . .
it is ?
it will be fine . you have another .
just one . the back up .
could i have it , please .
i cannot get it out . it would take hours .
that is alright . just tear it apart .
tear it apart ?

thank you .
yes .
the other working .

whoever took it does .
so we better get started .
what about al . . .
hi , daddy .
that is new ?
ms . laufer gave me a star today .
yeah ? what for ?
for reading .
okay .
she was playing with my pooh doll again . . .
she was playing with the pooh doll .
pooh s dusty , sweetheart . . . he is dusty , and you breathed him in , okay ? so that is that is happening to you now is . . . cells called mast cells told your lungs do not breathe any more of that dust in . . . . and the airways in your lungs are like branches . and when the branches close up , you get an asthmatic attack . and , we give you medicine , and you get better . huh ? okay ? you are better already , are not you ?
instant rice . . . ?
can i go over to janeane s house ?
that is that outside , daddy ?
did you see somebody or did you hear them ?
i heard them .
where ?
in the backyard .
that remote control thing ?
yeah .
alright , we will do that tomorrow .
mom .
yes , baby ?
there s dad , on tv .
you better take a good look ! because i am getting two things pissed off and curious ! now , any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire ? either one of those guys have ex agent pals already in those jobs ? like , for instance , their ex supervisor , who s already at brown williamson as we fucking speak ?
lowell ?
how long ?
three hours .
you got a deal .
you bet we are . and i cannot talk to you now .
we gotta hook up .

p . j . s .
i will be there .
monday .
push it .
what ? forget it .
it is a smear campaign , charlie .
it is drawn from a selectively circulated . . .
oh , it is real selective . . . about as hard to get a hold of as the manhattan phone book .
well , it is authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented .
and it is bullshit . and if i am right , are you going to put the journal s reputation behind a story that is going to blow up in your face ?
i will take a look at what you got . but i am not moving any deadlines cause you say so .
yeah . catch you later .
suein hwang and milo geyelin .
have them make their own calls . they will find that these sources have a different story than the one that is in the dossier . . . push the deadline , charlie . . .
okay .
what do you mean , that is it do ?
what i mean is , like , how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement ?
because he has to reveal it in a court of law . it is on record , it is out . it is no secret anymore . so how can they restrain his speech or retaliate ? it is out in the world . . .
oh , we need cops on the street . we do not need them on horses .
i do not know what he was thinking .
oh , for god s sake , what has this guy got , a horse fetish ?
alright , alright .

. . . fuck is this ? fuck !
okay . hold on a second . . . what is it ?
good .
the sub heading is , brown williamson has a page dossier attacking chief critic . it quotes richard scruggs calling it the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistle blower .
. . . if you are , then i will take barbara to soccer and take you to dance after . . .
maybe later .
how about you ?
i am cooking pasta primavera .
oh , i love that stuff .
yeah , they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of kools to the world . sealed does not hurt scruggs litigation , and since we are the only ones with the story , i believe we are sitting on an exclusive .
lunch ?
it is an alternate version . so what if we have an alternate version ? and i do not think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable .
it is not a rumor . it is a sale . if tisch can unload cbs for a share to westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion dollar lawsuit from brown williamson , that could screw up the sale , could it not ?
oh , no , of course they are not influenced by money . they work for free . and you are a volunteer executive producer .
cbs does not do that . and , you are questioning our journalistic integrity ? !
no , i am questioning your hearing ! you hear reasonable and tortious interference . i hear . . . potential brown williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of cbs to westinghouse . i hear . . . shut the segment down . cut wigand loose . obey orders . and fuck off . . . ! that is what i hear .
you are exaggerating !
i am ? you pay me to go get guys like wigand , to draw him out . to get him to trust us , to get him to go on television . i do . i deliver him . he sits . he talks . he violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement . and he is only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue , maybe the biggest , most expensive corporate malfeasance case in u . s . history . and jeffrey wigand , who s out on a limb , does he go on television and tell the truth ? yes . is it newsworthy ? yes . are we gonna air it ? of course not . why ? because he is not telling the truth ? no . because he is telling the truth . that is why we are not going to air it . and the more truth he tells , the worse it gets !
you are a fanatic . an anarchist . you know that ? if we cannot have a whole show , then i want half a show rather than no show . but oh , no , not you . you will not be satisfied unless you are putting the company at risk !
c mon , what are you ? and are you a businessman ? or are you a newsman ? ! because that happens to be what mike and i do for a living . . .
well , what do you think i am going to do ? quit in protest ? i am not going to do that .
you are taking no for an answer ?
no . i am not going to take no for an answer . no .
then what are you going to do ?
end up in a high profile lawsuit with lowell , the first amendment martyr ? i do not think so . take a look at this . . . this is a summary of a dossier that is being prepared .
what does it look like i am doing ? i am editing .
no , not that . i am talking about the associated press . they got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to mike and i . did you tell them that we were lying ?
no . i should have . i told them i disagreed with you , mike and kluster that this segment is as good as the original . i am not lying for you . i am not gonna shut up for you . not on any of it .
hey ! i am not going to fire you , okay ? take a vacation . now !
no , you fucked you ! do not invert stuff ! big tobacco tried to smear wigand you bought it . the wall street journal , here , not exactly a bastion of anti capitalist sentiment , refutes big tobacco s smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination ! and now , even now , when every word of what wigand has said on our show is printed , the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the state of mississippi , the cat totally out of the bag , you are still standing here debating ! don , what the hell else . . . do you need ?
so , what happened to ms . caperelli s checking with outside counsel first , all that crap ?
that is happening . and , hopefully we will not have to use the alternate , but we should have it in the can .
i am not touching my film . . .
i am afraid you are .
no , i am not . . .
we are doing this with or without you , lowell . if you like , i can assign another producer to edit your show . . .
before you go . . .
i am not implying . i am quoting . more vested interests . . . persons who will profit from this merger . . . ms . helen caperelli , general counsel of cbs news , . million . mr . eric kluster , president of cbs news , . million . . .
yes , i am afraid i did .
what caliber is your gun ?
what caliber is my gun ?
yes , sir . what caliber is your gun ?
what does that have to do with the price of tea in china ?
if we could take a look , mr . wigand . . .
yes , i do . a . target master . in my gun safe downstairs . a . gold cup . a . target pistol . so what ?
do you have a history of emotional problems , mr . wigand ?
yes . yes , i do . yes , i get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox . . . !
we have a search warrant , mr . wigand . there s been a death threat .
. . . my files ! personal correspondence . . .
you alright , mr . wigand ?
hey , lowell .
what about you , you got a crew already ?
i am gonna do a follow up .
okay .
catch ya later .
no , no , we are fine . . .
are you sure ?
how grave ?
well , at the end of the day . . . because of your segment . . . the brown williamson tobacco company . . . could own cbs .
mike ?
i am told unusual promises were made to wigand .
no , only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him . . .
and , i am told there are questions as to our star witness veracity .
his veracity was good enough for the state of mississippi .
our standards have to be higher than anyone else s , because we are the standard . . . for everyone else . . .
well , with tortious interference , i am afraid . . . the greater the truth , the greater the damage .
come again ?
they own the information he is disclosing . the truer it is , the greater the damage to them . if he lied , he did not disclose their information . and the damages are smaller .
is this alice in wonderland ?
you are getting ahead of yourself . we are all in this together . we are all cbs . we will find out soon . thank you , gentlemen .
how are you , jim ?
hey , listen , i hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there .
catch you later .
oh , c mon , lowell . this is the new york times . i do not know . . .
well , until you do , all i can tell you is what you already know . . . they will not air an interview .
call me back in ten .
jim , it is lowell .
okay . lowell ?
yeah ?
you are sure you want to do this ?
why ?
hey , it does not work ? you have burned your bridges , man .
you ready . . . ?
okay . . . about this whistle blower . . . did mike and don go along with the corporate decision ?
did i tell you you were wrong ?
no . i am assuming the cave in begins with the threat of litigation from big tobacco . are we talking . . . are we talking brown williamson , here ?
do not you have to be at the office ?
is there any more rice . . . ?
yes , it is on the stove . . .

i did not want to leave it there . . .
i do not understand .
i got fired this morning . . . where else am i gonna take it ?

thomas sandefur . . .
what are we supposed to do . . . ? what about our medical coverage what about our health ? what about our car payments ? the payments on this house ?

i told him that you had an e mail death threat that said if you did not shut the f up , they were going to kill you . . .
i am doing an interview .
an interview ! do you know what they will do to us . . . ! i thought . . . sorry .
where should i wash them ?

. . . ignition propensity ? . . . you understand any of this . . . ?
. . . it is anonymous . references to p . m . it is got to be philip morris , huh ?
i have to take a shower .
they are killing the wigand interview . . .
what ? !
they are pretending it is process . bullshit , it is foregone .
what are you and mike going to do ?
i am alone on this . . .
oh , baby . . .
jeffrey . . .
so , it is a big country with a free press . you can go work somewhere else .
free press ? press is free . . . for anyone who owns one . larry tisch has a free press .
get some perspective , lowell .
i got perspective .
no , you do not .
from my perspective , that is been going on and what i have been doing is ridiculous . it is half measures .
you are not listening . really know what you are going to do before you do it .
. . . you fucked me !
who is this ?
no . no , it is okay . . . how is how is the new place ?
you are not even on this anymore . . . what do you care ?
jeff ! wake the fuck up ! everybody is on the line here . if they can catch you in a lie , they can paint everything with that brush . do you understand ? everything you say !
alright .
area code .
i will call you then .
that is right . . .
well , i am working with someone , now , who was the former head of research at brown williamson , a former corporate officer there .
that is your interest in this , mr . bergman ?
well , he may tape an interview with us . and , we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first , it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection .
well , actually , no . well , he is on the fence . that is the point .
well , would you want him to call you ? or , you want to call him ? how do you want to do it ?
it would be better if he called us .
yeah .
alright ?
okay . thank you .
what chance is there of getting jeff s interview on the air . . . ?
. . . and i would be lying to you if i did not tell you , i am about out of moves , dick . . .
all right . see you . . .
good , well ask him if arabic is his second language .
do not interpret that ! hold it . hold it . hold it ! slow , slow ! ! sheikh , do you mind . . . if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face mr . wallace ?
you eating with us ?
yeah .
bring a tie so they will let us in the front door . . .
what seven dwarfs ?
the seven ceos of big tobacco . . . referred to this . . . said they should be afraid of him . . . i assume , afraid of what he could reveal . now , you tell me . what does this guy have to say that threatens these people ?
hardly new news .
no shit .
that is this ?
what do you mean ?
we got a guy . . . who wants to talk but he is constrained . what if he were compelled ?
oh , torture ? great ratings .
how are the rooms ? comfortable ?
do you think we could talk about the taping ? tomorrow s taping , just so we can get it out of the way and order . . .
yeah , well , questions will go toward what work you did there , why you were fired . and others will deal . . .
who are these people ?
ordinary people ! under extraordinary pressure , mike . what the hell do you expect ? grace and consistency ?
good .
after we corroborate it . that is why we have never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show . anything else ?
what ?
put the corporation at risk . . . ? give me a fucking break !
lowell .
these people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do . . . on the line !
lowell !
what ?
i am with don on this .
i took off on tisch . i took off on corporate . they will know they are not going to see everything on sunday night . . .
i do not know . how does that get wigand on the air ?
do me a favor , will you ? spare me , for god s sake . get in the real world . what do you think ? i am going to resign in protest ? to force it on the air ? the answer is no . i do not plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of national public radio . that decision i have already made .
you disappeared on me . how long you staying ?
i disappeared on you ?
alright . what did you think ?
i think it was a disgrace .
no , i usually sit around in my hotel room , dressed like this at in the morning , sleepy look on my face .
oh , lots .
yeah , that is right .
but in all that time , mike , did you ever get off a plane , walk into a room , and find that a source for a story changed his mind ? lost his heart ? walked out on us ? not one fucking time ! you want to know why ?
i see a rhetorical question on the horizon .
i am going to tell you why . because when i tell someone i am going to do something , i deliver .
oh , how fortunate i am to have lowell bergmangs moral tutelage to point me down the shining path . to show me the way .
oh , please , mike . . .
give me a break !
no , you give me a break ! i never left a source hung out to dry , ever . abandoned . not til right fucking now ! when i came on this job , i came with my word intact . i am gonna leave with my word intact . fuck the rules of the game ! hell , you are supposed to know me , mike . what the hell did you expect ? you expect me to lie down ? back off ? what , get over it ?
in the real world , when you get to where i am , there are other considerations . . .
like what ? corporate responsibility ? what , are we talking celebrity here ?
i am not talking celebrity , vanity , cbs . i am talking about when you are nearer the end of your life than the beginning . now , what do you think you think about then ? the future ? in the future i am going to do this ? become that ? what future ? no . what you think is how will i be regarded in the end ? after i am gone .
you and i have been doing this together for fourteen years .
everything interests me .
i did ? what do i tell a source on the next tough story ? hang in with us . you will be fine . . . maybe ?
yeah . . . thank you .
how have you liked your stay ?
what i have seen . . . i have liked .
because i think hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now . so you care about what you are thought of in america . and in america , at this moment in time , hezbollah does not have a face . that is why .
no . we do not do that . you have seen minutes and mike wallace . so you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity . you also know we are the highest rated , most respected , tv magazine news show in america .
that is good . that works . uh , you know , i want to ask you something . . . i know it sounds odd . . . but . . .
that is room service . they usually knock first . come on in . . . over here , please .
black , black . . .
is there anything you want to know about me , mr . wigand . . . ?
like what ? your sign ?
just so i know you know , when i talk to people in confidence , it stays that way .
how did a radical journalist from ramparts magazine end up at cbs ?
far as you go where ?
this issue is a drop in the bucket . i can talk to you about that is in here . but i cannot talk to you about anything else .
between journalists and management , yes , i believe they do . . . but i do not take that seriously . where do you work ?
did work .
did work .
how much would i get paid ?
that , you have to discuss with cbs business affairs . but , for something like this , i would say anywhere between , thousand .
if you want to do it .
what are you talking about ? where are you ?
fuck you , too !
jump in , quick , c mon . . .
i am lowell bergman . we spoke on the phone , remember ?
good . i want to talk to you .
i did not burn you . i did not give you up to anyone !
this is my house . . . in front of my wife , my kids ? ! what business do we have ?
to straighten something out with you . right here . right now .
so , you did not mention my name ? you have not talked to anybody about me ?
why am i gonna mention your name ?
how did brown williamson know i spoke to you . . . ?
how the hell do i know about brown williamson ?
it happened after i talked to you . i do not like coincidences !
and i do not like paranoid accusations ! i am a journalist . think . use your head . how do i operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it ?
you came all the way down here to tell me that ?
no . i did not . big tobacco is a big story . and you got something important to say . i can tell . but , yes . i did . i came all the way down here to tell you story , no story , fuck your story , i do not burn people .
they are afraid of you , are not they ?
they should be .
like what ?
like where would you work before brown williamson ?
johnson johnson . union carbide in japan . i was general manager and director of new products . i speak japanese . i was a director of corporate development at pfizer . all health related . what else ? outside the zone . . . ?
i do not know . . . you think the knicks are gonna make it through the semi finals ?
the seven ceos of big tobacco . . . they got up in front of congress that time . . . it was on television . . .
. . . and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction , disease . . .
it was on c span . yeah .
okay , so , here you are . . . you go to work for tobacco . you come from corporate cultures where research , really , creative thinking , these are core values . you go to tobacco . . . tobacco is a sales culture . market and sell enormous volume . go to a lot of golf tournaments . the hell with everything else . what are you doing ? why are you working for tobacco in the first place ?
i cannot talk about it . the work i was supposed to do . . . might have had some positive effect . i do not know . . . it could have been beneficial . mostly , i got paid a lot . i took the money . my wife was happy . my kids had good medical . good schools . got a great house . i mean , what the hell is wrong with that . . . ?
then . . . you are in a state of conflict , jeff .
you okay ?
good . you have kids ?
oh , yes , yes , yes , i did . . . i wanted to talk to you . i wanted to hook up and talk to you . about what we were talking about in your car .
. . . okay .
makes you feel good ? putting what you know to use ?
it is obvious , is not it ?
yeah . . . look , thanks for talking . i am sorry i woke you up .
it is okay .
tempura . . .
marcuse . yeah . he was my mentor . he had a major influence on the new left in the late s . . . and on me , personally .
next to your father ?
my father ? what the hell s that got to do with my father ?
is that why you became a journalist ? then you get to ask all the questions ?
you charge by the hour ?
my father was a mechanical engineer . . . most ingenious man i ever knew .
well , my father left us when i was five years old . he was not the most ingenious man i ever knew . . . let s get back to brown williamson . if you decide to go on minutes , i got to know everything about why you got fired .
why ?
they are gonna dig up stuff from your past , they are gonna throw it at you . i got to know what they are gonna throw . you understand ?
i drink . a couple of occasions more than i should have . i was cited for shoplifting once . but it was a mistake . . . i pushed liane one time . we were both stressed out because of the pressure . she went to her mother s . i got fired because when i get angry i have difficulty censoring myself . and i do not like to be pushed around !
i am not pushing you around ! i am asking you questions .
i am just a commodity to you , are not i ? i could be anything . right ? anything worth putting on between commercials . . .
. . . to a network , probably , we are all commodities . to me ? you are not a commodity . what you are is important .
no .
you should . because when you are done , a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion , my friend . and that is the power you have .
you believe that ?
i believe that ? yes , i believe that .
you believe that because you get information out to people . . . something happens ?
yes .
maybe that is just what you have been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job ? having status ? and maybe for the audience , it is just voyeurism ? something to do on a sunday night . and maybe it will not change a fucking thing . and people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry . used up ! broke , alone !
are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here ? ! i never abandoned a source !
i do not think you really understand
no , do not evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or minutes with this cheap skepticism !
i have to put my family s welfare on the line here , my friend ! and what are you putting up ? you are putting up words !
words ! while you have been dicking around at fucking company golf tournaments , i been out in the world , giving my word and backing it up with action .
they are terrorizing us . death threats ? ! to my family ? my kids ? !
they do this with impunity !
jeff . . .
they get to go home at night . what does it cost these people to do this to us ? nothing ? ! my girls are crying , so fuck them ! i want to tape ! i am done thinking about it .
i will call them , lowell .
. . . to talk about it . to think about it . i had a plan to ease her into it . but , i really i did not know how to do that . . .
. . . they volunteered . a friend owns a large security company .
i heard .
i am going to be a witness for them in their litigation . so i am going to fly to pascagoula to give a deposition . . .
i know . i am going to go there tonight . . .
did you have a good day ?
yeah , great .
i heard about the kentucky gag order . . .
i do not know what to do .
you mean . . . since this morning ?
no . i mean since whenever . . .
run that sandefur piece on nicotine s not addictive . run that on camera . then cut right to wigand with i believe they perjured . . . then go wide to the ceos all taking the oath . back on jeff and play the pause after the word felt on the b side . . .
what ? !
b w may have threatened litigation . . . cbs is on the block . . . but you , i mean , i know how . . .
no .
no ? no , what ?
i do not think that you know for me . . . what it is to walk in my shoes . . . . . . for my kids to have seen it . . . for them to know why i have put them through what i did . . . the public airing of that . . . the testament to why i did what i did . . . you are telling me is not going to see the light of day .
what do you want to do , lowell , look up my ass , too . . . !
everything . . . you . . . say ! and i cannot defend you , man , with one hand tied behind my back ! because you keep from me . . . what they can discover . and they will discover everything ! believe me .
she sued you for back payments of child support ?
she did not sue me . we had a dispute over money . . . i settled it , she dropped the complaint . . . any other questions ?
what ?
some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview . . . where you are saying you were on the american judo team in the olympics . . . ?
what kind of shit is this ? i was not on the team , i sparred with the olympic team . . . okay ?
abc . . . ?
abc telemarketing company .
a can opener ! a . can opener . i canceled payment . . . it was junk . you ever bounce a check , lowell ? you ever look at another womangs tits ? you ever cheat a little on your taxes ? whose life , if you look at it under a microscope , does not have any flaws . . . ?
what does this have to do with my testimony ?
that is not the point .
what does this have to do with my testimony ? ! i told the truth ! it is valid and true and provable !
that is not the fucking point , whether you told the truth or not ! hello . . . ?
i told the truth . . . i told the truth .
and i have got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before the wall street journal runs . i am trying to protect you , man !
that is bullshit , jeff !
you greased the rails !
i greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes . i helped him to say yes . alright . you are not a robot , jeff ! that is all . you got a mind of your own , do not you ?
up to you , jeffrey . that is the power you have , jeffrey . vital insider information the american public need to know . lowell bergman , the hot show who never met a source he could not turn around .
i fought for you . . . and i still fight for you .
you fought for me . . . ? ! . . . you manipulated me . . . into where i am now . . . staring at the brown williamson building . it is all dark . except the th floor ! that is the legal department . that is where they fuck with my life !
jeffrey , where you going with this ? so where you going ? you are important to a lot of people , jeffrey . you think about that . you think about them .
i am on a leave of absence . forced vacation .
you try and have a good time .
yeah . yeah , i will .
no , no . do not call the police ! just tell him i am on the phone with you . . . my name is lowell bergman . . . just tell him that .
you are breaking up . i cannot hear you .
what ?
hello , can you hear me now ?
he does not seem to be listening . . .
alright , now listen to me . i want you i want you to tell him , in these words get on the fucking phone . . . !
i cannot say that !
no , you can . tell him to get on the fucking phone !
for example . james burke , the ceo of johnson johnson . . . when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in tylenol bottles , he did not argue with the fda . . . he did not even wait for the fda to tell him . he just pulled tylenol off every shelf of every store right across america . instantly . and then he developed the safety cap . . . because , look , as a ceo , sure , he is gotta be a great businessman , right ? but he is also a man of science . he is not going to allow his company . . . to put on the shelf . . . a product that might hurt people . not like the seven dwarfs . . .
she is okay .
what do you mean followed you ? did you call the police ?
i do not want to be paranoid . . . i mean , maybe it is a game . some kind of mind game .
well , what do you really think , though ?
i do not know what the fuck i really think ! are they doing it ? is some crank doing it ? are they doing it to make me feel paranoid ? are they doing it for real and do not give a shit what i think ? i do not know ! i do not fucking know .
you called me .
someone put a bullet in my mailbox .
then hold it off the air until you got that . but i want to go to new york . and i want to go on the record . right now !
there is there is no family .
what do you mean there is no family ?
liane has filed for divorce . . .
where you staying now ?
our favorite hotel , honey . . . i checked into room . odd choice ? huh ?
good to meet you , dr . wigand .
mike s our attorney general down here . i was just explaining to jeff , they got a kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today .
right .
now , they tried to get the mississippi court to honor it , but the judge threw it out . . . however , for you , there is a more perilous effect to the kentucky gag order . . .
dr . wigand , you do understand what could happen , do not you ?
. . . i believe mr . sandefur perjured himself because i watched those testimonies very carefully .
part of the reason i am here is i felt that their representation clearly misstated , at least within brown williamsongs representation , clearly misstated . . . what is common language within the company . . . we are in the nicotine delivery business .
and that is what cigarettes are for . . . ?
a delivery device for nicotine .
a delivery device for nicotine . put it in your mouth , light it up , and you are gonna get your fix . . .
you are gonna get your fix . . .
you are saying that brown williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix , not by artificially adding nicotine , but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia . . .
the process is known as impact boosting . . . while not spiking nicotine , they clearly manipulate it . there s extensive use of this technology , know as ammonia chemistry . it allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system .
the straw that broke the camel s back for me and really put me in trouble with sandefur was a compound called coumarin . when i came on board at b w , they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste , and had been unsuccessful . i wanted it out immediately . i was told that it would affect sales , so i should mind my own business . i constructed a memo to mr . sandefur indicating i could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew , we had documentation , was similar to coumadin , a lung specific carcinogen . . .
and you sent the document forward to sandefur ?
i sent the document forward to sandefur . i was told that we would continue to work on a substitute , we were not going to remove it as it would impact sales , and that that was his decision .
in other words , you were charging sandefur and brown williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously . . .
most certainly .
and on march , thomas sandefur , ceo of brown williamson had you fired . and the reason he gave you ?
poor communication skills .
and , do you wish you had not come forward ? you wish you had not blown the whistle ?
yeah , there are times i wish i had not done it . there are times i feel compelled to do it . if you asked me would i do it again ? do i think it is worth it ? yeah , i think it is worth it .
the former executive has reason to bet on being sued , for major cigarette manufacturers . . .
there are times . . . i wish i had not done it . but there are times that i feel compelled to do it . . . i have if you asked me if i would do it again or if it is do i think it is worth it . yeah . i think it is worth it .
it acts as a drug on the body ?
object to the form !
it acts as a . . .
object !
there an echo in here ? your objectiongs been recorded . she typed it into her little machine over there . it is on the record . so now i will proceed with my deposition of my witness . does it act as a drug ?
dr . wigand . i am instructing you . . . . . . not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the brown williamson tobacco company . and in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the state of kentucky ! that means you do not talk ! mr . motley , we have rights , here . . .
oh , you got rights and lefts ! ups and downs and middles ! so what ? ! you do not get to instruct anything around here ! this is not north carolina , not south carolina nor kentucky . this is the sovereign state of mississippi s proceeding . wipe that smirk off your face ! dr . wigand s deposition will be part of this record . and i am going to take my witness testimony ! whether the hell you like it or not ! answer the question , dr . . .
mr . scruggs , jeff wigand . lowell bergman said i should give you a call . . .
my co counsel , ron motley , and i have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the state of mississippi to get the state reimbursed medicaid costs for treating people with smoking related illness . if you would be interested in talking to us , we would certainly like to talk to you . . .
when should we do this ?
possibly , yes . that is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today . that is right . . .
how does one . . . go . . . to . . . jail ? what does my family do ? go on welfare ? if my wife has to work ? who s going to look after the kids ? put food on the table ? my children need me . if i am not teaching . . . there s no medical . . . no medical . . . even on co pay , that is like . . . tuition . . .
seven . . .
and , he gets out there and he has five strokes on us . he has more concentration than anybody i have ever met . it is spooky how he can concentrate .
i would rather play than talk about it . what did you want to see me about ? i do not like being back here .
chapter and verse .
yeah , i know you do . . . you know , i came up through sales . one of the reasons i was a great salesman , was i never made a promise i could not keep . i knew that if i ever broke my promise i would suffer the consequence . . .
. . . we worked together for , what was it , three years . . . ? now , the work we did here is confidential , not for public scrutiny . . . any more than are one s family matters . . .
you threatening my family , now , too ?
now , do not be paranoid , jeff . about the direction of research here , we may have had our differences of opinion . . .
research . . . you declare , as a badge of honor , you do not even know what makes water boil . . .
that is why we hire scientists . . .
okay . i do not believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements . i was paid well for my work . the health and welfare benefits are good . the severance package is fair . i have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which i said i would not .
i appreciate all that , jeff . but , upon reflection . . . we have decided to expand our zone of comfort with you .
well , i would not say
your husband , who has beaten you repeatedly
he
please was at the time brandishing your firearm , trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance friend of long standing
they hate each other
so he says now ! but if not for your cool headed intervention , his tantrum might have ended this schmoe s life and ruined his own . . . as for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place , was not it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man ?
i told you we know each other , baby . mr . massey represented my ex brother in law . martin reiser ?
miles , i know you are busy and that you charge by the hour so i will come to the point . howard and i are planning to marry .
here . got pictures .
. . . and one day , this sweet girl calls me , asks me to lunch . just a shoulder to cry on deal . one thing leads to another and before i know it
we realized we would always been very attracted to one another .
howard !
you did good , massey !
therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet howard i wish to execute a pre nuptial agreement .
and there s no talking her out of it . believe me , i have tried .
they say the massey pre nup has never been penetrated .
she said penetrate . heh heh heh .
we would better go before we get thrown out .
after you , doll .
few suicide attempts , little inpatient stint . naturally , she misses her kids . six weekends a year and alternate yom kippurs seemed harsh to us but hey all s fair . anyhoo , she lives with a nurse , takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop .
so she is uh , flourishing ?
she makes felt wallets . got one right here .
yep . my divorce just came through . shoulda called you . coulda cut a better deal ! my wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children . but , i do not know . guess i am just a softie . after all amanda and me were together for what you would know better than me , marylin . she was your best friend .
well marylin and rex broke up and . . .
i had no idea until after , but
you know , miles , after my wife wife s mastectomy things were never the same . this might sound cold , well , maybe not to you , massey , but . . . i like my women with two boobs .
i just want to make sure that you both
well at the moment , that would be me .
and without it , that party is exposed a sitting duck . no wriggle room .
a wriggle room ! maybe we should put that in the malibu house . screw the screening room !
and we are sure . . .
what part ?
i would just like to have a word with her .
why not ? i am going to have her for a lifetime .
who s the pigeon ?
excuse me ?
who do you want me to kill ?
well i , uh , that is to say mr . dumbarton would like you to uh , neutralize a , uh , business associate by the name of marylin rexroth doyle massey uh dumbart uh , massey .
is that . . . one person ?
here s her picture . . .
mr . dumbarton is , yes .
mr . dumbarton .
no . . .
triple !
who s the pigeon ?
i am sorry . that was unkind and but , we changed our minds . did you really mean what you said on the phone . it was not because you found out about rex ?
oh joe , be happy for us . i will pay you the twenty thousand .
shut up . i was a lawyer . just like you . and my clients ? whores just like you .
grounds ?
uh . . . poetry recitation .
we rest , your honor .
mr . massey ?
sustained .
so . i will not be seeing her ? your clients usually visit me after the settlement .
not this one . not unless her hmo covers plastic surgery , which , incidentally , she does not need .
everyone needs plastic surgery . you need it .
i do not need it .
you want botox ?
what the hell is botox ?
it is a form of botulism . i just inject it into your forehead , and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you cannot raise them . . .
why in god s name would i want . . . ?
no frown lines . new watch ?
it is a lecoultre revers . you can flip the face , and set it for two time zones .
why would you need two time zones ? you never leave beverly hills .
it was a gift from a client .
set one side for bel air .
botox . christ . we had aspirations when we were in college .
we did not .
you were going to be a cardiac surgeon . i was going to clerk for the supreme court .
i was going to play golf . you were going to have asian girlfriends .
denial is not a river in egypt .
i should be in therapy .
got any symptoms ?
yes . the inability to experience pleasure .
oh . that . do not waste time with your queen .
what ?
the center counter defense . the thing is not to move your queen too early .
she cannot really love that idiot , can she ?
what ?
marylin rexroth . she came into my office and signed a pre nup with howard doyle .
doyle oil ? a massey pre nup ? she loves him .
he is the wrong man .
miles ! do not waste time with someone else s queen , either .
thanks , buddy .
is she asian ?
asian ? no .
well . . . i am still . . .
you have the pre nup ?
no . i have the ring . was i supposed to have a pre nup ?
no . you have the ring . wrigley has the pre nup .
oh . i thought maybe gee !
it is your move , miles .
i already made my move , kenneth .
what ?
that was marvin untermeyer .
yes ?
he was rex rexroth s personal attorney .
what do you mean , was .
rex just had a massive coronary . in the middle of a business meeting . he is dead .
marvin says that rex s will is four years old . he never redrafted it .
yes .
so , that is good , right ?
that was oh , shit . what if he is on his way over there ?
huh ?
i do not know , but do not call me marylin .
except for two years when he was in the navy , in korea .
prior to your marriage , what was your profession ?
i was a hostess . for trans world airlines .
what is your husband s profession ?
he manufactures staples and industrial brad tacks . he is very successful .
ruth rabino .
no .
you like kids .
i cannot have a baby with a man i do not love . . . and i cannot submit a child to divorce .
why do you think she did it ?
maybe she wanted a free trip to la . maybe they offered her money . massey is very seductive . who knows .
maybe they put a horse head in her bed ?
in the godfather , after the courtroom scene , frankie pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub .
it is about time .
i said yes .
i think ming is older than tong . what is this ?
oh boy . if he only knew .
yeah . i guess . you know
i will be right back .
and you must be mr . massey .
positano is beautiful . remember when we were there , rex ? we stayed in the santo pietro ? that hotel on the cliff ?
not according to mrs . rabinow .
is not everything ?
dismiss your vows , your feigned tears , your flattery , for where a heart is hard , they make no battery .
did you see the tape ?
not yet .
see the tape . then we can discuss my heart .
what does your lawyer think ?
ruth says you have been too successful , that you are bored , complacent , and you are on your way down .
but you do not agree ?
how do you know ?
why would you be here ?
i told you . i was hungry .
i know you do .
you did not ask me here to pick me up . you could get in trouble for that .
not really . you are not my client . freedom of association . big issue with the first amendment fans . want to go to hawaii for the weekend ?
have you ever been married , miles ?
no .
you do not believe in it .
as a matter of fact , i am a huge fan .
you just have not met the right person .
no . i have not . have you ?
he wants a reconciliation .
see the tape . then we can discuss reconciliation . rex screwed up and i nailed his ass . now i am going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it . then i am getting on with my life . that is all i am after .
gotcha .
what is it you are after , miles ?
oh , i am a lot like you just looking for an ass to mount .
well , do not look at mine !
and you have always loved him ?
yes . why is that so difficult for you to understand ?
have you ever met mr . rexroth ?
that is true , is not it miles ? your pre nup is the best there is ?
that is correct . not to blow my own horn , but they devote an entire semester to it at harvard law .
absolutely .
to him ? he is a sick freak .
he is passionate .
passionate ! he is a pervert . he should have to register when he moves .
all girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time .
marylin ! listen to me .
no . you listen to me . you busted me , miles . you left me with nothing ! what did you expect me to do ? get a degree in counseling ? write a book about table linen ? because that is what wives do when they get dumped , and frankly , i am not quite ready for that .
but why him ?
we told you . we realized we have always been in love .
so i hear . is that all ?
no , that is not all .
howard is a beautiful person .
yes . he is a diamond in the rough . and i have a feeling that someday soon you will be taking that diamond and leaving the rough .
miles . miles . miles .
i am thrilled for you , but tell me this . . . how would you get howard to do it ? i have addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion , but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea .
it was his idea . it was a gesture of love and trust . be happy for me , miles .
well , when this goes south promise you will have dinner with me ?
have you tried the duck ?
i figure a couple of months . that is how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry .
although knowing you as i do there will be no settlement . this time it will be complete and total annihilation .
i do not feel victorious miles . i feel betrayed , abandoned and humiliated . i have pictures of him with another woman . . .
more pictures ? my god , marylin . you can open an erotic art gallery .
did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs .
no . just to comfort you , and appreciate you
you really think i engineered the whole thing . you think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme . you came here to celebrate because you think i am without morality or soul . you sound like my mother .
miles ?
yes ? marylin ?
you are right about me . i am worthless . i am nothing . i do not deserve to live .
marylin ? when did i say . . . ?
i do not blame them for betraying me . i do not blame rex , or howard or my father . you see , miles , i am going to tell you something about me . something you may or may not know . i suck !
marylin ? forgive me but are you drunk ?
a little . you get out of the car . that is right , fuctard . i am talking to you !
you should not be driving . where are you ?
i am on sunset . near the beverly hills hotel . wanna meet me for a drink in the polo . . . ?
i live right near there . the block of maple . come here . marylin come here right now before just come here .
okay . should i stop at starbucks and pick up a blended for
no . do not stop .
okay miles .
thank you .
you have wonderful art . i love that lithograph . hockney ?
yes . i just got that , actually . it was a gift .
from a girlfriend .
no . no . i do not have a . . . no . it was from a client .
no kidding . i will bet you have some very grateful clients . what would rex buy you ?
rex sent me two humidors full of pre castro cubans .
me . yes .
oh . and that is mom ?
yeah . mom . mom and brother .
you look like you were a very sensitive child . you have expressive eyes .
and your mother was very beautiful . she must be proud of you .
she never particularly cared for me .
she did not love you ?
no . she loved me . she would never not love her son . she just did not . . . i was not her type . she said i was a very , colicky baby . you know ? difficult . not a good sleeper ? did not eat well ? we got off to a bad start , and she never seemed to recoup
she held that against you ?
apparently she was very disappointed .
boy . boy , oh boy .
your mother was .
oh right . you met patricia .
no , we are not !
we are , miles . you know i am right . there s something off about you and me miles . and maybe it is not because of these women maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our deficiencies very early on . maybe . . .
that is bullshit ! mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho . i cannot believe you are saying this , marylin ! there s nothing wrong with us . we are attractive and charismatic and successful and . . . i like us .
i am sorry miles . you should not listen to me . i am sure you have a very fulfilling life . i would better go . i am depressing .
no .
thank you for the coffee . it is very robust .
do not go . stay with me for a while .
i am a little embarrassed . i am not used to losing control with such volume .
and i am not used to marylin there s something i want to ask you .
what is it miles ?
i want . . . i want to . . .
huh ?
no . . . that was not right . i want you to be my wife .
did you just propose to me ?
yes . i am . what else could those words mean ? i believe we belong together and we can make one another happy . and we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is just jump in any old time , marylin . you have more experience at this than i do .
yes .
yes ? yes , you do have more experience ?
yes , miles . i accept .
you do ?
do you want me to sleep on it ?
no .
do you want to sleep on it ?
no ma am . i have been asleep all my life up to this moment . marylin , will you marry me ?
yes . again .
i know .
i have a watch .
yes . short notice you know , but i think there s nice closure to it . hello judge muson . a pleasure as always .
oh miles !
what i mean is , your wealth is completely protected .
i want this to be a marriage based on love , trust and community property . that is all i have ever wanted .
no . stay . i want you close to me . this couch is wrong . it is not a married couch .
in fact , this is not a married house it is a bachelor pad .
hardly . you have six bedrooms
i know . but i have converted most of them into ridiculous guy rooms a billiard room , a card room , a gym honey , want you to go out , as soon as you feel up to it and buy married things . woman things . personalize it . marylinize it . make this your house .
well , i suppose i could girly it up for you with a little fortuny , and some passementerie
good . are those foods ?
fabric and fringe .
exactly . and then maybe not right away there s a room right off the bedroom it would be perfect for a nursery . it is a walk in humidor right now but if i took out the refrigeration unit
miles .
i think a nursery should be right off the master suite . my parents put mine in the guest house . apparently they did have a fisher price intercom , but my mother turned it off when i was seven months old because i was so
hello marylin .
i have a surprise for you .
i bet .
i love you . i want to have your baby .
that is wrong miles ? did i spend too much ?
can you marylin ? can you return the trust ? can you return the hopes ? the dreams ? can you just . . . send it all back for store credit ?
miles ? you are scaring me .
i am sorry , darling . i love it . it is chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and . it is you , marylin . it is you .
may i come in ?
i do not know . maybe i should grab my mace . i am a civil attorney . i have little experience with the criminal mind .
i would just like to pick up a few of my things
i do not believe you have things .
on the contrary . we are married and we have no pre nup , so a case could be made that everything in here is mine .
what do you want ?
i want to nail you ass .
are you threatening me , because i am sure that is a violation of the terms of your bail .
i am reporting you to the irs .
the irs ? they owe me . i am expecting a refund .
i am not talking about dollars , studmuffin . i am talking about
what kind of stuff ?
those are gifts .
salary . unreported income . by the way , what time is it on bellagio road ?
you cannot prove anything .
i do not have to . that is what the irs guys do . and they do it with great zeal . see , they work at these tortuous civil service jobs , and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies , these saps feel . . well , they feel like saps . and they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel wrath . what is this ? a romeo and julieta ?
you are out of your league , marylin . rexroth was a primate . i am a professional .
i know . so am i , right ? and so is agent wilson of the internal revenue service . he is a dedicated , underpaid graduate of southwestern university very tenacious , and never more so than when he is dealing with an unscrupulous colleague . i think it is only fair to warn you i am going to file an action , miles . and after a decent interval i plan to have ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within feet of my house .
meaning my house .
i believe the residence will be part of the settlement .
did our marriage ever mean anything to you ?
drop the bogus forgery charge and i will forget about your generous friends slash clients .
that is blackmail .
that is marriage .
marylin ?
miles ? miles ! where have you been ? i have been trying to get in touch .
you have to leave the house immediately !
i will , miles . i will leave . but miles
no buts . now . out .
just listen to me . i am sorry , miles . it is true that my initial intention was to . . .
please ! leave the house .
i fell in love miles .
so did i . now pack up a few basics and
you do ? you do love me ?
marylin !
it is okay joe .
now . but first , he worked for you .
you were going to have this thug . . . ?
wait just a second there . you sent him here . you unearthed this pestilence .
that is true .
i am not leaving you . i took self defense
hello miles .
hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us .
it is not something i wanted either .
but then i guess something inside me died when i realized that you would hired a goon to kill me .
yes . i know . it is exactly how i felt when i realized you would hired the goon to kill . . .
your forgetting rex rexroth ?
you are forgetting howard doyle ?
forgery ? fraud ?
income tax evasion ?
murder ?
murder !
i do not see how we can ever find our way back from . . .
fine . they were created during a dictatorship . what if something happened to you ? what would i tell little gus when he asked what was my daddy like ?
i thought so .
look , marylin , cannot we have a civilized discussion about this ?
we are . and it is winding down .
but marylin , you know a divorce would ruin me right now . everything i have everything we have is tied up in my business . the business is my entire life .
are you forgetting about the atcheson , topeka and the santa fe ?
marylin ?
rex . go away . i do not want to have to sic the dogs on you .
dogs ?
marylin .
are you alright ? you lost weight .
my whole metabolism is off .
you have some ?
sometimes i forget .
we were about to request the primary residence , and thirty percent of the remaining assets .
thank you , mrs . rexroth .
jesus .
please !
you used his credit card .
he told me to he said he wanted me to
quite a little shopping spree . how do you spend six figures in less than six hours ? oh , never mind i have seen it before . i have seen everything .
do you think he set me up ? do you think that was his intention ?
like i know his intention ? or yours for that matter ? i should join sam . i am too old for this bullshit .
he never even asked . he just assumed
he was right , was not he ?
so . now what ?
now ? well , marylin , now you cut a deal or find out how jean harris made it work for her .
i did not know barry had a beach house .
neither did i until my lawyer found it quite a paper trail he had it in the dog s name .
she did a harriman .
wow .
in the words of my private investigator , we are going to nail his ass .
of massey myerson ?
do you know him ?
by reputation . he got ann rumsey that cute little island of george s .
now ? she is a night manager at mcdonalds .
we do have a man for you .
i wish i had your discipline .
well what does he want ?
i do not know . ruth kept her cool , but i could tell she was surprised .
he has a reputation for being tough .
oh , god !
i am dying .
so where are you now ?
well , if he continues to maintain this position we are in court .
shit .
get this ! he called and invited me to dinner .
they bought her speech . if i was only in it for rex s money , he should not have to give me any .
so , marylin . is that what you said when you were a little girl ?
probably . every woman in my life was divorced at least twice . what was i supposed to say . anthropologist ?
no . i will see some blood before this is over , but it will not be mine .
hello miles .
i want to be exposed .
it is not ming . it is tong .
what about rugs ? i thought we were stopping at mansour ?
right .
he is not what i expected . he is very he is so happy .
but you are going through with it ?
yes , yes , it is just you know i have never been the first wife . rex was married before me .
so what ?
miles is different . he is still so idealistic .
well , that is about to change big time .
he has no cynicism or anger . for once i am not the repository of rage at some other woman .
soon , you will have your own rage !
i guess .
he would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in palm springs . he had a device he called the intruder .
yes ?
you are miles massey ! you probably do not recognize me . the drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair .
excuse me ?
you ruined my life you sonofabitch . gimme those .
he tricked you . with a phony wife and a fake pre nup . howard doyle . he got you . you married marylin , did not you ? you thought she had money . ha ha ha . howard doyle made you think that because of what you did to me . and to marylin rexroth . yeah . i heard all about it . my brother howard doyle got you . neener neener neener .
when you have a moment .
please ! no calls ! i am feeling very fragile .
i am sorry , mr . massey , but i felt certain you would want to know marylin rexroth wants to see you .
marylin rexroth ? when does she
she is here now .
sam is sam . he is taking up fly fishing . he is in a yert in montana .
a yert . ruth is a living legend , rex . at a time when most women are in boca , having early bird specials she is working so her husband can be in montana . in a yert .
oh , just a routine mammogram . she said to say hello . she is going to positano with your brother s family .
at this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation .
my client has ruled that out .
my client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice .
that is delusional .
my client proposes a thirty day cooling off period .
my client feels sufficiently dispassionate .
my client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order .
ha ha .
heh heh .
my client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets .
why only fifty percent , ruth ? why not ask for a hundred percent ?
oh brother . here we go .
why not a hundred and fifty percent ?
yes . maybe you are right , miles . maybe we are being too conservative . seventy five percent .
kirshner does not apply . kirshner was in kentucky .
rephrase . mrs . rexroth , have you ever been in love ?
marylin was friends with howard and amanda doyle . they do not like the way you operate . they helped her .
he never ate the pre nup , did he !
i have no idea what howard doyle eats . i am not a damn dietician .
did marylin end up with money ?
she is your wife . why do not you ask her ? anyway , i assume she signed the highly over rated massey pre nup .
i do not have a pre nup
do not give me that crap . that is my crap .
and it is good !
i will have you suspended . i will have you disbarred .
do not threaten me , miles . i did nothing illegal .
. . . why did she do it , ruth ? why ?
that is attorney client privilege . sorry , miles . but as a great and clever man once said , that is good for the goose
we have outlined a settlement . . .
rex , please .
miles massey . please sit , relax , and consider this office your office , your haven , your war room for the duration of the campaign .
thank you .
now rex .
that is her job . you have to respect that .
when i first met marylin well , we were crazy about each other . not emotionally , of course . we just could not keep our hands off each other .
mm .
but then . . . but then . . .
no . not exactly . it did not exactly cool . marylin is a knock out . and very sexy but there s a lot of it out there .
ah .
you know what i mean when i say it .
gotcha . no need to get anatomically correct with me , rex .
seems like there s more of it than ever before
well , with the expanding global population let me ask you this your wife . has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the knock out , sexy woman you described ?
i do not know . i can assume . . .
not in court you cannot . has she retained counsel ?
i am not sure .
and your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities ?
video .
mmm . . . and to cut to the chase , forensically speaking is there a pre nup ?
that is the problem . i cannot afford to give her anything .
nothing ?
i know that sounds rough but i am about to close on a deal to develop some mini malls , and i am mortgaged up to my ass . if this deal goes south , i am ruined i will lose millions .
so , you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part , your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear ?
well is that possible ?
please let me handle this . okay , ruth , forget kirshner that is your bottom line ?
she always looked out for me .
and she had private investigators assisting her .
she brought my digestive enzymes .
in anticipation of making you sick .
maybe i should reconsider my . . .
nothing .
and she has . . . ?
video .
what the fuck . . . ?
sorry .
sometimes i have serious doubts about you .
i am very sorry .
am i mentoring the wrong mentee ?
no . you are not .
i could be mentoring kramer . kramer clerked for scalia .
i cannot help it . even with the business we are in , i it gets me every time . it is so optimistic .
is she going through with it ?
what are they ?
berry spoons .
spoons ! honestly wrigley , i am surprised at you . what is this ? some martha stewart suggestion ? those are the most cockamamie things i have ever
miles why so angry ?
ha !
. . . and i hear she is richer than croesus .
ah , but is she richer than mrs . croesus ?
she could buy and sell you ten times over .
she deserves every penny . they pay great athletes a fortune . well , marylin rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power .
what . . . ?
she owes me a meal .
i would stay away from her , miles .
i know you would , wrigley . but would kramer ?
miles .
kenneth this is my associate , wrigley . wrigley this is my friend , dr . beck .
the plastic surgeon ! i read about you in la style .
do you have it ?
we wanted ruth here for your protection as well
the judge is here . over here , judge munson .
the coin ?
should we counsel fear or trust ? should we seek to destroy or to build ? should we meet our clients problems with cynicism or with love ?
we do not have much of a relationship anymore . i have not seen her since before she married rex . we had some very nice times prior to that . we were quite close .
mother ?
hard to believe i know . i am sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters .
you were never invited to meet your son in law ?
no . uh uh . i do not think so . hmm ? no . well . . . no .
of course . of course she was married . what else would she be ? single ? i do not think so .
who s patty .
oh . that is her name . patricia . like mine . i was pat and she was patty . but she changed it after seeing some like it hot . to marylin . after marylin monroe .
i see . and what were you going to tell us about patty slash marylin ?
when she was a tiny girl ? and people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up ? she never said the usual things little girls say like nurse ballerina anchorwoman ? she always said when i grow up , i want to be divorced .
well , not just divorce . she used to say i want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy . . . and i guess her dream is coming true . i am happy for you patty
ramona ! do not get mia farrow on us .
three is not farrow .
who s rex s guy ?
muriel rumsey .
maybe next time .
she is keeping his name . and one of his planes . and all seven of his children
and only two are hers .
well , you can live here as long as you want . do you have any plans ?
what i am asking is not impossible . my daughter is somewhere between here and miami . i want her found !
i have put extra men on , all along the way .
it is not enough ! are you certain she is not with king westley ?
no . he is been trailed twenty four hours a day since this thing started . he cannot even get a phone call we do not know about .
i am worried , lovington . after all , something might have happened to her .
yes , sir ?
how is she ?
whyuhshe is all right , sir .
that is the matter ? anything wrong ?
oh , no , sir . no different than
yes . i know . still in the dumps , huh ?
yes sir . if you will excuse me , sirshe sent me for a drink . andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs , following which the scene dissolves to the upstairs corridor in front of ellie s door . andrews enters and knocks several times . receiving no response , he gingerly opens the door .
i found a million dollar baby
you need not see anybody . you can come directly to my study . i would appreciate it very much if
nono . what the deuce do i want to
yeah .
come in . sit down .
that is typical of your daughter . takes those things for granted . why does she think i lugged her all the way from miami for the love of it ?
please understand me . when i say she did not tell me anything about it , i mean not until a little while ago . she thinks you are entitled to anything you can get .
oh , she does , huh ? is not that sweet of her ! you do not , i suppose .
do not know . i would have to see on what you base your claim . i presume you feel you are justified in
if i did not i would not be here ! i have got it all itemized .
and this is what you wantthirty nine dollars and sixty cents ?
why not ? i am not charging you for the time i wasted .
yes , i knowbut
that is the matter ? is not it cheap enough ? a trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars !
let me get this straight . you want this thirty nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars ?
what ten thousand ?
the reward .
who said anything about a reward !
i am afraid i am a little confused . you see , i assumed you were coming here for
all i want is thirty nine sixty . if you will give me a check i will get out of this place . it gives me the jitters .
you are a peculiar chap .
we will go into that some other time .
the average man would go after the reward . all you seem to
listen , did anybody ever make a sucker out of you ? this is a matter of principle . something you probably would not understand . when somebody takes me for a buggy ride i do not like the idea of having to pay for the privilege .
you were taken for a buggy ride ?
yeahwith all the trimmings . now , how about the check . do i get it ?
a guy that would fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined .
that is an evasion .
she grabbed herself a perfect running mate . king westley ! the pill of the century ! what she needs is a guy that would take a sock at her every daywhether it is coming to her or not .
do you love her ?
a normal human being could not live under the same roof with her , without going nuts . she is my idea of nothing !
i asked you a question . do you love her ?
yes ! but do not hold that against me . i am a little screwy myself .
i do not want to eat ! and there s one more thing i do not want ! definitely ! that is to see you .
why do not you put me in chains ?
i might .
all right ! put me in chains ! do anything you want ! but i am not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat !
i will not stand for it ! i will not stand for your running my life ! why do you insist on it !
you ought to know why . because
yes . i know . because i am your daughter and you love me . because you do not want me to make any mistakes . because
because marrying that fool king westley is
you are wasting your time . i am already married to him .
not so far as i am concerned , you are not . yes ?
if gandhi had a chef like paul , it would change the whole political situation in india .
you cannot tempt me . do you hear ? i will not eat !
please . i cannot fight on an empty stomach . remember what napoleon said .
i hope you are not comparing yourself to napoleon . he was a strategist . your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe .
south america .
south america !
we leave miami in an hour . soongs we get some supplies aboard .
you will have a corpse on your hands ! that what you will have . i will not eat a thing while i am on this boat .
in that event , we will not need so many supplies .
what do you expect to accomplish by all this ? i am already married !
i will get it annulled .
you will never do it ! you cannot do it !
i will do it if it takes every penny i have got . i will do it if i have to bribe that musical comedy justice of the peace ! i will do itif i have to prove that you were dragged in , staggering drunk . you probably were . mmmmmm . this filet mignon is divine !
what have you got against king westley ?
nothing much . i just think he is a fake , that is all .
you only met him once .
that was enough . do you mind handing me the ketchup ?
you talk as if he were a gigoloor something .
never mindi will get it myself . gigolo ? why , you took the word right out of my mouth . thanks .
he is one of the best fliers in the country . right now he is planning a trip to japan .
you are going to finance him , i suppose .
why not ? look what he is doing for aviation . it takes courage to do what he does . and character ! at least he is accomplished something worthwhile . i suppose you would like to have me marry a business man . well , i hate business menparticularly if you are a shining example .
he is no good , ellie , and you know it . you married him only because i told you not to .
you have been telling me what not to do since i was old enough to remember . i am sick of it !
i will not thank you ! i will never thank you !
please do not shout .
i will shout to my heart s content ! i will scream if i want to .
ah ! coconut layer cake . nice and gooey , too . just the way i like it .
oh , hello , dad .
i knocked several times .
sorry . must have been day dreaming .
well , everything s set . creating quite a furor , too . great stunt king s going to pull .
stunt ?
landing on the lawn in an autogyro .
oh , yes . i heard .
yes . personally , i think it is silly , too .
nothing .
you have been acting so strangely since you returned . i ami am worried . i have not bothered to ask you any questionsi is not all this what you wanted ? you have not changed your mind about king , have you ?
oh , no .
if you have , it is not too late . you know how i feel about him . but i want to make you happy . you gave me such a scareiwhen i could not find you . you know , the old pump is not what it used to be .
sorry , dad . i would not hurt you for the world . you know that .
on the road .
now , do not tell me you fell in love with a bus driver !
no .
who is he ?
i do not know very much about him . except that i love him .
well , if it is as serious as all thatwe will move heaven and earth to
it will do no good . he despises me .
oh , come now
he despises everything i stand for . he thinks i am spoiled and pampered , and selfish , and thoroughly insincere .
ridiculous !
he does not think so much of you either .
well !
he blames you for everything that is wrong about me . thinks you raised me stupidly .
fine man to fall in love with .
he is marvelous !
well , what are we going to do about it ? where is he ?
i do not know .
i would like to have a talk with him .
it is no use , dad . i practically threw myself at him .
well , under the circumstances , do not you think we ought to call this thing off ?
no , i will go through with it .
but that is silly , child . seeing how you feel , why
it does not matter . i do not want to stir up any more trouble . i have been doing it all my life . i have been such a burden to youmade your life so miserableand mine , too . i am tired , dad . tired of running around in circles . he is right , that is what i have been doing ever since i can remember .
is that his name ?
yes . peter warne .
why ? do you know him ?
oh , nono .
you have not heard from him , have you , dad ?
why , no . . . do not be silly .
oh , please , dad
i am sorry you read it .
are you going to see him ?
i suppose so .
certainly ! pay him off . he is entitled to it . he did an excellent job . kept me thoroughly entertained . it is worth every penny he gets .
well , if it is not the groom himself ! you are just in time , king .
yes . i know . well , you can help now . i issued a statement yesterday that i have withdrawn my objections . begging her to come home . i have not heard from her . apparently she does not trust me .
why should she ? after all
all right . that is why i sent for you . there s a room full of reporters out there . i want you to make a statementthat you have had a talk with methat we have reached an understandingthat if ellen comes home , i will not interfere with your marriage . will you do that ?
if you really mean it , i will .
of course i mean it ! i do not care whom she is married to as long as i can get her back .
she has not had a thing yesterdayor today .
been sending her meals in regularly ?
yessir . she refuses them all .
why did not you jam it down her throat ?
it is not quite that simple . i have dealt with prisoners in my time , but this one
absurd ! all this fuss over a snip of a girl . i am going down to see her myself .
lower the boats !
terrible ! nothing terrible about her . she is great ! marvelous youngster ! got a mind of her own . knows just what she wants . she is not going to get it though . she will not get very far . has no money .
what about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that ?
holy smoke ! i forgot all about that . send a wireless at once , lovington detective agency . daughter escaped again . watch all roadsall transports and railroad stations in miami . have your new york office keep tabs on king westley . intercept all messages . want her back at all costs !
you have made that quite evidentwith all your threats of annulment . well , it has not bothered me for a minute . ellie and i got married because we love each other . and she is proving it as far as i am concerned there s going to be no annulment .
you have got a good thing and you are hanging on to it , huh ? all right , you win . i will just have to get used to you . i admit i am licked . but only because i am worried . i have had detectives all over the country searching for her . i have seen thousands of photographs . fortune tellers , nuts , every crank in the country has written me . have not slept one night this week . if i do not find her , i will go crazy .
naturally . you are going to become a partner in a big institution . it is one of the largest in the world .
you talk as if
someday perhaps , you might even take charge .
no ? say , listeni have devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat . toughest job i ever tackled . ever hear of j . p . clarkson ? biggest man in the country , is not he ? well , i tamed him . got him eating out of the palm of my hand . i have browbeaten financiers , statesmen , foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut i have never been able to do a thing with her . she is been too much for me . i am glad you think it is easy . now listenif you will do what i tell you , perhaps i might develop a little respect for you . you never can tell .
what would you like to have me do ?
sock her !
yes , sir .
fine . i will see you at the reception .
why , it will make all the front pages . a spectacular thing like that
personally , i think it is stupid ! but go ahead . have a good time . as long as ellie does not object .
oh , no . she will be crazy about it . well , see you later . i am going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space . goodbye .
we have done that already .
yes , of course .
i have not the slightest idea .
any others ?
yessir . there s a report here from every state along the east coast . want to hear them ?
what do they say ?
they are practically all the same , sir .
amateurs !
they are the finest detective agency in the country , sir .
but it is king westley on the phone .
ooooooh . hello my would be ex son in law . i have sent you a check for a hundred thousand . yes . that is the smartest thing you ever did , westley , not to contest that annulment . that is satisfactory , is not it ? yeah . well , it ought to be . oh i am not complaining . it was dirt cheap . do not fall out of any windows .
there s another wire from peter , sir . they are in glen falls , michigan .
that is holding up the annulment , you slow poke ? the walls of jericho are toppling . send him a telegram right away . just say let em topple .
but the lady says
what happened to your money ?
ma spent it all for the tickets . she did not know it was gonna be so much . we shouldnga come , i guess , but ma said there s a job waiting for her in new yorkand if we did not go , she might lose it .
going without food is bad business , son . why did not you ask somebody ?
i was gonna do it , but ma would not let me . she was ashamed , i guess .
thanks .
tonsil ? me ? no ! me burn a tonsil ? my tonsils will not burn as life s corners i . . .
all right , let it go .
. . . turn .
oh , i see , young people in love are never hungry .
no .
young people in love are very seldom hungry . people in love are very seldom hungry . . .
if you will be good enough to remove those newspapers i will have a seat .
okay ! okay ! keep your shirt on , young feller .
just between you and me , i never intended taking it off .
huh ?
the papers ! the papers ! whadda you mean throwing em out !
ohthe papers
hey , whadda you trying to dokid me ?
oh , i would not kid you . on the level , it actually happened . nobody bought a paper that day . they followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants .
what are you gonna do about the papers ? somebody s gotta pick em up .
it is okay with me . i am not arguing .
fresh guy , huh ! what you need is a good sock on the nose .
look here , partner . you may not like my nose . but i do . it is a good nose . the only one i have got . i always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it . if you decide to do it , make sure you do not miss .
now , that is a brilliant answer . why did not i think of it ? our conversation could have been over long ago .
oh , yeah ?
you win !
yeah ?
these seats accommodate two passengers , do not they ?
maybe they doand maybe they do not .
holy smokes ! you will never get out yourself ! better phone for some help .
phone for help ? we are right in the middle of nowhere . there is not a town within ten miles of here .
now , listen . i am in a very ugly mood . i put up a stiff battle for that seat . so if it is just the same to you scram .
driver !
are you talking to me ?
yes . tell that man to drive slowly .
wellof all thewell maybe you will be interested to know your bag s gone .
yeah . i knew you would catch on eventually .
what happened ?
that cadaverous looking yegg who sat in front of us , just up and took it . boy , how that baby can run !
what am i going to do now ?
do not tell me your ticket was in it ?
no , i have got that , all right . but my money . all i have here is four dollars . i have got to get to new york with it .
you can wire home for some money when we get to jacksonville .
why , noi yes . . . i guess i will .
i will report it to the driver . about your bag , i mean .
no . i would rather you did not .
do not be a fool . you lost your bag . the company will make good . that is your name ?
i do not want it reported !
why , that is ridiculous ! they are responsible for everything that
see here , can you understand english ! i do not want it reported ! please stay out of my affairs ! i want to be left alone . a close up of peter shows him glaring after her .
why , you ungrateful brat !
yes .
that was foolish of me . why did not you shove me away ?
i hated to wake you up . how about some breakfast ?
no , thank you . thank you so much .
seems to me i have already thanked you for that . what time is the next bus to new york ?
what are you excited about ? you missed the bus , too .
you are doing a pretty sloppy job of it . here s your ticket .
my ticket ?
i found it on the seat .
oh , thank you . must have fallen out of my pocket .
what are you talking about ?
just a spoiled brat of a rich man . you and westley will make an ideal team .
will you please tell me what you are raving about !
you will never get away with it , miss andrews . your father will stop you before you get half way to new york .
you must have me confused with
quit kidding ! it is all over the front pages , you know , i have always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry king westley .
i did not ask for your advice .
that is right . you did not .
you are not going to notify my father , are you ?
what for ?
if you play your cards right , you might get some money out of it .
i never thought of that .
listen , if you will promise not to do it , i will pay you . i will pay you as much as he will . you will not gain anything by giving me away as long as i am willing to make it worth your while . i have got to get to new york without being stopped . it is terribly important to me . i would pay now , only the only thing i had when i jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and i had to pawn that to get these clothes . i will give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to new york .
never mind . you know i had you pegged right from the start , you are the spoiled brat of a rich father . the only way you can get anything is to buy it . now you are in a jam and all you can think of is your money . it never fails , does it ? ever hear of the word humility ? no , you would not . i guess it never occurred to you to just say , please mister , i am in trouble . will you help me ? no that would bring you down off your high horse for a minute . let me tell you something maybe it would take a load off your mind . you do not have to worry about me . i am not interested in your money or your problems . you , king westley , your father , you are all a lot of hooey to me .
forget it . i did not do it for you . his voice got on my nerves .
what would you do ? wire one of your friends for money ?
no . it would be useless . father would get the wire before they would .
beat it !
you have your nerve ! here , boy !
that is none of your business .
you are on a budget from now on .
shut up !
are you talking to me !
yeah . come onwe are stopping here for the night .
yeah . yeah , it is a gift .
i just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband .
oh , i forgot to tell you . i registered as mr . and mrs .
oh , you did ? what am i expected to doleap for joy ?
i kind of half expected you to thank me .
your ego is colossal .
yeah . yeah , not bad . how is your s ?
now is not that just too cute ? there s a brain behind that face of yours , is not there ? you have got everything nicely figured out , for yourself , including this .
this ? oh , that is a matter of simple mathematics . these cabins cost two bucks a night and i am very sorry to inform you , wifey dear , but the family purse will not stand for our having separate establishments .
well , thank you . thank you very much , but you have been very kind .
oh , yeah ? it is all right with me . go on out in the storm , but i am going to follow you , see ? yeah . and if you get tough i will just have to turn you over to your old man right now . savvy ? now that is my whole plot in a nutshell . a simple story for simple people . now if you behave yourself , i will see that you get to king westley if not , i will just have to spill the beans to papa . now which of these beds do you prefer ? this one ? all right .
oh , this ? i like privacy when i retire . i am very delicate in that respect . prying eyes annoy me . behold the walls of jericho ! maybe not as thick as the ones that joshua blew down with his trumpet , but a lot safer . you see , i have no trumpet . now just to show you my heart s in the right place , i will give you my best pair of pajamas .
you are not really serious about this , are you ?
all right , do not join the israelites . perhaps you are interested in how a man undresses . funny thing about that . quite a study in psychology . no two men do it alike .
smart aleck !
not at all .
who , me ? why , i am the whippoorwill that cries in the night . i am the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face .
you have got a name , have not you ?
yeah . i got a name . peter warne .
peter warne ? i do not like it .
do not let it bother you . you are giving it back to me in the morning .
pleased to meet you , mr . warne . . .
the pleasure is all mine .
what is it ? why , it is a toothbrush ! thanks . youyou had it pressed .
come on ! hurry up ! breakfast will be ready in no time .
why , you sweet thing , you . where would you get it pressed ?
listen , brati am going to count to ten . if you are not out of bed by then i am going to yank you out myself .
outside !
certainly , outside . all the best homes have em outside .
i cannot go out like this .
like what ?
like this . i have no robe .
heretake mine .
heyyou are little , are not you ?
where is the shower ?
your hair s cute like that . you should never comb it .
i will find it myself .
i met some very interesting women at the showers . we got to chatting about this and that . you know how time files .
hurry up and get dressed .
why , peter ! do not you want to hear about our lovely friends ?
if you did not waste so much time on that wise cracking drummerwe would have been through with breakfast by this time .
i know a couple of truck drivers i would like to have you meet sometime . come on , sit down .
thank you . my , my ! scrambled eggs .
egg . one eggdoughnutsblack coffee . that is your ration till lunch . any complaints ?
nope . no complaints .
i would have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint .
why , you do not have to apologize , mr . warne . you will never know how much i appreciate all this .
what makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning ?
must be the spring .
i thought maybeuh believe you me told you a couple of snappy stories .
he apologized for last night . said he did not know we were married .
just shows you how wrong a guy can be . doughnut ?
thanks . you think this whole business is silly , do not you ? i mean running away and everything .
no . no . it is too good a story .
yes , you do . you think i am a fool and a spoiled brat . perhaps i am , although i do not see how i can be . people who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way . i never have . on the contrary , i have always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom . would you believe it ? this is the first time i have ever been alone with a man !
yeah ?
it is a wonder i am not panic stricken .
um . you are doing all right .
thanks . nurses , governesses , chaperones , even body guards . oh , it is been a lot of fun .
one consolation you can never be lonesome .
it has its moments . it got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father s detectives . ii did it once actually went shopping without a body guard . it was swell . i felt absolutely immoral . but it did not last long . they caught up with me in a department store . i was so mad i ran out the back way and jumped into the first car i saw . guess who was in it ?
santa claus ?
kingking westley was in it .
oh . is that how you met him ?
um hm . we rode around all afternoon . father was frantic . by o clock he was having all the rivers dragged .
say , where did you learn to dunk , in finishing school ?
aw , now , do not you start telling me i should not dunk .
of course you should not . you do not know how to do it . dunking s an art . do not let it soak so long . a dip and plop , into your mouth . if you let it soak so long , it will get soft and fall off . it is all a matter of timing . i ought to write a book about it .
thanks , professor .
just goes to show you . twenty millions and you do not know how to dunk .
i would change places with a plumber s daughter any day .
that is father at work , what will i do ? peter , what will i do ?
do not look at me . i did not marry king westley .
what are you talking about ?
there you go again ! how many times did i tell you to stop butting in when i have an argument ?
well , you do not have to lose your temper !
you do not have to lose your temper ! that is what you told me the last time too . every time i step in to protect you . at the elk s dance when that big swede made a pass at you
he did not make a pass at me ! i told you a million times !
well , you were !
i am sorry i did not take another sock at him .
yeah , and gotten yourself arrested !
aw , nuts ! you are just like your old man ! once a plumber always a plumber ! there is not an ounce of brains in your whole family !
peter warne , you have gone far enough . i will not stand being insulted like this another minute .
you were not so bad yourself .
we could start a two person stock company . if things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums . we will call this one the great deception .
next week east lynne .
after that the three musketeers . i would make a great d artagnan .
how about cinderellaor a real hot love story ?
no mushy stuff . i am running this troupe .
oh , you are ! who made you the manager ?
i did ! it was my idea , was not it ?
you always want to run everything .
if you do not like it , you can resign from the company .
i refuse to resign !
then i will fire you . i will do all the parts myself .
do not be silly . nothing you can do . must be tough on an old womana trip like this .
yes .
at the rate he started , he is probably passed two state lines by this time . the exercise is good for him .
yes , i noticed he was getting a little fat lately . ouch !
that is the matter ?
i was never built for these moonlight strolls . why did we have to leave the bus ?
i do not trust that chatterbox .
not as long as i am alive .
okay with me , if you can stand the starvation diet .
what do you meanstarvation ?
it takes money to buy food .
why , have not you ?
not a sou . i had some before the fainting scene .
you did not give that boy all your money ?
i did not give him anything . you were the big hearted gal . how about wiring your father now ?
never ! i will get to new york if i have to starve all the way .
must be some strange power westley has over you women . how do you expect to get there ?
to new york ?
yeah .
i am following you .
are not you afraid of me ?
no .
okay . hang on to these .
sorry . it is the first time i have ridden piggy back in years .
this is not piggy back .
of course it is .
you are crazy .
remember distinctly father taking me for a piggy back ride
and he carried you like this , i suppose .
yes .
your father did not know beans about piggy back riding .
my unclemother s brotherhad four children . . . and i have seen them ride piggy back .
i do not think there s a piggy back rider in your whole family . i never knew a rich man yet who was a good piggy back rider .
that is silly .
to be a piggy backer it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature .
and rich people have none of those qualifications , i suppose .
not a one .
you are prejudiced .
show me a good piggy back rider and i will show you somebody that is human . take abraham lincoln , for instancea natural piggy backer . where do you get off with your stuffed shirt family ? why , your father knew so much about piggy back riding that he
we are not going to sleep out here , are we ?
i do not know about you , but i am going to give a fairly good imitation of it .
what ?
not if you are more hungry than scared .
all right . you win . let s forget it .
i cannot forget it . i am still hungry .
holy smokes ! why did i ever get mixed up with you !
well , take them off .
what !
all right ! do not take them off . do whatever you please . but shut up about it .
oh , peter
that is got into you ?
oh , peter ! i was so scared .
knowbut
here . eat your head off .
i do not want it now .
thought you were hungry !
wasbut
but what !
was so scaredthat it scared
holy jumping catfish ! you can drive a guy crazy .
what ?
nothing . nothing you would give two cents for .
try me .
does not sound very exciting .
by a strange coincidence , i was thinking of you .
really ?
yeah . i was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy .
what would you say we are supposed to be doing ?
hitch hiking .
well , you have given me a very good example of the hiking
no . but i have got a penknife .
hayin my teeth .
need not rub it in . what are you eating ?
carrots .
raw ?
uh huh . want one ?
no ! ! it is a wonder you could not get me something i can eat .
you do not think i am going around panhandling for you . best thing in the world for youcarrots . had a tough time getting them . if that farmer ever caught megoodnight !
i hate the horrid stuff .
what if nobody stops for us ?
oh , they will stop , all right . it is a matter of knowing how to hail them .
you are an expert , i suppose .
expert ! going to write a book on it . called the hitch hikers hail .
there s no end to your accomplishments .
you think it is simple , huh ?
oh , no !
well , it is simple . it is all in the thumb , see ? a lot of people do it
clever .
number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this . that means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer s daughter .
you figured that all out yourself , huh ?
oh , that is nothing . now take number three , for instance . that is a pip . it is the pathetic one . when you are brokeand hungryand everything looks black . it is a long movement like this with a follow through .
amazing .
hm ? yeah , but it is no good if you have not got a long face with it .
now watch me . i am going to use number one . keep your eye on that thumb , baby , and see what happens .
when you get up to a hundred , wake me up .
yes . but look at all the fun you had . mind if i try ?
you ! do not make me laugh .
you are such a smart aleck ! nobody can do anything but you . i will show you how to stop a carand i will not use my thumb .
mind your own business .
what for ?
i proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb .
why did not you take all your clothes off ? you could have stopped forty cars .
we do not need forty cars .
why not ? i am hungry .
eat a carrot .
never ! i am going in and ask him
if you do , i will break your neck .
come onget in .

a black eye .

yeah . he finally agreed to let us have a room .
what about money ?
talked him out of it . he thinks we are going to stay a week . i will have to think of something before morning .
that is swell !
i am glad you think so . if you ask me , it is foolish . i told you there s no sense in our staying here tonight . we could make new york in less than three hours .

whatever you say , darling .
i heard about your stunt . that is swell , king . just think of itthe groom lands on the lawn with a plane . it is a perfect beginning for the life we are going to lead . it sets just the right tempo . come on , king . you are lagging .

yeahwould not it ?
it is a lotta dough . if i was to run across that dame , you know what i would do ?
what ?
i would go fifty fifty with you .
why ?
cause i am a guy that do not believe in hogging it , see ? a bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball , is what i always say .
that is on your mind ?
five g sor i crab the works .
you are a pretty shrewd baby . we better get away from this gang . talk this thing over privately .
you are not making any mistake , believe you me .
i can use a smart guy like you .
say listen , when you are talking to old man shapeley , you are talking to
do you pack a gat ? a close view of the two shows the smile dying on shapeley s face . he looks up quickly .
huh ?
a gat ! a gat ! got any fireworks on you ?
whyno
that is all right . i got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase . i will let you have one of them .
you are not kidnapping her , are you ?
what else , stupid ! you do not think we are after that penny ante reward , do you ? ten thousand bucks ? chicken feed ! we are holding her for a million smackers .
say , look ! i did not know it was anything like this , seeand
that is the matter with you ! getting yellow ?
but i am a married man . i got a couple of kids . i cannot get mixed up with
sh sh sh ! soft pedal , you mug ! before i what are you trying to do ? tell the whole world about it ! now listen , you are in this thingand you are staying in ! get me ? you know too much .
i will not say anything . honest , i will not .
yeah ? how do i know ? i gotta good mind to plug you . i should not take any chances on you .
you can trust me , mister . i will keep my mouth shut .
orange , new jersey .
got a couple of kids , huh ?
yeah . just babies .
you love them , do not you ?
oh , gee , misteryou would notyou ai not thinking about
you will keep your trap shut , all right .
suresurei will keep my trap shut . you can depend on me , mister .
if you do notever hear of bugs dooley ?
no .
nice guy . just like you . but he made a big mistake , one day . got kind of talkative . know what happened ? his kid was found in the bottom of the river . a rock tied around its neck . poor bugs ! he could not take it . blew his brains out .
okay . just remember that . now beat it .
oh , thanks , thanks , mister . i always knew you guys were kind hearted .
come on , scram ! and stay away from that bus .
sure . anything you say .
al , you cannot tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close . goddamn , sam ! if we do not start reading between the lines here ! y all gotta start thinking on a different level like the cia does . we are through the looking glass . here white is black and black is white .
the interesting thing is the extent to which the warren commission went to make him a communist . they got almost pages and exhibits of the report on this mexico trip and the picture does not even match . i am beginning to think the point of the mexican episode was to lay the blame at castro s door . if oswald , or someone purporting to be oswald , had gotten into cuba , come back , then killed the president , the american public once again would have screamed for a cuban invasion . . .
my instinct is that ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating , and we will end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks . if we call him now , he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we have ever had .
when you are in a war , boss , you use every weapon you got .
not one word . that is an order .
well , what do you expect from a pig but a grunt .
without them , it is going to be near impossible , chief , to prove shaw s connection to the cia . we got the same problem with the governors . all of them . reagan in california will not give us brading , ohio refuses orville townsend , texas on arcacha , and nebraska on sandra moffet .
threat to assassinate president kennedy in dallas , texas , november . information received by the bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate president kennedy on his proposed trip to dallas , texas , etc , etc . . .
i have seen him copying files , leaving here late at night .
because you keep conning me , dean . i read your testimony to the warren commission and . . .
there you go . grain of salt . two sides to every coin .
you tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this clay bertrand and asked to fly to dallas and be lee oswald s layer .
right .
now that is pretty important , dean . you also told the fbi when you met him , he was six foot two . then you tell the commission he was five foot eight . how the hell did the man shrink like that , dean ?
they put the heat on , my man , just like you are doing . i gave em anything that popped into my cabeza . truth is , i never met the dude .
you cannot ever say crime do not pay in louisiana , jim only not as good as it used to . good chowder , ai not it ?
when did you first do business with this bertrand ?
oh , i first heard these street cats jiving about him back in , when i lived down in the quarter .
street cats ?
swishes . they swish , y know . young fags , you know . they would come into my bureau needing help , no bread , and i would say , hey man , i ai not rockefeller , who gonna back you up ? these cornmuffins go to the phone and dial . . .
you knew you were not talking to some low life fag , you know . he had command of the king s english .
did he pay ?
always like tits on a pig . i wish i had a million of those bimbettes .
and oswald ?
like i told to the washington boys , bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his marine discharge . . .
so you saw oswald how many times ?
three , four . he came in with a few cubano swishes one time i remember . . .
mario , jose they wear names like you and i wear clothes . today the name is candy , tomorrow it is butsie . i wish i could help you , jim .
did you speak to oswald in dallas ?
hell , no ! i told this bertrand cat right off , this is not my scene , man . i deal with muni court , i am a hack in nigger town , that kid needs a hot dog .
then how the hell did you get in the warren commission , dean ? except through the phone records in the dallas jail ?
there were no phone records .
of course there were not . cause they disappeared . and yet the commission found you , dean .
i do not know how they got to me . maybe cause i repped him here . the feebees run background checks . on my mama s breasts , man , that is all i got . there was not no conspiracy , jim . if there were , why the hell did not bobby kennedy prosecute it as attorney general , he was his brother for chrissake . how the fuck three people could keep a secret like that , i do not know . it was oswald . he was a nut job . faggot , y know , hated this country .
god s sake , chief . the president was shot .
a bullshit president ! i do not see any weeping for all the thousands of cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the bay of pigs . where are all the tears for the russians and hungarians and chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by kennedy s communist buddies all these damned peace treaties ! i am telling ya jack , that is what happens when you let the niggers vote . they get together with the jews and the catholics and elect an irish bleeding heart .
chief , maybe you had a little too much to drink .
bullshit ! bartender , another round . . . here s to the new frontier . camelot in smithereens . i will drink to that .
i think i will cut out here , chief . i gotta get home .
get home my ass . we are going to the office , have another drink . i want some company tonight .
chief , sometimes i do not know whether you are kidding or not .
i could not be more serious , jack . those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty .
you may not like this , chief , but you are beginning to act paranoid . i mean , you really are .
you found out about dave ferrie going to texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on . you are a goddamn spy .
goddammit chief , why would i ever need to look in your files ? i saw enough here this summer to write a book .
i always lock my files . and you were the only one here today . . . what do you mean , you son of a bitch ?
you know what i mean . i saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer . and a lotta strange people .
yes , but we are talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance . three years later and he is still classified ? they gave us his grammar school records , a study of his pubic hairs . . . put it in context , bill , of what we know about oswald . lonely kid , no father , unstable childhood , high school dropout wants to grow up and be a spy , joins the marines at . he learns russian , he acts overtly marxist with two other marines , but he is stationed at a top secret base in japan where u spy flights over russia originate . he is discharged from the marines supposedly because his mother s sick . he stays home days , then with a ticket from a bank account , he goes to moscow . . .
susie , you are an assistant d . a . , remember . stick to what you can prove in court .
you want facts , bill ? okay . from to only two u . s . soldiers defect to russia . from to , seven defect , six return , one of them another marine a month before oswald . all of them young men made to seem poor , disenchanted .
grab your socks and pull . . . clay bertrand is clay shaw . . .
no ! . . . shaw ! director of the trade mart ? this is incredible .
maybe i have a little more respect for this country s institutions than you do , susie . you tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the mob , the cia , fbi , and army intelligence and who knows what else , when you know you cannot even keep a secret in this room between people ! we got leaks everywhere ! we are going to trial here ! what the hell do we really got ? oswald , ruby , banister , ferrie are dead . shaw maybe he is an agent , i do not know , but as a covert operator in my book he is wide open for blackmail cause of his homosexuality .
hey , where y at , frank ? you are wasting your time here . big jim gave strict orders . no fbi allowed .
it is you i want to talk to , bill .
boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew . . .
your boss got a serious problem , bill . real serious . we know that is been going on at your office
yeah , i guess you do .
you have got nothing , bill . i am talking as a friend now . you are riding on the titanic . time to jump off before you get destroyed along with garrison .
frank , i do not want to hear it .
senator long set your boss up , my friend .
no , i am not . . .
yes , you are . look we know oswald did not pull that trigger . castro did . but if that comes out , there s gonna be a war , boy millions of people are gonna die . that is a hell of a lot more important than jim garrison . goddammit , look at me when i talk to you ! you are too goddamn self opinionated , now shut up . if you got a brain in that thick skull of yours , listen to me . listen real hard .
pretty fast , was not it . the way they let him go .
i am just an investigator , bill . i leave the theories to you lawyers .
you , numa ?
pretty flowery for dave ferrie .
not unless we go for shaw now .
with whose testimony ? willie o keefe ? a male prostitute . jack martini ? a drunk ? vernon bundy ? a dope fiend . shaw s got respect , the newspaper editors , the american bar association they are not . . .
. . . rumor is shaw , a local boy , was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement . no one really knows what they were doing there , but everyone sure saw em . they stood out like cottonballs . i got whites and blacks saw em , but last time i checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote . we still got the negro junkie , vernon bundy , saw em talking at the seawall near lake pontchartrain . but it is tough , boss no one wants to talk about shaw . he is . . .
you know you keep saying that .
keep saying what ?
you are not digging .
who is he , joe ? i have been to every bar , no one wants to talk .
i told your uncle i never met a lawman who was not a punk . you too , bill , even if you are family . he is a big shot businessman . i seen him on the tv news a lot with all the other big shots . a fag , you know . goes by another name down here .
that is the other name ?
shaw . clay shaw .
clay bertrand is clay shaw ? the guy who used to run the international trade mart ?
yeah , that is the big mystery ? everybody down here knows the guy .
so why does he call himself bertrand ?
who gives a shit what he calls himself ?
yeah . clay . i met him sometime in june of at the masquerade bar . dave ferrie took me there , for the express reason to meet him .
twenty dollars each time . hell , it is no secret . that is what i am here for .
and that is where you met oswald for the first time ?
yeah , strange guy . dave introduced him as . . .
go on , willie .
. . . well the party got crazier and crazier , one of those , y know beatnik type things .
the anonymous kind , chief .
at sunday morning ? it is not exactly fresh blood we are sniffing here , boss .
old stains , bill , but just as telling .
y ever heard of a double agent , bill ? i am beginning to doubt oswald was ever a communist . . . after the arrest , camp street never appeared on the pamphlets again . now here s another one for you what would you say if i told you lee oswald had been trained in the russian language when he was a marine ?
no , you are awake , bill , and i am dead serious . and we are going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago . how did you find out dave ferrie drove to texas that day ?
does that bother you , bill ? i always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute , she has to have bad eyesight .
he will never sign a statement , boss , let alone get on a witness stand .
when something s rotten in the land , bill , it generally is not just one fish , we will get corroboration . . . find this clay bertrand . if i were a betting man , i would give you to it is an alias . start checking around the quarter .
and the six of us , with almost no budget and in secret , are going to solve the case that the warren commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars could not solve . we cannot keep up with the crimes in the parish as it is , chief .
the murder of a president , bill , is a crime in orleans parish too . i did not pick you because of your legal skill , you know .
gee , thanks boss .
we are saying that when oswald went to russia , he was not a real defector , that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died , that is what we are saying .
and therefore because oswald pulled the trigger , the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief . that is what you are saying !
i will go you one better ! maybe oswald did not even pull the trigger , bill . the nitrate test indicates he did not even fire a rifle on november nd . and on top of that , they did not even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day .
he had his palm print on the weapon .
it went to the goddamn fbi and they did not find a goddamn thing . it comes back a week later and one guy in the dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all i know he could have taken off oswald at the morgue . there s no chain of evidence , bill . and what about the tow guns actually seen in the depository ? one an enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a mauser , described by deputy weitzman . . . maybe , just maybe , lee oswald was exactly what he said he was bill a patsy . take it at face value . lou , susie , i am going with my gut here . he is got an alias of hidell to buy the rifle , o . h . lee to rent the room , right ? that is in a name , right ? in intelligence , they are assumed to be fake . a name is sort of like a postbox number , a code several different people can use the same name , right ? then why cannot somebody be using oswald s name ?
to frame him , obviously . you got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think , bill ! they are not ordinary crooks .
let s start making some assumptions about the man . why would he leave a path as big as lee harvey oswald s ? this is not a thin trail , gentlemen , it is a very wide one . who found the evidence ? who set him up ? lou , bill , susie , i want you to go back and check all the sightings of oswald in dallas , new orleans and mexico in the summer and fall of see if it is the same guy .
that is gonna be tough . nobody s talking .
i think we should have him in for a little talk .
oh jesus , stoner ! . . . why does not he call me ?
well , they offered you the carrot , and you turned it down . . . you know that is coming next , do not you , boss ?
jesus , they must have been hard pressed to come up with that one .
where you going , boss ?
i do not know , bill , i just do not know .
there s a word orders .
so for those reasons , you are going to trial against clay shaw , chief ? well , you are gonna lose ! we should be investigating all our mafia leads here in new orleans carlos marcello , santos trafficante i can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the government . ruby s all mob , knows oswald , sets him up . hoffa trafficante marcello , they hire some guns and they do kennedy and maybe the government does not want to open up a whole can o worms there because it used the mob to get to castro . y know , castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to john q . citizen . so they close the book on j . f . k . it makes sense to me .
i do not doubt their involvement , bill , but at a low level . could the mob change the parade route , bill , or eliminate the protection for the president ? could the mob send oswald to russia and get him back ? could the mob get the fbi , the cia , and the dallas police to make a mess of the investigation ? could the mob appoint the warren commission to cover it up ? could the mob wreck the autopsy ? could the mob influence the national media to go to sleep ? and since when has the mob used anything but . s for hits , up close ? the mob would not have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude . assassins need payrolls , orders , times , schedules . this was a military style ambush from start to finish . . . a coup d etat with lyndon johnson waiting in the wings .
oh , now you are saying lyndon johnson was involved ? the president of the united states ?
boss , are you calling the president a murderer ?
if i am so far from the truth , why is the fbi bugging our offices ? why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered ? why are federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before ?
maybe cause there s some rogue element in the government !
yeah .
julius caesar brutus and cassius , they too are honorable men . who killed caesar ? twenty , twenty five senators . all it takes is one judas , bill a few people , on the inside , pentagon , cia . . .
this is louisiana , chief . how the hell do you know who your daddy is ? cause your momma told you so . . . you are way out there taking a crap in the wind , boss , and i for one ai not going along on this one . jim sighs , saddened . bill was one of his best men .
i do not see any violence , jim . heart attack , maybe an aneurysm . looks like natural causes .
he would die pretty quick , either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain .
can you ascertain if there s proloid in his system ?
not in a routine autopsy , but if we looked at the spinal fluid , there might be a high level of iodine , but it is difficult to know . whatcha thinking , jim ?
well , it does not make sense , nick he was afraid of dying , then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace , but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes .
if it is a suicide , i seen weirder , jim .
i did .
why ?
well , i wanted to make sure she is the same girl i sent .
i see . . . and why are you experiencing this paranoia ?
well , you see , i have been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since , when i was in korea . . .
no , i did not .
. . . ever called dean andrews ?
no , i did not .
. . . and have you ever met david ferrie ?
no , i would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures i have been shown .
. . . did you ever use the alias clay bertrand ?
no , i did not .
thank you . . . mr . shaw .
dave ?
yeah , you got it . since you are the only straight shooter in that fucking office , i would like an answer from you . did you plant it ?
dave , do you think we are out of our minds ? the whole building s been a zoo since that broke . we cannot get a thing done . reporters crawling everywhere . you think we want that ?
calm down , dave , what ?
i am a dead man ! from here on , believe me , i am a dead man .
what are you talking about , dave ? you were not mentioned in the story . do not jump to conclusions .
you think your investigationgs been all that secret ? you know , when you talk to people , they talk to other people .
what did they . . .
you still questioning any cubans ?
dave , you know that is where this road leads .
it leads farther than that .
dave , just calm down . meet me in the lobby of the fontainbleau in minutes . i will have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name .
the fontainbleau ? minutes ?
yeah . come on , dave , come on our side . i guarantee you the boss will protect you . . . dave ?
. . . give me protection ?
yeah ! he would kill for you dave . he likes you . your mind .
i got no place to sleep . i will meet you in minutes .
listen , dave , why do not we order some room service , have a bite , relax . i will stay as long as you want .
i do not know who to trust anymore . yeah , sure i could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of camels . you got anything new in the investigation ?
i do not have much time . they do not even need bugs anymore . they got these fucking satellite waves . they put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born , right up his nostrils , subcutaneous , between his eyes . he was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment . a nazi rocket scientist father and a commie spy mother . you would never believe half the shit the agency does . i am so fucking tired . have not slept since that shit article came out . why would you guys have to go and get me involved with this ?
did we involve you , dave , or did clay shaw ?
that cocksucking faggot ! he is got me by the balls .
what do you mean ?
photographs compromising stuff . and he will use em . the agency plays for keeps . . . i knew oswald . he was in my civil air patrol unit . i taught him everything . a wanna be , y know , nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch . i treated him good . he would talk about his kid , y know , really wanted her to grow up with a chance , but . . . he got a raw deal . the agency fucked him . just like they are gonna fuck me .
they are agency , too . do not you get it ? cia and mafia together . trying to whack out the beard . mutual interests . they been doing it for years . there s more to this than you dream . fbi fucking hates the cia . navy intelligence got something to do with it too . check out alan pope in miami . jack youngblood . bill harvey . colonel roselli . the shooter , i hear , was a dallas cop the bagman at ruby s club . i heard he shot his own partner . got that ? check out the rich fucks in dallas . h . l . hunt . he is dirty . that is all i know . but the agency always runs the show . check out something called mongoose operation mongoose . government , pentagon stuff , they are in charge , but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows , fun ng games man check out southeast asia that is the next big number the heroin trail . oh , what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive .
do you remember me , mr . garrison ? i met you on carondolet street right after your election . i congratulated you , remember ?
how could i forget ? you make quite a first impression . sharon , could you please bring us some coffee ? i have heard over the years you are quite a first rate pilot , dave . legend has it you can get in and out of any field , no matter how small . . . i am a bit of a pilot myself , you know . flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war .
how could i ? dave , as you know , president kennedy was assassinated on friday . a man named lee harvey oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named jack ruby . we have heard reports that oswald spent the summer in new orleans and we have been advised you knew oswald pretty well .
that is not true . i never met anybody named oswald . anybody who told you that has to be crazy .
but you are aware , he served in your civil air patrol unit when he was a teenager .
no . . . if he did , i do not remember him . there were lots of kids in and out . . . y know .
i am sure you have seen this . perhaps you knew this man under another name ?
no , i never saw him before in my life .
well that must have been mistaken information we got . thanks for straightening it out for us . there is one other matter that is come up , dave . we were told you took a trip to texas shortly after the assassination of friday .
yeah , now that is true . i drove to houston .
what was so appealing about houston ?
i had not been there ice skating in many years , and i had a couple of young friends with me , and we decided we wanted to go ice skating .
dave , may i ask why the urge to go ice skating in texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory ?
oh , it was just a spur of the moment thing . . . the storm was not that bad .
i see . and where did you drive ?
we went straight to houston , and then saturday night we drove to galveston and stayed over there .
why galveston ?
no particular reason . just to go somewhere .
and then sunday ?
in the morning we went goose hunting . then headed home , but i dropped the boys off to see some relatives and i stayed in hammond .
did you bag any geese on this trip ?
i believe the boys got a couple .
but the boys told us they did not get any .
oh yes , well , come to think of it , they are right . we got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them . but you could not approach them . they were a wise bunch of birds .
your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car . dave , is not it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun ?
yes , now i remember , mr . garrison . i am sorry , i got confused . we got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we would forgotten our shotguns . stupid , right ? so of course we did not get any geese .
i see . dave thank you for your time . i am sorry it has to end inconveniently for you , but i am going to have you detained for further questioning by the fbi .
why ? that is wrong ?
dave , i find your story simply not believable .
would you say this leon was actually lee harvey oswald ?
oh , you got that ? banister s pet project . getting paid by the government to work against the government . beautiful . what a mind he had , what a guy , guy . he had all those files .
who was paying you , dave ?
you think i was a getaway pilot for the assassination , do not you ?
i do not know . were you ? who you scared of , dave ?
everybody ! the agency . the mob . the cubans . yeah , follow the cubans . check them out . here , in dallas , miami . check out a guy named eladio del valle . my paymaster when i flew missions into cuba he is somewhere in miami . you are on the right track .
fucking a . how do you think the agency gets people to do their bullshit ? fuck knows what they got on oswald !
same one . i did not know no impersonator .
black , black just give it to me . shit . i am so exhausted . my neck is killing me . i have got cancer . had it for years . i been working with mice , y know , trying to come up with a cure .
dave , can i just ask you this directly ? did you ever work for the cia ?
you make it sound like some remote fucking experience in ancient history . man , you never leave the agency . once they got you , you are in for life .
and shaw ?
shaw s an untouchable , man highest clearance . shaw , oswald , the cubans all agency .
what about ruby ?
jack ? jack was a pimp . a bagman in dallas for the mob . he used to run guns to castro when he was still on our side . check out jack youngblood . shit we almost had castro . then we tried to whack him . everybody s flipping sides all the time . it is fun ng games , man fun ng games .
oh man , why do not you stop . this is too fucking big for you ! who did kennedy ? it is a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma . even the shooters do not fucking know ! do not you get it yet ? i cannot be talking like this . they are gonna kill me . i am gonna die ! i do not know what happened . all i wanted in the world was to be a catholic priest live in a monastery , study ancient latin manuscripts , pray , serve god . but i had this one terrible , fatal weakness . they defrocked me . and then i started to lose everything .
dave , it is going to be okay . just talk to us on the record and we will protect you . i guarantee it .
get some rest , dave , and you will feel better in the morning . we will talk then .
yeah , yeah . but leave me alone for awhile . i got to make some calls .
i was told that the family wanted examination of the head .
as a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death , was it not ?
i had the cause of death .
your honor , i would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question . why did colonel finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck ?
well i heard dr . humes stating that he said . . .
but you were a qualified pathologist . was this army general a qualified pathologist ?
no .
but you took his orders . he was directing the autopsy .
no , because there were others . there were admirals .
there were admirals .
oh yes , there were admirals and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the army you just follow orders , and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told as i recall it was admiral kenney , the surgeon general of the navy we were specifically told not to discuss the case .
what ?
i call em as i see em , jim . i am ruling it inadmissible .
that is our case !
if that is your case , you did not have a case . i would not believe whatever habighorst said , anyway .
i cannot believe you are saying this in the courtroom .
well , i am saying it . bring in the jury .
sure it is . freckle face , if i ever handled a minor felon like that , it would be all over the papers . i would catch hell . and this is the alleged murderer of the president ?
that is something , jasper . what is it ?
a rhinoceros . can i stay up another hour ?
hi , freckle face .
well , it looks like it , jasper .
because of kennedy ? are the same people gonna kill us , daddy ?
no , jasper , nobody s gonna kill us .
there s nothing wrong with feeling a little scared , jasper , virginia . telling the truth can be a scary thing . it scared president kennedy , but he was a brave man . if you let yourself be too scared , then you let the bad guys take over the country , do not you and then everybody gets scared .
well if they can kill the president , they can certainly get me .
that does not make sense , mrs . hill . we have the man that killed the president .
no , you do not !
he kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots . he was getting hot under the collar , and telling the woman not to write when he wanted .
look , do you want the truth , or just what you want me to say ?
i want the truth .
the truth is that i heard between four and six shots . i am not going to lie for you .
. . . you heard echoes .
no . i had guns all my life . i used to go turtle shooting .
i realize you are under a great deal of stress . . it is clouded your judgement .
so off the record , he starts talking about my family , and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like i did not know it or something . he got angrier and angrier and then
look , we can put you in a mental institution . we can make you look crazier n marguerite oswald , and everybody knows how crazy she is .
i knew something was crooked as a dog s hind leg , cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry . . . sure enough , when i finally read my testimony as published by the warren commission , it was a fabrication from start to finish .
how many shots you say you heard ?
four to six .
that is impossible . you heard echoes . . . echoes . we have three bullets and three shots which came from the book depository and that is all we are willing to say .
. . . which is strange cause this is less than minutes after the assassination .
no , i saw a guy shooting from over there . he was behind that fence . what are you going to do about it ?
we have that taken care of . you only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this . no one , you hear ?
i was scared . it was all kinda queer , but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three . . . and then they took mary s five snapshots from me , sent them to washington , and when they returned them weeks later , two of them had the backgrounds mutilated . . . the only one we saved was in mary s camera . i did not want to go to washington when the warren commission subpoenaed me . . . so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at parkland hospital .
negative on his tax records . classified . first time i know a d . a . cannot get a tax record . i put together a list of all the cia files on oswald that were part of the warren report and asked for them . there are about documents . . . oswald in the ussr , in mexico city , oswald and the u , a cia personnel file , a memo from the director on oswald , travel and activities cannot get one of them . all classified as secret on the grounds of national security . it is real strange .
makes sense he is a spokesman .
but he never writes , speaks , or does any propaganda for the russians . he meets marina , whose uncle is a colonel in soviet intelligence , at a trade union dance she thinks he is russian the way he speaks , six weeks later they marry , have a daughter .
none ! the state department issues him a new passport in hours and loans him the money to travel . he is never investigated or charged by the navy for revealing classified information or , as far as we know , debriefed by the cia .
this is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the pacific ! he should have been prosecuted as a traitor !
the fbi finally gets around to talking to him in dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant communist type .
but who meets him when he gets off the boat in new york in june ?
and marina ? does she have a problem getting out ?
none either . it is bizarre . it is next to impossible to get russian sweethearts out . nor does lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to cuba and russia in . a man who has defected once already . it is crazy .
dammit , it does not add up ! ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations ! the state department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to minks to insure oswald s return . only intelligence people can come and go like that .
sort of like benedict arnold coming back to george washingtongs cabinet .
equally incongruous is oswald becoming chummy with the white russian community of dallas all rabid anti communists .
presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at . an hour .
i wonder about the williams . just where did the first description of oswald come from at ? no one knows . they claimed it was brennangs , but his description came after p . m . who called ? somehow the fbi s been tapping the williams and picks up a call between bell helicopter and janet s phone , an unidentified voice saying we both know who s responsible . who called ? why s the bureau been tapping them ?
goddamn ! they put oswald together from day one ! like some dummy corporation in the bahamas you just move him around a board . sent him to russia , in and out , no passport problems . you got the word microdots in his notebook , you got the minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions , the sealed diz personnel file . for all we know , there could be a dozen oswalds in different cities , countries all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination . does the real oswald know he is been put together ? who knows . it does not matter , does it ? he is a low level spy , he does not know who he really works for . . .
bugging the district attorney s office of new orleans ! it is outrageous !
this is interesting are you ready for this ? oswald went to see the fbi two weeks before the assassination . it seems special agent hosty made three routine visits to his house , supposedly to keep an eye on marina oswald .
no , i do not think i am , susie . anyone else ?
i know .
well . . . in an investigation we are conducting your name has come up a number of times .
i would not imagine where .
we recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you . are you acquainted with a david logan ?
no . never heard of him .
a perry russo ?
no .
a willie o keefe ?
no , i do not believe i know anyone by that name .
mr . o keefe told us he met you at the masquerade bar down in the quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on dauphine street . do you recall that ?
not at all . but on the other hand , i do have a lovely chippendale dining table and i often have a friend over sitting at one end while i sit at the other . that is precisely the point of a long dining table . the splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it .
i would imagine a uniformed waiter helps .
it adds a taste of elegance for which i must confess a weakness for now and then . i call him smedley . his real name is frankie jenkins but i could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering frankie ! . . where is this leading to , mr . garrison ?
pffft ! absolute nonsense . the quarter is filled with vivid imaginations , my dear mr . garrison grimy young hoodlums who will say and do anything . as you well know .
. . . in the course of that night , mr . o keefe said a man named david ferrie stopped by the house . . . along with another young man . . .
david ferrie .
no . i have never known anyone by that name . of course never having met mr . o keefe i could hardly have met mr . ferrie . . .
. . . and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours . . .
no . i am sure i have never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance .
does the name clay bertrand mean anything to you ?
clay bertrand ? clay bertrand ? i believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the chamber of commerce . is that the man you had in mind ?
no , it was not . do you know an attorney by the name of dean andrews ?
one meets so many attorneys in my business . no , i do not believe i know dean andrews .
naturally . are you claiming , mr . garrison , that mr . oswald also had dinner with me ?
mr . shaw , did you ever meet lee harvey oswald ?
you really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters , do not you , mr . garrison .
please answer the question .
of course not ! such a pity , that assassination . in fact , i admired president kennedy . a man with true panache , and a wife with impeccable taste .
i am well aware of this asinine article . and i am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper .
it says that this company has heavily fascist ties to the french secret army organization that tried to assassinate de gaulle in .
nonsense . what next ?
. . . and that this company is linked to the schlumber tool company here in houma , louisiana which is where their arms may have come from to david ferrie and his cubans . . .
mr . garrison , you are reaching . i am an international businessman . the trade mart which i founded is america s commercial pipeline to latin america . i trade everywhere . i am accused , as are all businessmen , of all things . i somehow go about my business , make money , help society the best i can and try to promote free trade in this world .
mr . shaw , have you ever been a contract agent with the central intelligence agency ?
no , people like you do not have to , i guess people like you walk between the raindrops .
may i go ? regardless of what you may think of me , mr . garrison , i am a patriot first and foremost .
i have spent half my life in the united states military serving and defending this great country , mr . shaw , and you are the first person i ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president .
now just a minute , sir ! you are way out of line !
yes , it was about in the morning . i was driving west on elm street toward the triple underpass , in a rented car a blue valiant . i will never forget that day .
that is right . when i saw him on tv , i was shocked . i said to my family , that was the man i saw in the truck .
but you did not seem nearly so sure in your statement to the warren commission .
that is what bothers me , mr . garrison . you see , they have been altered . my statements . . .
mrs . mercer , as a former fbi man , it is difficult to accept this .
i know , but mr . garrison , the fbi is just not doing their job .
mmmmm . . . sure smells good . . . but egghead , do you realize oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination , with no lawyer present , and nobody recorded a word of it ? i cannot believe it . a police captain with years experience and a crowd of federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that oswald said would be inadmissible in court .
come on now , we will talk about it at the table , dinner s getting cold . what are you doing in here ?
well maybe you are right , jim . i will give you one hour to solve the case . . . until the kids are in bed . then you are mine and mr . kennedy can wait til morning . come on , everybody say goodnight to daddy .
oh , she did , huh ? when i come up i will show you how saturday night got invented .
it is incredible , honey the whole thing . a lieutenant colonel testifies that lee oswald was given a russian language exam as part of his marine training only a few months before he defects to the soviet union . a russian exam !
i cannot believe this . it is four thirty , jim garrison . i have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and . . .
honey , in all my years in the service i never knew a single man who was given a russian test . oswald was a radar operator . he would have about as much use for russian as a cat has for pajamas .
these books are getting to your mind , mr . garrison . i wish you would stop reading them .
and then this colonel tries to make it sound like nothing . oswald did badly on the test , he says . he only had two more russian words right than wrong . ha ! that is like me saying touchdown here . . . . . . is not very intelligent because i beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess .
jim , what is going on , for heavengs sake ! you going to stay up all night every night ? for what ? so you will be the only man in america who read the entire volumes of the warren report ?
liz , do i have to spell it out for you ? lee oswald was no ordinary soldier . that was no accident he was in russia . he was probably in military intelligence . that is why he was trained in russian .
honey , go back to sleep , please !
goddammit ! i been sleeping for three years !
it will be off the record , honey . i will bring him in on a sunday . a quiet little chat between gentlemen .
you know i do not like these tribal rituals , freckle face . i am interviewing clay shaw this morning .
but why in the lord s name would you do it in the middle of easter sunday when you knew we were . . .
because when i scheduled it i did not realize it was a holiday . you were there , why did not you say something ?
look at the calendar , for christ s sake . you said a sunday , not easter sunday .
i am sorry , but it is important . clay shaw is important . i am sorry .
you are missing most of your life , jim , and you do not even know it . the kids are missing out too . it is not just you making the sacrifice here , honey .
look , i will rush and be there by two , i promise . go ahead without me .
tough day .
my sympathies .
liz , i am really sorry . the meeting went much longer than expected .
we waited for you . . . hours , jim . you could have telephoned , for god s sake . it is easter ! you promised , jim .
i do not know what to say except i am sorry . i just do not have rabbits on my mind .
i think you care more about john kennedy than your family ! all day long the kids are asking , where is daddy ? what am i supposed to tell your kids , jim !
i do not know what to tell them . how about the truth i am doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice will not be an arcane , vanished idea they read about in history books , like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of atlantis .
that sounds dandy , but it does not replace a father and a husband on easter day .
it is going to get worse , honey .
it is not funny , jim , i am scared .
do not be . nothing to be scared about , honey , i been through four years of war this is nothing .
leave us alone for god s sake ! . . . oh , it is lou .
what ?
a man just called . he asked her everything !
your daughter s life was just threatened !
just a crank making phone calls . happens a dozen times a day at the office .
our home , jim ! a kidnapper , a murderer , who knows !
only cowards make crank calls , sweetheart , nothing is going to happen .
how do you know ? how do you even know what goes on in this house anymore ! you are too busy making speeches , stirring up every crazed klansman in louisiana after us !
get a hold of yourself .
i am leaving . i am taking the kids and i am leaving ! i will not stand it anymore .
you and your government ! that is the matter with you ? do not you have any feelings ? your daughter ! what kind of man are you ?
jim , before this kennedy thing , nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children . the other night jasper tried to show you a drawing . you did not even notice he was there . he came to me bawling his little eyes out . jim , he is sensitive he needs more from you .
i promise i will make more time for jasper .
is it such a chore ? i do not understand you .
damn it , if i say i will spend more time with him , i will spend more time with him . i cannot fight you and the world too , liz .
i am not fighting you , jim , i am just trying to reach you . you have changed .
of course , i have changed ! my eyes have opened , and once they are open , believe me , what used to look normal seems insane ! and now king . do not you think this has something to do with that ? cannot you see ?
i do not want to see , goddammit ! i am tired . i have had enough ! they say you do not have anything anyway ! everybody in towngs talking . you are ruining this man shaw s life ! you are attacking him because he is homosexual ! going ahead with this stupid trial ! did you ever once stop and consider what he is going through ?
that is not why i am attacking him ! you do not believe me all this time you never believed me .
oh , i do not know anymore ! i believe there was a conspiracy , but not the government . i just want to raise our children and live a normal life ! i want my life back !
you never talked to me this way before , jim garrison . i am not making any threats . i am leaving you . i am taking the kids to my mother s . i am i am .
i never doubted for a second that i was . will you come to the trial , elizabeth ?
i do not think so , jim . . .
huh ?
he won . . . and they killed robert kennedy . they shot him down .
oh no ! no ! i cannot believe it . i cannot believe it . both of them , both brothers , oh my god !
call me willie . i ai not got nuthing but time , mr . garrison . minutes , hours , days , years of em . time just stands still here like a snake sunning itself in the road . . .
well . . . yeah .
i remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg . he limped . do not get me wrong , he is not one of those , you know , limp wrists . he is a butch john . you would meet him on the street , you would never snap . you could go fishing with him , play poker with him , you would never snap in a million years . so one night we were over at ferrie s place . having a party . sometime in the late summer of .
fuck , yeah ! i told you so . and you can tell em all i told you so .
you realize the things you are saying , willie , are going to be attacked by a lot of different people .
bring on all the motherfuckers ! bring their college degrees in here ! i got nuthing to hide . they cannot buy me . you cannot buy me . i do not even need the parole . this is about the truth coming out . you are a goddamn liberal , mr . garrison , you do not know shit , cause you never been fucked in the ass . fascism is here now , facism is . . .
no one s trying to buy you , willie . it is important to know why you are telling us this .
you wanna know why ? cause that mother fucker kennedy stole that fucking election , that is why ! nixon was gonna be one of the great presidents til kennedy wrecked this fucking country . got niggers all over the fucking place asking for their rights , where do you think we got all this fucking crime now , cause kennedy promised em too damned much . revolution coming . fascism s coming back . i tell ya this the day that communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country . i jes hate to think they are blaming it on some silly fucking oswald who did not know shit anyway . people should know why that sumbitch was killed . cause he was a communist . put me on the stand , go ahead , i will tell the same goddamn story , i am proud of it , do not matter fuck all to me , things do not change .
boss , the president s been shot . in dallas . five minutes ago .
no word yet . but they think it is in the head .
let s get outta here , lou . i saw too much stuff like this in the war .
he is been in trouble before . used to be a hot shot pilot for eastern airlines , but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a year old boy .
yeah , guy banister . ex fbi man . he died couple years ago .
lou , you were in the marines . who would be running that training ?
the office of naval intelligence .
take a look across the street .
upstairs . in that was the office of naval intelligence and just by coincidence , banister , before he was fbi , was oni . what do they say ?
once oni , always oni ?
what are you driving at , boss ?
we are going back into the case , lou the murder of the president . i want you to take some money from the fees and fines account and go to dallas talk to some people . bill , i want you to get oser on the medical , the autopsy , susan on oswald and ruby histories , tax records . . .
i cannot say that comes as a surprise anymore .
a photographer from the dallas times herald got some great shots of them never published . . .
hoboes i knew of old used to sleep in their clothes these two look pretty young .
. . . not a single frayed collar or cuff , new haircuts , fresh shaves , clean hands new shoe leather . look at the ear of the cop . . . that is a wire . that is a cop wearing a headset for ? i think they are actors , chief they are not cops .
we need to find more witnesses , lou .
there was rose cheramie . a whore . two cubans threw her out of a car on the way to dallas .
graveyard dead near big sandy , texas in . two in the morning on some highway . a hit and run .
unless he or someone else wants him to get caught . maybe he never ordered the weapon , lou . somebody else did . it was picked up at the post office early morning when oswald s time sheet shows him clocked in at his job . lou , come alive . these things are not adding up .
i know you do , lou . i am doing three more lectures this month . you are all doing an incredible job , sue , al , numa . but this is one where if you do not nail the other guy , you are dead . how did jack ruby dies so quick ? of what ? cancer , right ? a history of nazi germany , lou . they were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the s . we learned a lot more than you think from the nazis . read this . our biological warfare lab is in fort detrick , maryland . close to where the national cancer institute is located . think about it . think the unthinkable question everything .
and it ai not pretty . . . the ad has spent more than , on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since november , .
i have a plane to catch . . . going to washington . an interesting lead , says he is closely connected to these events , but he will not come down here . . . i know what you are going through with ferrie , lou . we will talk tomorrow .
i am onto ferrie s cuban paymaster , eladio del valle , in miami . i gotta get him in , boss . i need more men i cannot even pull the teams to watch ferrie . . . this is our case !
i would say the opposite hypertension .
between six and seven seconds .
the key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other , and it takes a minimum . seconds to recycle this thing . the other problem is there was a tree right there . . . blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the zapruder film .
did not hoover say something about that ? the leaves had fallen off in november ?
it was a texas live oak , boss . it sheds it is leaves the first week of march . you try to hit a moving target at yards through heavy foliage with this cheap dollar sucker , the world s worst shoulder weapon . no way . the fbi tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match oswald s performance . not one . and oswald was at best a medium shot . the scope was defective on it , too . i mean this is the whole essence of the case to me . the guy could not do the shooting . nobody could . and they sold this lemon to the american public .
the zapruder film is the proof they did not count on , lou . we gotta get our hands on it .
that means we gotta subpoena time life on it .
why not just shoot kennedy coming up houston ? there s plenty of time he is out in the open a frontal shot ?
how many men ?
one shooter . one spotter on a radio . maybe three teams . i would say these were professional riflemen , chief , serious people . hunters . . . patient . it takes skill to kill with a rifle , that is why there s been no execution of an executive with one in years . . . . . . green ! or else abort ! abort !
beats me . city officials . secret service . dallas police . they did a dry run with chief curry a few days before . but they did not bother running through dealey . they stopped right there , said something like , and afterwards there s only the freeway , and went home .
you know who the mayor was ?
no .
earle cabell . and guess who his brother is ?
who ?
general charles cabell . deputy director of the cia . fired by kennedy in because of the bay of pigs fiasco , he moved back to the pentagon , called kennedy a traitor . when he came to new orleans to address the foreign policy association , you know who introduced him ? our friend clay shaw .
the warren commission call him ?
his boss was the one on the warren commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community .
allen dulles ?
head of the cia since . kennedy fired them both . cabell was his deputy for nine years . talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop . now we will have to subpoena them , lou .
they are gonna love you , chief .
you never got anyone killed , boss . their actions killed them years before . if we stopped now , it would be even more wrong .
we need him back .
maybe you did not hear what i said . i will not tolerate this infighting among the staff , i warn you that . . .
boss , then i am afraid i cannot continue working with bill .
well , if that is what you want to call it . i did not ever think it would come to this . i guess i am , boss .
i will not have any damned ultimatums put to me , lou . i will accept your resignation .
you sure got it . you are one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch d . a . and you are making one hell of a mistake !
i sometimes feel things have gone downhill since john kennedy was killed , senator .
do not get me started on that . those warren commission fellows were picking gnat shit out of pepper . no one s gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore .
sure , three experts and not one of them could do it ! they are telling us oswald got off three shots with world class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds and according to his marine buddies he got maggie s drawers he was not any good . average man would be lucky to get two shots off , and i tell ya the first shot would always be the best . here , the third shot s perfect . do not make sense . and then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits kennedy and connally seven times . one pristine bullet ? that dog do not hunt .
you know , something always bothered me about that from day one , and i cannot put my finger on it .
if i were investigating , i would round up the best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in dallas that day . you been duck hunting ? i think oswald was a good old fashioned decoy . what would he say ? i am just a patsy . out of the mouth of babes y ask me .
you think there were other men involved , russell ?
russell , honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire . i just cannot believe the chief justice of the united states would put his name on something that was not true .
honey , another one of these . this one s as weak as cricket pee pee . yessir , you mark my words , jim , vietnam s gonna cost johnson and it is gonna put that other varmint nixon in then watch your hide , cause there ai not no offramps on a freeway to hell !
i have been called everything under the sun , jerry . call me whatever you like .
your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching , jerry . it indicates that the age of innocence is not yet over . but seriously , jerry , people are not interested in jim garrison they want the hard evidence ! they want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to . . .
some people would say you are paranoid .
well , if i am , why is the government concealing evidence ?
are they ? why would they ?
that is exactly my question , jerry . maybe i would better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what i am talking about .
sure they do . the camera can pick this up .
no , it cannot !
yes .
i am glad you came . i am sorry about the precautions .
well , i just hope it was worth my while , mr . . .
i have already been warned by the agency , mr . whoever . if this is another type of threat , i do not . . .
i am not with the agency , mr . garrison , and i assume if you have come this far , what i have to say interests you . but i am not going to name names , or tell you who or what i represent . except to say you are close , you are closer than you think . . .
kings are killed , mr . garrison . politics is power , nothing more . but do not believe me . do not trust me . do your own work , your own thinking .
the size of this is . . . beyond me . testify ?
no chance in hell , mr . garrison . i would be arrested and gagged , declared insane and hospitalized . . . maybe worse . you , too . i can only give you background , you got to find the foreground , the little things . . . keep digging . y know you are the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of john kennedy . that is important it is historic .
i have not yet . i do not have much of a case .
but you do not have a choice anymore . you have become a significant threat to the national security structure . they would have killed you already , but you got a lot of light on you . instead , they are gonna destroy your credibility they already have in many circles in this town . you are some kinda ego crazed southern caricature to many folks . be honest the best chance you got is come up with a case , something , anything , make arrests , stir the shitstorm . you gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack . remember , fundamentally people are suckers for the truth , and the truth is on your side , bubba . i hope you get a break . . .
you did not get that break you needed , but you went as far as any man could , bubba . what can i do for you ?
just speculating , i guess . how do you think it started ?
i think it started in the wind . money arms , big oil , pentagon people , contractors , bankers , politicians like l . b . j . were committed to a war in southeast asia . as early as they knew kennedy was going to change things . . . he was not going to war in southeast asia . who knows ? probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere houston , new york hell , maybe bonn , germany . . . who knows , it is international now .
any chance of one of them confessing someday ?
. . . do not think so . when they start to drool , they get rid of em . these guys are proud of what they did . they did dealey plaza ! they took out the president of the united states ! that is entertainment ! and they served their country doing it .
. . . and your general ?
. . . got promoted to two stars , but he was never military , you know , always cia . went to vietnam , lost his credibility when we got beat over there , retired , lives in virginia . i say hello to him when i see him at the supermarket . . .
ever ask him ?
you never ask a spook a question . no point . he will never give you a straight answer . general y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more .
his name ?
does it matter ? another technician . but an interesting thing he was there that day in dealey plaza . you know how i know ? that picture of yours . the hoboes . . . you never looked deep enough . . .
. . . some story . . . the whole thing . it is like it never happened .
it never did .
just think . . . just think . what happened to our country . . to the world . . . because of that murder . . . vietnam , racial conflict , breakdown of law , drugs , thought control , guilt , assassinations , secret government fear of the frontier . . .
i keep thinking of that day , tuesday the th , the day after they buried kennedy , l . b . j . was signing the memorandum on vietnam with ambassador lodge .
more than ten years .
and he never hit you before ?
never touched me .
yet on november , the day of the president s murder our police report says he pistol whipped you with a . magnum . but the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill . here , take a look at it . now , does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you ?
i do not know if i should talk about this .
well , i would ask guy we were friendly , you know heart attack , was not it ?
if you buy what you read in the paper .
you have other information ?
i did not say that . all i know is he died suddenly just before the warren report came out .
why did guy beat you , jack ?
well , i guess now that guy s dead , it do not really matter . . . it was about the people hanging around the office that summer . i was not really part of the operation , you know . i was handling the private eye work for guy when that came in not much did but that is why i was there . . . it was a nuthouse . there were all these cubans coming and going . they all looked alike to me .
was he there often ?
often ? he practically lived there . it was real cloak and dagger stuff . they called it operation mongoose . the idea was to train all these cuban exiles for another invasion of cuba . banister s office was part of a supply line that ran from dallas , through new orleans to miami , stockpiling arms and explosives .
banister was running his camp north of lake pontchartrain . ferrie handled a lot of the training . there was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in cuba . a few americans got trained , too . nazi types . mercenaries . but ferrie was the craziest .
and oswald ?
anything more specific , jack ? it is important .
there was one guy , i do not know , big guy , business guy , white hair i saw him come into the office once . he looked out of place , y know like a society guy . cannot remember his name . oswald was with him .
bertrand . clay bertrand ?
yeah ! that is it . i do not know . maybe it was not . i gotta go .
clay bertrand . he is in the warren report . he tried to get oswald a lawyer . was kennedy ever discussed , jack ?
sure . course they hated the sonofabitch , but . . .
the assassination , jack ?
never . not with me sir , never . . . listen , i think i would better go . i said enough . i said all i am going to say .
hold on , jack . that is the problem ?
that is the problem ? that is the problem ? do i need to spell it out for you , mr . garrison ? i better go .
nobody knows what we are talking about , jack .
you are so naive , mister .
it is a contradiction , numa , get used to them . the only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets . or fake secrets .
even your own wife , numa . any of you want to quit , do me a favor . . . put us out of our misery .
you just need some sleep , lou . it will not look so bad when . . .
okay , you handle it , numa . i do not have time for this nonsense . we have obviously got the bastards worried now . i am going to washington .
she is the best damn witness we have !
i just do not want to do it . what else ?
i expected that two months ago , and they are wasting their time . . . the bad news is the national guard has just asked me to resign after years . well , maybe that is good news it was never as good as combat , but this is . bill , any more on oswald and shaw ?
he will never make it . if he wins , they will kill him . he wants to avenge his brother . he will stop that war . no , they will kill him before they let him become president .
then what are we going through all this trouble for ?
it is a means to an end . this war has two fronts in the court of law , we hope , against the odds , to nail clay shaw on a conspiracy charge . in the court of public opinion , it could take another or years for the truth to come out , but at least we are going to strike the first blow .
yes , thank you , mr . garrison . your coffee s almost turkish down here but i could get used to it .
yes , your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there .
i have done quite well in denver , mr . garrison , but i have to admire someone like you and i have the means to back up what i say .
we can use all the support we can get . i think these might interest you .
splendid , love to see them .
germany .
you were lucky . i spent three years in the pacific . i have never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail bonding companies . why is that ?
i imagine because this is the criminal district court building this is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence . we . . .
if you must know , virtually nothing .
how many men are working with you on this ?
less than you would guess . most days two to three assistant d . a . s . a handful of police investigators .
that is all you have had all this time ?
that is it .
the job manages to keep me pretty busy .
nonsense . you should be in a job where you can make decisions that have impact , affect the world . here you are trying to climb up the steep side of mount everest .
and what would i have to do ?
stop your investigation . . . it was a magnificent effort but it is over and done with . the press is already on your behind and that is only the beginning , my boy , only the beginning .
how long do you think it would take me to be appointed ?
yes ?
virginia or elizabeth ?
virginia .
virginia , you are a lucky little girl . your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest . would you like to be in a beauty contest ?
that sounds fun .
i need some information from you then . how old are you ?
six .
and how tall are you ?
yes .
do you walk home ?
uh huh .
mr . ruby , i really cannot see why you cannot tell us now .
i am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing i am going to have some lunch .
can i make a statement ? if you request me to go back to washington with you right now , that is if you want to hear further testimony from me , can you do that ? can you take me with you ?
no , that could not be done , mr . ruby . there are a good many things involved in that .
what are they ?
well , the public attention it would attract . and we have no place for you there to be safe , we are not law enforcement officials , and many things are at stake in this affair , mr . ruby .
but if i am eliminated there will not be any way of knowing . consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country , and i know i will not live to see you another time . my life is in danger here . do i sound screwy ?
well i do not know what can be done , mr . ruby , because i do not know what you anticipate we will encounter .
then you do not stand a chance , mr . chief justice , you have a lost cause . all i want is a lie detector test , and you refuse to give it to me . because as it stands now and the truth serum how do you pronounce it pentothal whatever it is . they will not give it to me , because i want to tell the truth . . . and then i want to leave this world .
yes , you have a suit i have had my eye on .
are you kidding , it looks great . you wear this to a business meeting , you are the badass in the room . but you can go out dancing in this too . it is a total power suit .
not a problem .
thanks .
oh , that is not a problem .
i went . i did . i took my mother and little brother .
but you did not ask permission . you broke a trust . if you had asked , karen probably would have let you . i am sure she would .
i know . that is why i went .
but then you told her you were home .
sure , cause i did not ask her if i could go .
i understand .
i mean it . i do not care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries .
then say yes , max . i understand .
yes , max , i understand .
i will call her .
will not forget ?
i will not forget .
who was there for your ass ?
you were there for me .
who ?
you .
i am still scared as a motherfucker , ordell . they talking like they serious about me doing that machine gun time .
naw , man . they just trying to put a fright in your ass .
if that is what they want to do , they are doing it .
how old is that machine gun shit ?
three years .
three years . that crime s old , man . they ai not got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killing people . how they gonna find room for you ?
that is not what they are telling me .
that is why they call it fucking with ya . now you wanna hear how we retaliate ?
naw , man . i gotta be someplace . i was kinda hopin you could come with me .
what would ya mean ?
look , i hate to be the kinda nigga , does a nigga a favor then bam hits a nigga up for a favor in return . but i am afraid i gotta be that kinda nigga .
what ?
i need a favor .
that requires me going out tonight ?
a bit .
aaaaawww man , i was not planning on going no place . it is twelve o clock , man . i am home , i am high
why the fuck you at home ? cause i spent ten thousand dollars gitting your ass home . look , i gotta problem . i need help , and you can help me .
well , it ai not so much a problem a a situation . remember i sold those three m machine guns outta the five i got ?
uh huh .
i am gonna sell the other two tonight . this group of koreans in koreatown have started a neighborhood watch kinda thing . and they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business . so i am gonna sell em my two machine guns tonight . only problem , i ai not never dealt with these koreans before . now i ai not worried . asians are by and large real dependable . they do not want no trouble . you might argue about price , but you ai not gotta worry about them shooting you in the back . but i got me kind of a rule . never do business with nobody you ai not never done business with before without backup . that is why i need you , backup .
man , i ai not ready to be going out nowhere
let me finish . can i finish ?
go ahead .
what the fuck i tell you . you do not hafta shoot nobody . just hold the gun . they will get the idea .
i ai not gitting in that trunk .
we are only going to koreatown . you will be in there ten minutes .
uh uh . i ai not riding in that trunk no minutes . why do not i just ride with you ?
you cannot ride with me . the surprise effect is ninety percent of it .
well , i am sorry , man , but i ai not gitting in that trunk .
i cannot believe you do me this way .
i ai not doing you no way . i just ai not climbing in that trunk . i got a problem with small places .
well , my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful , peanuthead niggas outta jail , but i do it
look , man , i know i owe you
well , if you owe me , git your ass in the trunk .
i wanna help you , but i do not wanna be locked in the trunk of no car .
you think i wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass ?
course you did not .
but the only way to help you was to do that , so i did it . okay , how about this ? after we are through fucking with these koreans , i take you to roscoe s chicken and waffles . my treat .
in his inside coat pocket .
i went to give him his refund , so he would not have to come here .
how would you know where he was ?
i found out .
and you did not tell the police ?
i told jackie , and jackie said you wanted him .
that looks like fifty thousand dollars from here .
can she afford a good one is the question . otherwise she will be in sybill brand three weeks easy before the public defender gets around to her .
ever heard of a fella named beaumont livingston ?
hey , jackie .
she wants to make a deal .
she sound scared ?
she almost sounds scared .
that is she want ?
she wants to go back to work .
that is she willing to give us ?
she has not one into specifics yet , she is been waiting for you .
she knows it is my case ?
she ai not said it , but she is not stupid , she knows it is you who wants her .
every step of this goes in my report . i am now taking a manila envelope from the subject s flight bag .
what time do you have to be there ?
sure .
the usual things . i am a flight attendant with cabo air .
this is special agent ray nicolet with alcohol , tobacco , and firearms . would you mind if we looked in that bag ?
you have the right to say no . and i have the right to make you wait here with ray while i go get a warrant . and if i do not want to go through all that trouble , i could just take you in on suspicion .
suspicion of what ?
if i were to tell you no it is not . . .
i am not saying another word .
arrest me .
oh , you are both ? in you were flying for twa and got busted for carrying drugs . you were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours . he did time and you got off . but that ended your career with the big airlines . cut to thirteen years later . you are forty four years of age . you are flying for the shittiest little shuttle fucking piece of shit mexican airline that there is . where you make a whopping twelve thousand dollars a year . that ai not a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career . and to top it off , you are going to jail . now true , the judge , even with your prior , will probably only give you a year or two . but this does not seem like the time of life you got years to throw away . now , we do not like trying losers like they are criminals . but in the absence of a criminal , we will try you . now , was not this money given to you by an american living in mexico by the name of cedric walker ?
while you are at it , let me see what else is in there . you mind ?
that is in it ?
beauty products .
that is my diet shit .
i am telling you , i do not know nothing about that fucking shit .
take your time .
thanks .
help you get ordell robbie .
course i do i deliver money for him .
can you do it or not ?
fine .
bet you are happy to be working again .
that is her name ?
he would not say . you gonna follow her ?
she leaves , somebody will be on her .
but you are not going to stop her ?
okay .
who do you think i am ?
can i see your i . d . ?
you are serious ?
in cash .
sure , ever been to the riverbottom ?
i do not think so .
it is okay . it is a cop hangout .
could not we just stop at a seven eleven ?
i thought you might want a drink ?
i would love one , but not there .
we could stop at the hilton by the airport .
is it dark ?
it is kind of a sports bar
that does not sound dark .
why does it need to be dark ?
cause i look like i just got outta jail , that is why . you dropping me off at home , right ? there s a place by me .
great .
ten pounds . i lose it and put it back on .
that is why i do not quit . if i cannot fly anymore , i am gonna have a bitch of a time getting my brand .
that is your brand ?
davidoffs . i get em in mexico . they are hard to find here . i was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for busting her boyfriend s head open with a baseball bat .
was she helpful ?
she was more helpful than the fucking public defender . i do not know i guess what i need is a lawyer , find out what my options are .
you know , i figured out the other day i have written something like fifteen thousand bonds since i have been in the business . i would say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related . if you want , i can help you look at your options .
i am , as a matter of fact .
so far i have been told i can cooperate and get probation , maybe . or , i can stand mute and get as much as five years . does that sound right ?
i would say if you are tried and found guilty you will not get more than a year and a day . that is state time . prison .
shit .
but they will not want to take you to trial . they will offer you simple possession , a few months of county time , and a year or two probation . how about another ?
sure .
yeah , but that is not what this was about . they were fuckin waiting for my ass . they knew i had that money , they even knew the amount . the one who searched my bag , from l . a . p . d . , dargus , hardly even looked at it . oh , i would say there s fifty thousand here . what would you say ? but all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to customs , and i could tell they did not want to do that .
they wanted you to tell them what you know .
i had em too . i burnt those two starky and hutch motherfuckers down . then their asses lucked out and found that coke .
what did they want to know ?
who gave me the money and who i was giving it to . and some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off . said it was him who told them about me .
that is him . how do you know em ?
i wrote him on monday . they found him dead on tuesday .
ordell pick up his bond ?
same as you . ten thousand .
the federal agent kinda half hinted ordell might of done beaumont .
you mentioned a guy from l . a . p . d . , but you did not mention the federal .
i did not ?
no , you did not . what branch ?
ray nicolet with alcohol , tobacco , and firearms .
it was the other guy who busted me .
cause if he busted you , you would play hell bonding out of federal court . he does not want you mad at him , he wants you to tell him what you know . he uses you to get a line on ordell , make a case , then take him federal . you know what ordell s into ?
i have a pretty good idea . ordell ai not no bootlegger and i doubt he is smuggling cuban cigars . so that only leaves one thing an a . t . f . man would be interested in .
how many trips did you make ?
with ten thousand ? nine .
he is got that kinda money ?
it is all in lock boxes in a mexico bank . but he is got a problem . he is what do you call it when you got money , but do not have cash ?
cash poor ?
that is it . he is cash poor . he kept on me till i finally said okay . i will bring whatever fits in a nine by twelve envelope . i got paid five hundred dollars , and his friend , mr . walker , in mexico gave me the envelope .
if you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law , why not pack a hundred grand ?
ask a . t . f . they might give you permission .
yeah , if i cooperate .
well , jackie , you got caught , you are gonna have to give em something .
but if all i can give em is ordell s name i do not really know shit about what he does or how he does it that do not give me much to bargain with .
give em what you got . offer to help . show a willingness to be helpful . you want to stay out of jail , do not you ?
i think maybe i have more options than i thought .
i am . have a seat .
i felt a lot safer having it . my milk went bad when i was in jail .
black s fine .
you went out this morning and bought a gun ?
you went out this morning and bought a gun .
yeah .
sure .
it looks nice .
i got a few . but i cannot afford to start all over again . i got too much time and money invested in my records .
uh huh .
who is this ?
the delfonics .
?
, i think .
it is nice .
are you ?
i do not know yet . i am going to talk with dargus and nicolet today . do what you suggested . offer to help and see what happens .
what i meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you .
i want to talk to them first . i know more now about ordell s money .
well , if the a . t . f . guy is the one who wants you , that will only interest him up to a point .
it is a lot of money . about a half a million dollars . all of it in cabo in safe deposit boxes and more coming in .
how would you find that out ?
he told me last night .
he called you ?
he came by .
what ? . . . what would you do ?
we talked .
why ?
he needs me . without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in cabo . sugar ?
no thanks . there s gotta be other ways to get it out .
same way i been doing , but first they got to let me go back to work .
you are gonna offer to set him up ?
if i get let off . otherwise , fuck em .
it is very possible ordell s killed somebody .
i ai not going to jail , and i ai not doing that probation thing again .
you are not old . you look great .
i am asking how you feel . does it bother you ?
it is not really something i think about .
really ?
okay , i am a little sensitive about my hair . it started falling out ten years ago . so i did something about it .
how would you feel about it ?
i am fine with it , or i would not of done it , i did it to feel better about myself , and i do . when i look in the mirror it looks like me .
it is different with men .
you know , i cannot really feel too sorry for you in that department .
bigger ?
yeah .
i just feel like i am always starting over . you said how many bonds you wrote ?
fifteen thousand .
well , i have flown seven million miles . and i have been waiting on people almost twenty years . the best job i could get after my bust was cabo air , which is about the worst job you can get in this industry . i make about sixteen thousand , with retirement benefits , ai not worth a damn . and now with this arrest hanging over my head , i am scared . if i lose my job i gotta start all over again , but i got nothing to start over with . i will be stuck with whatever i can get . and that scares me more than ordell .
surprise .
i know , ignoring me . what are you up to ?
catching a movie .
what would ya see ?
american president
how was it ?
pretty good . me and annette bening are goin steady .
oh , are you ? does she know that ?
no . . . . . . i do not believe she is ever heard of me . but that does not mean we are not going steady .
well , i would never be so bold as to speak for all men , but as or myself and a few of my friends , that is definitely the case . there s a lot of actresses out there you like , and there s some you have crushes on . but there s always one who you love . and with her it is sorta like going steady .
and annette s it for you ?
for now . these relationships never last too long .
sandra bullock . you know her ?
yeah , she is the girl who drove the bus in speed . she is cute .
she is adorable . but i had to end it .
why ?
i am old enough to be her father .
how old s annette ?
i do not care .
i go back to work tomorrow .
you talk them into it ?
they seem to like the idea .
bring the money in and they follow it ?
yea , but i am going to dress it up . put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone i meet here .
you do not actually do it that way ?
he always just picked it up at my place . but with a . t . f . involved , i want to stage it . you know , make it look more intriguing , like we know what the fuck we are doing . then it is up to ray nicolet , the a . t . f . guy to follow the shopping bag .
make the delivery somewhere in the mall .
right around here , in the food court .
sit down , leave the bag under the table ?
i am helping him bring his money into america . he loves the idea . you just missed him .
he was here ?
yeah , we were going over everything . that is why all the bags .
i called you last night .
i know , i got your message . ray wanted to have dinner . he wanted to talk about the sting we are plotting . that is what he calls it . a sting . he is being real nice to me .
you think he is got a thing for you ?
maybe . but i am thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself .
i do not follow your logic . what does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting ordell s money ?
he is setting me up to make a proposition .
i see .
you do not propose something like that unless you are pretty sure the other persongs into it .
has he hinted around ?
not really . but i knew this narcotics cop one time . told me that in a raid , the whole package never gets back to the station . his exact words .
you know some interesting people .
he were not bullshitting either , cause later he was suspended and forced to retire .
has nicolet told you any colorful stories like that ?
no harm in that . he is a young guy having fun being a cop . i know the type , trust me on this . he is more interested in ordell than the money . if he is gonna do anything suspect , it will be cutting corners to get the conviction but he would not walk off with the money . it is evidence .
what about you max ?
what ? if i was in nicolet s place ?
no , i mean you , right now . not it you were somebody else .
if i saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money , would i take it ?
you know where it came from . it is not like it is anybody s life savings . it would not even be missed .
a half a million dollars will always be missed .
you are avoiding the question .
okay , sure . i might be tempted . especially now , since i am getting out of the bail bonds business .
why ?
a lot of reasons . but the main one would be i am tired of it .
when did you decide ?
it is been a long time coming . i finally made up my mind i guess it was thursday .
the day you got me out of jail ?
yeah , that night i went to pick up a guy . i hear he is staying at this house , so i sneak in , wait for him to come home .
wait a minute . after we were together you went and snuck into a guy s house ?
uh huh .
and went to this guy s house in el monte , and i waited for him .
what do you do when he comes home ?
shoot him with the stun gun . while he is incapacitated , cuff him , take em to county .
you do that ?
that is my job .
did you do it that night ?
he never came home . but i am sitting on the couch , in the dark , holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew so after a couple hours i think , what am i doing here ? nineteen years of this shit ? so i made up my mind , that is it .
and is that it ?
more or less .
which one ?
if you had a chance , unemployed now , to walk off with a half million dollars , would you take it ?
i believe i said i would be tempted .
what if i have figured a way ?
it may be evidence once they get their hands on it , but right now it is only money .
that is what you do to go through with the shit you start . you rationalize . i can do this , max , i know i can . but i cannot do it without you .
do you think they bought it ?
oh , yeah . i got them thinking ordell s real nervous . they love thinking he is scared of them .
you know , a good cop will not let you know he knows you are fulla shit .
all he needed was a reasonable explanation .
do not be so literal . ray believed it .
but you still have to show him the money at the airport .
well , you know i am not going to show him the whole amount . he will see fifty thousand .
where is the rest of it ?
in the bag underneath .
what if he checks it ?
he will not i mean , he did not the last time . he will be expecting fifty thousand and there it is on top .
you are taking a helluva chance kid .
not really . if he finds it , i say mr . walker put the money in , and i did not know nothing about it . like the coke .
then you are out and you get nothing .
yeah , but i am not in jail and i tried .
you are gonna have surveillance all over you .
that is why you do not make a move till i come out of the fitting room .
in a dress .
well , a suit . there s one i had my eye on .
all winston had to do was ask around . ordell s living in long beach with a woman junkie .
how does winston find him if a . t . f . and all the local police cannot ?
people talk to winston . he is street , same as them , they trust him . they get busted , they know somebody who can bond them out . i thought i might drop in on him . he will no doubt be surprised to see me .
he is liable to shoot you .
on the phone i told him i have the ten thousand he put up for your bond . i could bring the money and the papers for him to sign . walk out and call the sheriff s department .
everybody wants him , he is a homicide suspect . it does not matter who brings him in , he is gonna name you as an accessory .
it is not that simple .
so how do we give ordell to nicolet ?
get ordell to come to your office .
set him up .
uh huh .
tell him you want to see him ?
tell him i want to give him his money .
why ?
i have chickened out . i am afraid of him . he will like that .
what do you tell nicolet ?
ordell called and wants to meet me and i am scared .
we get ordell to come to my office . nicolet is he already there , or does he come busting in while we are chatting ?
what if he hears something he is not supposed to ?
well , we do not let that happen , now do we ?
less ten percent .
yeah , your fee . i had to figure that out , since there was not no note .
i hesitated taking that much .
you worked for it if you are sure that is all you want .
i am sure .
that is he doing ?
he is on to a new thing . he is after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is woefully and wantonly selling assault rifles to minors . he says he is gonna take him down if it is the last thing he does .
did you tell him you were leaving ?
i told him i might .
they have confiscated all his other stuff . but this one s sorta left over . the registrationgs in the glove box , the keys were under the seat . . . that is a matter , have not you ever borrowed someone s car ?
not after they are dead .
i did not say you did .
i never lied to you .
i know .
we are partners .
i am fifty five years old . i cannot blame anybody for anything i do .
do you blame yourself for helping me ?
you will get over that .
spain .
madrid or barcelona ?
start off in madrid . ever been there ?
thanks , but you have a good time .
sure i cannot twist your arm ?
thank you for saying that , but no . my business .
i thought you were tired of your business ?
i am just tired in general .
are you scared of me ?
well , that is the state s offer . if you plead to possession and tell l . a . p . d . what they want to know , your bond will be set at one thousand dollars . if you do not , l . a . p . d . will request one at twenty five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight . if you do not post it or do not know anyone who can , you will spend six to eight weeks in county before your arraignment comes up .
who s side are you on ?
i beg your pardon ?
what if i plead guilty ?
and cooperate ? you might get probation .
if i do not cooperate ?
with the prior ? you could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge . you want to think about it ? you got two minutes before we are up .
do you live together ?
not every day ?
then you do not see him for a few days ?
you know that is in the bag you are taking ?
he say is a surprise .
well , sheronda , it was nice talking to you .
yeah ?
what the fuck is that shit ?
i know what it looks like .
you planted that shit on me .
it is not enough for trafficking , but how about posession with the intent to distribute ?
can i smoke ?
i need permission to leave the country so i keep my job .
we can look into that .
i need it tomorrow . if i do not show up for work tomorrow , i am fired .
you know what we want .
if i am working , i can help you .
you never asked me if i did or not .
he sells guns .
you ever see him sell guns ?
no .
then how do you know he sells guns ?
he told me . besides , why else would an a . t . f . man be after him ?
how can you help us ?
short of wearing a wire , i will do everything i can to help you throw his ass in jail . and in exchange for my help , i need permission to leave the country and immunity .
what are you doing ?
i thought you were going to let this one through .
a broadway shopping bag .
you two meet ?
this afternoon before i came here . he was with ordell at an apartment in hermosa beach . i do not know if he lives there , but i can find out .
you talk to him ?
not really .
his full name is louis gara . he just got out from serving four years in susanville .
what for ?
bank robbery ? do you know what he does for ordell ?
i imagine shit needs to be done .
we have been following mr . gara , and he is definitely working for ordell .
ever meet her , or they talk about her ?
not yet .
who s the other one ?
white girl named melanie ralston . another girlfriend of ordell s .
that is her story ?
it was her coke i got busted with . she knows everything , but she is not part of it , and she is pissed cause she is not part of it . ordell would not even let her stay at the meeting . she tried to talk me into ripping off ordell .
and splitting with her ?
i am sure that was the idea .
what did you say ?
i smiled and walked away . she also told me ordell killed beaumont .
she told you that ?
uh huh .
was she there ?
she did not say .
but she mentioned beaumont by name ?
uh huh .
well , this sounds like a lady i would like to have a word with . so everything s set for tomorrow ?
right . everything s the same , except one change . . .
well , it is true , is not it ? after this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else . what do you think ?
we could , if i am not in jail .
oh , that is taken care of . i called the state attorney s office . you were no filed this morning in circuit court .
i was told ten thousand in each pack .
you did not count it ?
i never have . it is not my money .
what ? to put one of these in my pocket ?
uh huh .
if i did , i would have to give you one , would not i ? or we could take what we want . no one knows how much there is except us , right ?
yes . all those things are true .
after all , it do not belong to nobody , right ?
that would be one point of view .
yeah , well , it is not a point of view that a . t . f . shares . once we make it evidence , it belongs to us . you are now officially out of trouble . do not do nothing stupid , now .
how can i do anything if i am being watched every second ?
i am glad you realize that . saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you . put this in your shopping bag . it is what i expect to find when i look in sheronda s . comprende ?
si .
you did not . i would think with all this on your mind , you would wait till after .
i got there early . i have had my eye on this suit wait , let s start over . i got there early . the idea was to try on the suit , see if i liked it . if i did , get them to wrap it up , and change back into my uniform . that is what sheronda s expecting me to wear . go meet sheronda , give her the bag with fifty thousand , and go home .
but you did not do that .
because i did not have it . ray , i swear , melanie came in and grabbed it . and someone killed her for it .
she did not give me one . i told you before , melanie was not part of the plan . ordell must of told her to do it . she bursts in , grabs the shopping bag , and takes off . what am i supposed to do , go after her ? i am in my fucking underwear . i had to get dressed before i could do anything . so i put this back on cause could put this on faster than i could my uniform .
you took the time to pay the saleswoman .
i had to . i was frantic . i did not know what to do .
what did you do after that ?
i went looking for you . i went straight to the bookstore , cause that is where you were last time , but you were not there . how the hell else am i supposed to let anybody know what happened ? you did not tell me how to do that , did you ? i knew i was under surveillance , so when i could not spot anybody , i started yelling .
there was a guy with melanie ?
not in the fitting room .
this guy with melanie , that was louis gara ?
i did not see him . i was in my underwear . if it was a white guy , it was probably louis . he kill melanie ?
it is possible . you are saying you do not have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand ?
i have no idea .
you would take a polygraph on it ?
if it will make you happy .
i sure hope you have not done anything dumb jackie .
i thought you were watching him .
we were , and we lost him . he walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out . the bar was on ninth , less than a mile and a half from where louis was found dead . it looks like louis s friend shot him twice at point blank range .
so what happens now ?
we pick up ordell . we have got three murders we can link him to . we have the storage unit where he keeps his guns , by tomorrow we will have a search warrant to go in and get him . and we have you .
what about me ?
what about you ?
do you think i took some of that money ?
i have no evidence of your taking anything . you did not pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills i was glad to see that . you have been helping us out , you gave us melanie and louis . melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her , which goes a long way backing up your story .
buy ya a beer ?
i am waiting for the phone .
good luck . that guy s been in there since i got here .
well , i guess i better look for another one , then . thanks , anyway .
great . . . . . . wanda !
better get me another sam s . join me in a jaeger shot ?
uh uh .
gimme one anyway .
this time ? almost a year . i have known him forever .
what were you two fighting about ?
he told me to go outside . you may leave us now . it is all part of his pathetic attempt to be the man . you know mr . walker do not you ?
that coke was yours , was not it ?
you believe that ? yeah , well , i guess you have to trust him . i would have second thoughts on that , but then i know em .
beaumont livingston ?
you already knew that ?
kinda .
so tell me . having all that money in your flight bag is it tempting ?
dreaming .
you know how easy it would be ? he will not be anywhere near that mall . pull one more switch , up front . that is it . half a million dollars . need help ?
keep it between us girls ?
that is that fucker ever done for us ?
i do not think so , but thanks for the beer .
hi , melanie .
are you getting that black suit ?
yeah , do you like it ?
it looks good on you .
do you got something for me ?
you betcha .
thanks .
now be careful with that bag . you do not want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store .
i was expecting you . come in .
got some o . j . ?
yeah .
sure .
who you think got your ass outta jail ?
hey , you get caught with blow , that is your business .
they asked .
and what was your answer ?
i said i wanted to talk to a lawyer .
you positive about that ? you were not nervous and let something slip by mistake ? if you did , i ai not mad , i just gotta know .
i knew it .
and they asked if i knew mr . walker .
i did not tell em anything .
they told me .
i think it is a gun pressing against my dick .
you thought right . . . now take your hands from around my throat , nigga .
shut your ass up and grab the wall !
the cops did not try and strangle my ass .
damn , jackie , i was just playing with you .
well , i ai not playin with you . i am gonna unload both these motherfuckers , you do not do what i tell you . understand what i am saying ?
baby , i ai not come here she shoves both guns in ordell s back .
i said , you understand what i am saying
i understand woman , damn !
go sit over in that chair .
shut your raggedy ass up and sit down .
way i see it , me and you only got one thing to talk about . what you willing to do for me ?
baby , i did not
it is okay . i forgive you . now , let s say if i tell on you , i walk . and if i do not , i go to jail .
one hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name , if i am convicted up to a year , or put on probation . if i have to do more than a year , you pay another hundred thousand .
all your money s in mexico .
i been thinkin about that , too , and i got me a idea .
talk to you tomorrow .
the cockatoo inn ? where is that ?
it is right on hawthorne boulevard and manhattan beach boulevard . it is red brick . . .
oh , wait , you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it ?
it is a cockatoo .
i do okay .
you a fine looking woman , jackie . i bet you do a damn sight better than okay . you think anybody followed you ?
i do not think so , but it do not really matter . they know i am meeting you .
how the fuck they know that ?
i told them .
they already know it is you .
well , shit . that do not mean you gotta confirm it !
look , the only way i can get permission to fly is if i agree to help them . which is what i have to appear to be doing . so i give them something they already know . you .
didja tell em anything else ?
i told them you got a half a million dollars in mexico , and you want me to bring it here .
it is true , is not it ?
what the fuck s that got to do with it ?
they know i am delivering for you . i mention the half million they do not give a fuck about that they want you with guns . so i say , well , if you want proof he is getting paid for selling them , let me bring the money in .
what did they say ?
naw , naw , that is too much exposure . i ai not goin anywhere near that money .
you do not have to . i told em you are real careful . you never pick up money yourself . you always send someone , and i never know who it is .
that is a good idea .
if you just listen , you will see it is a damn good idea . the first time i do it they are lurking about . they see me hand the ten thousand to someone .
who ?
i do not know . one of your friends .
a woman .
if you want .
yeah , i think a woman .
the next trip , when i come with all the money , it will look like i hand it to the same one i did before . . .
but you do not ?
no , i give it to someone else first .
and they follow the wrong one thinking she is bringing it to me .
that is the idea .
so we need two people , two women .
can you cover that ?
i got the woman covered . where you thinking about doing this ?
i was thinking the del amo mall . in the food court .
i suppose you see a piece of this for yourself ?
well , it is my plan . we are in this together .
yeah , but it is my money , and i do not need me a partner .
i ai not your partner , i am your manager . i am managing to get your money out of mexico , into america , in your hands , and i am managing to do all this under the nose of the cops . that makes me your manager , and managers get fifteen percent .
managers get ten percent .
that is an agent . manager s get fifteen percent .
i will give ya ten .
plus the same deal as before .
i can do that .
uh huh .
who ?
what would you care ?
look , it is my ass facing the penitentiary . you send some hard headed roc whore , and she fucks things up .
i ai not gonna send no roc whore . the womangs cool , i promise .
i need to talk to you alone .
what the hell you talking bout ?
sheronda passing the money onto someone else , that is what the hell i am talking about .
how do you know she did that ?
i was there , i saw her do it .
well , you were not supposed to be there .
i know , but i hung around , cause i figured you would try ang pull some shit like this .
now , hold on there . i ai not pulling no shit . it is my money , i can do whatever the fuck i wanna do with it .
not when it is my ass on the line you do not . we do this my way or fuck it .
man , i do not like that part .
it washes off . i tell them we are doing it the same way as before . they will follow sheronda . i hate the idea of leaving her for a fall .
she will not have no problems cause she do not know nothing .
are you sure she do not know about the money ?
she do not know shit about the money .
what does she think she is gettin ?
i told her this is a game us rich folks play , exchanging gifts . like a scavenger hunt . she did not know what that was neither . no answer ?
right , the one simone gives me . simone and i will make the switch at robinsongs may . she knows what i look like ?
she saw you with sheronda . so simone goes to the dress department with her robinsongs may bag .
designer clothes .
she waits for you to go in the place where you try things on .
the fitting room . there s a sign over the door .
where you gonna be during all this ?
i am gonna be sitting at the titty bar in downtown l . a . till my man over here calls me and gives me the o . k . sign .
ray , the a . t . f . guy .
that works on my nerves , you being so buddy buddy with him .
if i was not , this would not work . now once i deliver i will have to trust you .
well , i have been trusting you all this time , have not i ? we agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that is what you gonna get .
we are partners , baby , sorta . i ai not gonna screw you . you have not told me where i put it for you .
max cherry ? you and him friends now ? you tell him about this shit ?
he will not know where the money came from . only that it is money .
i can sit through it once .
he thinks he is joe gunn now .
i am impressed . he knows a lot .
he is just repeating shit he overheard . he ai not any more a gun expert than i am .
sure .
four days ago .
where at ?
susanville .
how long ?
two months shy of four years .
four years ?
uh huh .
what for ?
bank robbery .
really , i am impressed .
yeah , there s another hit left .
yeah , i am just getting old . i cannot smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing .
coughing opens up the capillaries . when you cough , you are getting air in this case smoke to parts of the lung that do not normally get used . coughing s good gets ya higher . my dad coughs when he smokes all the time .
that is a metrix ?
it is a diet thing ?
no , it is what body builders drink to beef up .
no thanks .
the roller disco one .
fourteen .
yeah .
i thought you were sixteen .
i was pretty much the same height now as i was then .
were you a disco girl ?
noooo , i was a surfer girl . besides , i was only fourteen . i could not go to discos .
so where did you go ?
the beach . or get high , drop acid at a friend s place . i was a k . l . o . s . girl . i hated disco .
no .
where were you ?
detroit .
with ordell ?
we had done time together already .
no .
c mon , do not lie .
i do not like dancing .
did you ever go i one ?
i went to a few just to meet women . but i do not like to dance , and it is so fuckin loud . during that whole scene i just drank in bars . who did not make the cut ?
that is a picture of me in japan .
you been to japan ?
i lived there for about nine months .
you lived in japan , when ?
about five years ago .
who s arm is that ?
that is the guy i lived with . . . his name was . . . hirosh .
must of made quite an impression .
i never got to know him , really . i could not speak japanese , and his english was terrible . but i could not say anything , because his english was better than my japanese .
that sounds like a problem .
not really . we did not have much to say to each other anyway . i never got to know him that well , but i knew enough to know i was not missing much . i keep that , because of all the fucking time i was there , that is the only picture i got of me in japan . that is japan .
sure .
now that is over , let s get to know each other .
yeah .
i would not go so far as to say that .
so what are you trying to tell me ? i should get out of here ?
no .
he went to meet that stewardess .
does that bother you ?
you live with him .
i live here . he drops in and out . he tell you about that half million dollars he is got in mexico ?
uh huh ?
course he did , he tells everybody who will listen . that is what he is doing with this stewardess . he is scheming how he can get it over here .
and your point is ?
let him and that stewardess get that money over here . . .
uh huh ?
. . . and just take it from him .
all right already .
we shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it had not been for your fucking around !

i have not even looked at it yet , it is still in the shopping bag .
melanie must be dying to see it . louis .
that is what i got to talk to you about . you see , melanie was giving me a hard time
not now , pick me up .
that is what i gotta tell you . she bugged me the whole time . got pissy with me cause i would not let her carry the bag . started running her fucking mouth . . . i could not remember right away when we came out where the car was parked , so she got on me about that . is it this aisle lou is , is it that one ? she was totally fucking with my nerves .
so what , you left her there .
i shot her .
twice . in the parking lot .
could not talk to her ?
you know how she is .
you could not just hit her ?
maybe . . . but at that moment . . . i dunno . . .
you shot her twice ?
uh huh .
so you are sure she is dead .
pretty sure .
where did you shoot her ?
in the chest and stomach .
well , if you had to do it , you had to do it . what we do not want is that bitch surviving on us . anybody but that woman .
what ?
where is the rest of it ?
how much it there ?
maybe forty , maybe not that much .
you said five hundred and fifty !
so you light , ai not you . you light about a half a million .
look , that is the bag she came out with . she never even put her hand in it , and neither did i .
came outta where ?
the fitting room . it went down exactly the way it was supposed to .
how long was she in there ?
maybe a minute . she came right out .
louis , you telling me the truth ?
look , i swear to fucking god , she came out with that bag and i took it from her .
then what ?
we went to the parking lot .
where you shot her .
that is right .
you sure she ai not somewhere with a half a million dollars i worked my ass off to earn ?
fuck you for asking me that .
pull the car over .
it is in there .
if she is got it , why did not she take it all ?
fore i blow that bitch s brains out , i will ask her .
maybe the feds got it .
if there were nothin in here but towels , maybe she did not get a chance to take it from her suitcase and a . t . f . got it . but , she put these fucking books in here to trick our ass .
that is why i never checked it . the bag felt right .
then she throws forty thousand in here , to rub the shit in my face , know what i am saying ? she wants me to know she ripped me off .
i do not know . either she has it or the feds .
or . . . . . . she gave it to somebody else first , before melanie went in the dressing room .
what ?
you know who i saw in the dress department ?
tell me .
i did not really think anything of it . no i did wonder what he was doing there , but did not think it had anything to do with us . you know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend .
you gonna tell me who it was ?
max cherry .
do max cherry and jackie brown know each other ?
hell , yes , they know each other . he bonded her out of county .
how am i supposed to know that ?
you know the motherfucker s a bail bondsman , do not ya ? you know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell ?
why should i think anything s weird , if i do not know nothing about them knowing each other ?
man , i do not want to hear your fucking excuses !
oh , you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money i got in the world ! let me tell you the reason , motherfucker ! the reason is , your ass ai not worth a shit no more !

cops cannot locate him , huh ?
they do not have your winning personality .
sure thing . i do not have to know what i am doing , long as you know .
i think i do . is that good enough ?
where would you like me to put my ash ?
he is a big one . you two tight ?
yeah .
it was our idea to take the picture , was not it ?
gonna have to put up cash .
you have it with you ?
you have cash . what do you need me for ?
c mon , you know how they do . black man comes in with ten thousand , they wanna fuck with em . first off , they gonna wanna know where i got it . second , they gonna keep a big chunk of it start talking that court cost shit . fuck that shit , jack . i will go through you .
cost you a thousand for the bond .
i know that .
fella named beaumont . they have him up at county . it started out drunk driving , but they wrote it up possession of a concealed weapon . dumb monkey ass had a pistol on him .
ten thousand sounds high .
they ran his name and got a hit . he is been in before .
you think you could do that ?
beaumont . that is the only name i know .
you go wait in the car . wait a minute .
livingston , huh ?
on his prior , he served nine months , and he is working on four years probation .
you do not say .
do you know what he is on probation for ?
have not a clue .
possession of unregistered machine guns .
will they consider this a violation of his probation ?
they do consider this a violation of his probation . your boy s looking at ten years , plus the concealed weapon .
man , he will not like that . beaumont do not got a doing time disposition .
i need your name and address .
ordell robbie . o r d e l l . r o b b i e . florence boulevard . compton .
house or apartment ?
house .
now i need you to count your money .
beaumont ai not going nowhere . where do i sign ?
yes .
i was wondering . what if before the court date gets here , beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies . i get my money back , do not i ?
the door was opened , so i just came right in .
i can see that . why ?
i got some more business for ya .
oh , yeah ? what did he do ?
she is an airline stewardess . got caught coming back from mexico with some blow . they set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand . now , what i was thinking , you could use the ten thousand you owe me from beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess .
the bond for possession is only a thousand .
they fucking wit her . they calling it possession with intent . a black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her , they call that shit intent . same shit happened to a movie star . it is possession .
it still sounds high .
she had , i believe it was . . . fifty grand on her , too . there was a cop at the hearing . young guy with l . a . p . d . wanted her bond set at twenty five thousand , saying there was a risk of flight . jackie being a stewardess and all .
before we start talking about stewardess , let s get beaumont out of the way first .
what ?
you did not hear ?
hear what ?
somebody with a grudge blew beaumont s brains out hey , that rhymes blew beaumont s brains out .
did the police contact you ?
very first motherfucking thing they did . they see i put up a big money bond on my boy , they start thinking with that where there s smoke there s fire logic . they roust my ass outta bed , ten o clock in the morning . fucking scare my woman , sherona , half to death . she thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure .
the stewardess . do you know her last name ?
brown , jackie brown .
what does she do for you ?
who says she does anything for me ? she is my friend . when my friends get into trouble , i like to help em out .
beaumont worked for you .
that is what the police thought . i told them i am unemployed , how could i have anybody work for me ? now i bail out jackie , i am liable to have the police on me again , huh ? wanting to know was she doing things for me , was she bringing me that money !
was she ?
is this , me and you , like a lawyer client relationship ? the lawyer cannot tell nothing he hears ?
you are not my client until you get busted and i bond you out .
if there s no what do you call it confidentiality between us ? why would i tell you anything ?
cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are . you got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand .
why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand ?
you want me to speculate on what you do . i would say you are in the drug business , except the money s moving in the wrong direction . whatever you are into , you seem to be getting away with it , so more power to you . okay you want another bond , and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on beaumont to the stewardess . that means paperwork . i have to get a death certificate , present it to the court , fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral , then type up another application . an indemnity agreement
jackie ai not got time for all that shit
i am telling you what i have to do . what you have to do , in case you forgot , is come up with premium of a thousand bucks .
i got it . i just do not got it on me .
well , come back when you do , and i will bond out the stewardess .
man , you know i am good for it . thousand bucks ai not shit .
if i do not see it in front of me , you are right . it ai not shit .
man , you need to look at this with a little compassion . jackie ai not no criminal . she ai not used to this kinda treatment . i mean , gangsters do not give a fuck but for the average citizen , coupla nights in county fuck with your mind .
ordell , this is not a bar , an you do not have a tab .
just listen for a second . we got a forty year old , gainfully employed black woman , falsely accused
falsely accused ? she did not come back from mexico with cocaine on her ?
falsely accused of intent . if she had that shit and mind you , i said if it was just her shit to get high with .
is white guilt supposed to make me forget i am running a business ?
is that what i think it is ?
i think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older .
mister robbie , is not it ? i have the ten thousand you put up . is not that why you called .
she got off , huh ?
they decided to no file . tell me where you are and i will bring you your money .
looky here , i know you helped her and i know you know what i want . jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers . long as at the end of that story , she hands over my money . she do that , we are still friends . now , she do not wanna be my friend no more , tell her to think about ol louis . and if she tries to turn me in , i will name her ass as my accessory . we will go upstate together . hand in handcuffed hand . now that shit is a promise , understand what i am saying ? you tell her that , and i will call you back .
i thought you might be asleep .
you keep fucking with me , you are gonna be asleep forever .
git your ass in here .
i have a bond receipt for you to sign .
you know what the fuck i am talking about . you talk to her ?
she wants to give you your money . if she did not , there would be cops batter ramming the door right now .
how would you find me ?
winston found you .
how the fuck did he find me ?
that is what winston does . he finds people who do not want to be found .
well , bully for that nigga . you say she wants to give me the money , huh ?
uh huh .
well , give it to me then .
she wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent . she also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it .
i would like to hear that too . turn around and put your hands on your head .
lift up your pant leg . you help her ?
all i did was walk out with it .
and you did that to protect my interest ?
in a way , yes .
my ass be dumb , but i am not a dumbass . go sit over there on the couch .
you get used to it after a while . now tell me where my money s at .
my office .
and where is jackie ?
she is been there since thursday night .
she wanted to see me , why was not she home ?
she was afraid .
that i gotta see .
she still is . she does not want to get shot before she can tell you what happened .
have her bring the money here .
it is in the safe . she cannot get at it .
call her , tell her the combination .
i am telling you , you got her spooked . she will not leave there till you have your money and you are gone .
you expect me to just walk in there ?
if she wanted to set you up , you would be in custody right now . when you said you would name her as an accessory she believed you . that scares her more than anything .
that is why she is giving up my money huh ? not that bullshit about melanie . i did not trust her ass neither , but i knew how to handle her . she was my blonde headed little surfer gal . i fucking told louis he could have just given her a punch in the mouth , he did not need to shoot her . she is at your office .
uh huh .
by herself . that big mandingo nigga winston ai not there , is he ?
she is all alone .
i call your office , she better answer the phone .
she will .
i know where it is .
turn left .
i know where to turn .
uh huh .
she starts giving me some bullshit about it ai not there . it is somewhere else and we can go get it . i am shooting you in the head right then and there . then i am gonna shoot her in the kneecap , find out where my godamn money is . i go walking in there and that nigga winston or anybody else is in there , you are the first man shot , understand what i am saying ?
yeah .
now , is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car ?
no .
you sure ?
yes .
you better be , motherfucker .
you know it is for you .
it is beaumont .

he was upset . he thought people were following him .
frank . it is jake . jacob singer .
that is right . we did .
what does that mean , frank ? i do not get it . why ?
it is hard to explain .
well , try , huh .
i do not know if i can . it is just that war is war . things happen .
things happen ? what the fuck are you talking about ? they did something to us , frank . we have to expose this .
there s nothing to expose .
jesus christ ! who s been talking to you ? that is going on ? how can you just turn away ? what about the others ?
they are not interested , jake .
shit ! you know it is not half the case if i go it alone . we are all suffering the same symptoms , frank . the army is to blame . they have done something to us . how can you not want to know ?
maybe it is not the army , jake .
what do you mean ?
maybe there s a larger truth .
what are you talking about ?
maybe the demons are real .
goddamn it . what kind of bullshit is that ?
listen , jake . i gotta go .
what the hell ? what kind of mumbo jumbo . . . ?
i am hanging up .
hey , wait !
do not bother to call again , okay ?
gabe ? what are you doing . . . ?
there was a bang .
it was the window .
it is cold .
tell your mother .
mom , it is . . .
now what ?
do not go .
do not go ? i am not going anywhere . i am right here , gabe . come on , go back to sleep . you can still get a couple of hours .
this is not injustice , mr . geary . the army did something to us and we have got to find out what .
the army . the army . what is it with you guys ? we are not talking about a trip to the library here . this is the united states government for god s sake . this is red tape coming out of your ass . you know what i mean ?
exactly . and we need someone to cut through it . we hear you are the man .
oh yeah ? what am i perry mason here ?
ah ! i thought you were a mailman .
i am .
then why are not you teaching ? why are not you in a university ?
i am too messed up to teach .
ah ! well then , they are going to have to pay for that , are not they ?
nobody s been talking to nobody . you do not have a case , you hear me ? it is pure and simple . now leave me alone . okay ?
you need . . . a doctor .
a doctor ? and that is he gonna do , tell me i am crazy ? they have fucked with my head . i have got to prove it . you have got to do something .
something s going on here . you are not telling me something . what the hell s gotten into you ?
i will tell you that is gotten into me . i do not know you from adam , right ? you come to my office with this bizarro story and demand i look into it . okay . i said i would check it out and i did . now i do not know what kind of fool you take me for , but you have used and abused me , and i do not like it .
used you ?
i talked to the army s bureau of records . you have never even been to viet nam .
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
it means that you and your buddies are whacko , that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in thailand .
war games ? thailand ? that is not true ! how can you believe that ? cannot you see what they are doing ? it is all a lie . we were in da nang , for god s sake . you have got to believe me .
i do not have to do any such thing . i am eating my lunch , okay ?
why do you say that ?
cars do not explode that way . any simpleton knows that .
but the paper . . .
that was set . i am telling you .
what else did he say , jake ?
he told me he was going to hell .
how long had that been going on ?
a couple of weeks , i think .
no . not really . . .
excuse me a minute . i will be right back .
i think something s fucking connect ed . i mean , a car tried to run me over the other day . doug too , right ? we have got six guys here going fucking crazy .
. . . i have seen them , too .
shit !
an explosion , just like paul s .
okay , not you rod . but the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason . they are trying to kill us . fuck it man , we need to find out that is going on .
maybe that is the only way to get through . besides , six heads will be better than one .
not my head , buddy . not me . i am getting a headache just listening to you .
we should get ourselves a lawyer .
i say you should get a shrink .
how do you know ?
i know you . how come you are so tense today ?
what can i tell you ?
i saw sarah the other day .
her knee acting up ?
a bit .
what did she have to say ?
turn on your right side . how about the other right ? i do not understand you philosphers . you have got the whole world figured out but you cannot remember the difference between right and left .
i was absent the day they taught that in school . what did she say ?
who ?
sarah .
not much . she is like you that way . two clams . no wonder your marriage did not last . put your hand under your head . take a breath and then let it out .
she talk about the boys ?
she says she cannot get them new coats because you have not sent the alimony for three months .
she told you that ? did she tell you about the , i am still paying for the orthodontist ? i will bet she did not mention that .
she said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you .
i thought you said she did not say much .
she did not . that is about all she said . put your hand up . good . i think she still loves you . take a breath and let it out .
right . she does not stop talking about you . you are always on her mind . that is love , jake .
she hates me , louis .
you should go back to her .
what ? she threw me out , remember . she wanted some professor to carry her far away from brooklyn . only we did not make it . she cannot forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in .
her problem is that you spent eight years getting a phd and then went to work for the post office .
what can i tell you , louis ? after nam i did not want to think anymore . i decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos .
if it was any other brain but yours , i might agree . relax , this is going to be strong .
i cannot relax .
wiggle your toes .
i had to get in there . a deep adjustment . rest a moment and let it set a bit .
i had this weird flash just then .
what ?
i do not know . i have been having them recently . you know , you look like an angel , louis , an overgrown cherub . anyone ever tell you that ?
yeah . you . every time i see you . no more errol flynn , okay ? your back will not take it . you tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows that is good for you .
louis , you are a life saver .
i know .
am i dead , louis ? am i dead ?
from a slipped disc ? that would be a first .
i was in hell . i have been there . it is horrible . i do not want to die , louis .
well , i will see what i can do about it .
i have seen it . it is all pain .
you ever read meister eckart ? how did you ever get your doctorate without reading eckart ? good . okay , let s turn over gently . right side .
what ? by myself ?
you can do it . come on . easy . just give it a try .
there s something i have gotta take care of , louis .
what are you talking about ? you can barely stand .
i am walking , are not i ?
jake , you need to rest .
not tonight , louis . no more rest .
the postal service . i am a mailman .
ah . neither snow nor sleet , nor dark of night . . . i always admired that .
it is good to see you .
likewise .
i have not seen her in months .
ah !
i am with another woman now . we are both with the post office , midtown , th street branch .
hmm . i do not suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office ?
oh , you would be surprised . they just do not have their doctorates , that is all .
last i heard you were offered a posi tion in the west somewhere . tuscon was it ?
oh , that goes way back . they had a hiring freeze , one of those last min ute things . bad timing for me though . middle of the war . the draft . i will tell you prof , after viet nam . . . i did not want to think anymore . i decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos .
jacob , if it was any other brain but yours , i might agree . tell me , does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker , what a sub lime intellect she is living with ?
i doubt it is my mind that interests her . i tell you prof , she is a fiery lady .
well , try not to get burned . you have a great mind , jacob . do not let anyone tempt you away from it .
demons , jacob ? why demons ? are you writing . . . ?
no . i see them .
see them ? what do you mean ? physically ?
yes .
i see them , prof . everywhere . they are invading my life .
have you considered a doctor ? a psy chiatrist ?
yes . i do not want them . i am not looking for analysis or drugs . it is too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis . it is more than that . i can feel it . i need you prof . you are the only one i can talk to .
i do not know what to say .
i need your insight , your intuition .
i am afraid , prof . nothing makes sense . please help me .
jacob , i do not believe in demons , not in the empirical sense . i do not be lieve in devils fighting for our souls . i do not believe in enternal damnation . i do not believe in other worldly creatures tormenting us . we do not need them . we do a good enough job on ourselves .
but i see them .
look . i do not pretend to know that is going on inside your head . for all i know it is pathological and they should be pumping valium into your veins by the quart . but if you are not willing to accept the help of sci ence and believe me , i admire you for that then you will have to do bat tle on your own . what can i say ? it is a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls . but to be pursued by . . . demons no less . . . there are no guides , jacob . you wanna know what i would do if i sud denly started seeing demons ? i would hail the first taxi that came along , shoot over to bellvue and beg them for shock treatment . i am no saint .
hell , you think i am ?
i havenever understood you , you know that ? you were by far the best pupil i have ever had , bar none . intellectu ally , you were the most original , the most imaginative . who knows , maybe you have been elected to see demons . maybe you are in touch with . . . some thing . nothing would surprise me about you jacob . nothing .
carlson ? is he new here ?
new ? he is been here for years .
look , i need to see him . i know where his room is . just give me a pass . i will not be long . ten minutes .
our doctors are seen by appointment only .
damn it . i was in the veterangs out patient program . he knows me .
that is your name ?
jacob singer .
whataya mean , no record ?
you want me to spell it out ? there s nothing here .
that is ridiculous . i have been coming here for years . listen to me . i am going out of my fucking mind here . i need to see him .
if this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers . there s about an hour s wait . i will be glad to take your name . why do not you just fill out this form ?
goddamn it ! i do not want a social worker . carlson knows me .
it is freezing .
i am not cold .
of course not . you have all the blankets . it must be ten degrees in here . i am telling you , sarah , if you want to sleep with fresh air , you sleep on the fire escape . from now on that window is closed .
it is not healthy with it closed .
this is healthy ? i will probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy .
i do not want to know .
jezebel , from the post office . you remember , you met her that time at the christmas party . i was living with her . god , it was a nightmare . there were all these demons and i was on fire . only i was burning from ice .
guilty thoughts . see what happens when you cheat on me , even in your mind ?
she was good in bed , though .
go to sleep .
she had these real beefy thighs . delicious .
i thought you said it was a nightmare ?
no . of course you are not . you have just hurt your back . that is all . you are going to be fine . it will just take some time .
save me !
your back ? did you fall ?
who did ?
i do not know . santa claus . i had my songs picture in it . gabe s picture . it is the only one i had .
we better get an orthopedic man in here . is dr . davis on call ?

jezzie , i cannot see .
maybe you left em in the bathroom .
your kid dropped it off .
who ? jed ?
no . the little one .
eli . why cannot you remember their names ?
they are weird names .
they are biblical . they were prophets .
well , personally , i never went for church names .
and where do you think jezebel comes from ?
i do not let anybody call me that .
you are a real heathen , you know that , jezzie ? jesus , how did i ever get involved with such a ninny ?
you sold your soul , remember ? that is what you told me .
yeah , but for what ?
a good lay .
and look what i got .
the best .
i must have been out of my head .
jake , you are never out of your head !
that is in here ?
pictures . your wife was gonna toss em so that is his name brought em over on his way to school .

gabe .
i do not like things that make you cry .

i do not know . one of these days , i am gonna see louis . my back s killing me .
now ? what about the boss ? he is not gonna like it .
i will be glad to avoid the crush .
i enjoy crushing into you .
why do you bring her up ?
cause she is always on your mind .
when was the last time i said a word ?
it has nothing to do with talking .
what does that have to do with anything ? does it explain the barricaded subway stations ? does it explain those godforsaken creatures ?
new york is filled with creatures . everywhere . and lots of stations are closed .
they are like demons , jez .
demons , jake ? come on . they are winos and bag ladies . low life . that is all they are . the streets are crawling with em . do not make em into something they are not . it is the pressure , honey . that is all it is .
those guys tried to kill me tonight . they were aiming right at me .
kids on a joy ride . happens all the time .
they were not human !
come on . what were they , jake ?
i wanna leave . get me out of here .

you know what ? i feel . . . exorcised . . . like the demons are gone .
how come ? the army ?
in a way . at least now i have some idea of what was happening . if we can only get them to admit . . . to explain what they did . . . i do not know . maybe it would clear things up in my head . i will tell you something , jez , honestly . . . i thought they were real .
he did ? when ?
while you were in the shower .
why did not you call me ?
he did not give me a chance . look , honey , do not get upset , but he is not taking your case .
what ? what do you mean ?
he said you did not have one .
that is he talking about ?
i do not know . that is all he said . he was not very friendly . oh , yeah . he said your buddies backed down . they chickened out , he said .
i do not believe this .
baby , i am sorry . i feel terrible . i would stay and talk but i am so late . look , do not be upset . we will talk when i get home . see you around midnight . bye . and do not brood . watch t . v . or something .

i have no idea . i was right . there were experiments . i knew it . i knew it . my god .
how do you know he is telling the truth ?
i am gonna make love to you . that is what i am gonna do .

bullshit !
i promise .

no . i am a marked man , jez . i am the only one left . i do not want to expose you to that . it is not right for you or me . be reasonable .
reasonable ? reasonable ? jake . . . you are getting me angry .
i love you when you are angry .
oh yeah ? try leaving without me .
sit down , jake .
where are they ?
sit down .
no ! that is going on ? where is my family ?
it is over , jake . it is all over .
where have they gone ?
wake up . stop playing with yourself . it is finished .
your capacity for self delusion is remarkable , dr . singer .
who are you ? what are you doing to me ?
you have quite a mind , jake . i loved your friends . that chemist the ladder . what an imagination you have !
how many times have you asked me that ? how many times ?
tell me , damn you !
you know who i am .
with wings . you transport me , you know that ? you carry me away .
hold me , jezzie . hold me .
cause you know goddamn well who i am .
i do not know you .
you have lived with me for two years .
that does not mean shit . where do you come from , huh ? and i do not mean indiana .
what do you want me to say ? my mother s tummy ?
you know goddamn well what i mean .
you are out of your fucking mind . i am not gonna stand around here getting interrogated by you .
well leave then . go to hell .
you son of a bitch . who do you think you are ? i do not deserve this . who takes care of you day and night ? who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear ? well , i have had it . you flip out on your own , you ungrateful bastard . i am done holding your hand . i do not want anything to do with you , you hear ? nothing !
i am okay . i just do not want to lis ten .
you look upset .
i am not upset .
jake , what is it ?
i am tired .
you look terrible . what happened ? jake . . . is it the antidote ?
goddamn it . why do you say that ?
look at yourself . you look like you have seen a ghost .
shit ! cannot i just have a bad day ?
you can have anything you want .
then do not bug me .
i am not bugging you . come and lie down . i will give you a massage . where would you go today ?
mid town mostly .
oh yeah ? what was happening there ?
i picked up my ticket . i am leaving in the morning , jez .
oh ? where you going ?
west .
where is west ? new jersey ?
do not be funny .
i always liked the west , west of il linois anyway . but you gotta give me time to pack .
stop it , jez . do not do that .
do what ? i have not done a thing .
do not play games with me . there s nothing more to say .
sit down , jake .
where are they ?
sit down !
no ! that is going on ? where is my family ?
it is over , jake . it is all over .
where have they gone ?
wake up ! stop playing with yourself . it is finished .
your capacity for self delusion is remarkable , dr . singer .
that is wrong , jake ? forget to take your antidote ?
goddamn you !
i loved your chemist , jake . the height of fantasy . and your vision of paradise . a most romantic creation . you are quite a dreamer , jake . only it is time to wake up .
how many times have you asked me that ? how many times ?
tell me , damn you !
you know who i am .
i do not get it . who are you ? why have you been following me ?
observation , mainly . clinical study . you were one of the survivors .
long time ago .
next thing i know i am on rikers island . ever been there ? suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows , you know . four army colonels , medals up their asses , are standing on the other side . they tell me if i will come to vietnam for two years , no action , mind you , just work in a lab , they will drop all the charges and wipe the record clean . well , i would only been in jail for thirteen hours and i already knew that nam could not be any worse .
shows how much you knew .
no shit . they had me by the balls . next thing i know i am in saigon . . . in a secret lab synthesizing mind altering drugs . not the street stuff mind you . they had us isolating special properties . the dark side , you know ? they wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies .
yeah , sure . we were losing the war .
right . they were worried . they figured you guys were too soft . they wanted something to stir you up , tap into your anger , you know ? and we did it . the most powerful thing i ever saw . even a bad trip , and i had my share , never compared to the fury of the ladder .
the ladder ?
that is what they called it . a fast trip right down the ladder . right to the primal fear , the base anger . i am telling you , it was powerful stuff . but i do not need to tell you . you know .
like it was yesterday .
a couple days later they decided to use the ladder , on one test battalion . yours . just in an infintessimal dose in the food supply , to prove its effectiveness in the field . they were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole goddamn offensive . and you did , too . but not the way they tnought .
a couple of days later . it was fierce . you guys never saw it .
but there was an attack . i can still see them coming . there was a fight , was not there ?
yeah . but not with the cong .
who then ?
if you knew , why did not you say anything ?
the truth can kill , my friend . five hundred men died out there . this is not a story they would ever want out . when paul s car blew up i realized the scope of the thing . i knew they meant business .
so why tell me now ?
because i can get rid of the demons . i can block the ladder . i have an antidote . we can kill them off , chemically speaking . they will all disappear . it is chemistry , my friend . i know . i created it . come with me . i can help .
sometimes . when it is convenient .
how do i know this is not just some kind of , you know , seduction or something ?
hey , i am not the problem . you have got bigger problems than me .
never ?
i would hoped i would never have to . just open your mouth and stick out your tongue .
what is it ?
do not worry . take it . it will free your head . come on .
i do not know .
yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i shall fear no evil , but no one ever said i would not be shitting in my pants every step of the way , huh ? stick out your tongue . that a boy . now why do not you just lie down and relax .
one drop ?
it is strong stuff .
pleasant dreams .
just relax .
that is happening ? help me .
i do not believe this . it is a miracle , michael . a miracle .
better living through chemistry , that is my motto .
well that is good to know .
mike , it was real . it was glorious .
glorious . i am not surprised . i fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven . i am just glad you came back .
i would have stayed there if i could .
i am sure . you have got nothing but troubles waiting for you here .
no . i could not .
what ? you want the plaza ? do not be foolish . here . take this , too . this is my place on prince street . it is got my phone , everything . call if you need me . . . but you will not . everything s gonna work out . you just get outta town as fast as you can . the new york police can be effective when they want to be .
i do not know what to say .
save the words . . . just send back my credit card .
i no from around here .
yeah , you and everyone else .
they are awfully heavy .
i know . that is why i am asking .
that is what i would like to know . if you see him on the street somewhere , tell him he is fired .
hot . where do i sign ?
you got a nice tan , though .
tan ? what tan ? it faded on the airplane . i would try to get my money back , but who do you ask ? two hundred dollars a night , for what ?
if you are lucky .
total delirium .
that is some gash . his guts keep spilling out .
push em back .
help me !
for what ? for seeking the truth ?
please come quietly .
you come near me and i will blow us all up .
we are not going to hurt you .
what is wrong with you ?
what ? !
total delirium .
he will never make it .
that is some gash . his guts keep spilling out .

god almighty . i thought i was the only one .
me , too . i had no idea . it is like i was coming apart at the seams .
oh god . i know . i know .
what is it paul ? that is happening to me ?
they keep telling me i am already dead , that they are gonna tear me apart , piece by piece , and throw me into the fire . i carry these everywhere but they do not help . nothing helps . everyone thinks i am crazy . my mother filed a report with the army .
the army ?
she said i have not been the same since then . since that night . there s still this big hole in my brain . it is so dark in there , jake . and these creatures . it is like they are crawling out of my brain . what happened that night ? why will not they tell us ?

if the ship goes , so does jaso .
rizzo pull the fucking lever !

that is the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship .
what if we blow the walkways first ? leave jason over here to go up with the ship ?

brodski i will talk slow so you can understand me . she is thawing . if we do not get her to the lab , she will die , and that will be on your bald fucking head !
what if they are carrying ? did you even check ?
well , when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her .
damnit , yllo ! i do not like it .
i do not give a shit . this one s prime for decryonization . we are brining her back .
i still think we should send for a team of real scientists .
i am a scientist you asshole ! this could be the most important discovery in years . do you have any idea what a find like this could mean ?
right now , i care only for the safety of this crew . you do not know anything about these two
that is exactly what we need to find out . check your orders , sergeant . i out rank you where discovery is concerned . now step aside . i have a medical emergency to deal with .
my job .
fine , just stay out of my way . hit it .
give it a rest yllo . she needs some time .
looks like we are missing two . stone and kkinsa .
not a chance .
just do not go in there half cocked . you guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later .
you got that right .
at least try to get him alive . . . will ya brodski ?
you just keep an eye out .
yeah yeah . got it .
that is my status ? ! i have lost three men and your worthless fuck ! after i kill this asshole i am coming your yllo !

kicker , sven . get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on !
look ! just get everyone together , get off the ship . . . and then blow it to kingdom fucking come ! that is the only way you are going to live .
do not go out there . you cannot win . we need to get off this ship . that is all there is to it .
not an option . i am going to hunt this son of a bitch down .
weapons ? all this technology and what good has it done ? !
oh man , what the hell happened ?
roger that . time to kick some ass !

damnit ! you scared the hell out of me !
give me a break ! what happened ?
jason . he is what happened . then grendel hit space lab .
space lab ? ! wait will i get my hands on yllo .
yllo s dead . we . . . we thought you were too .
takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down .
i am pulling , damnit !
we have to get off this ship .
i hope so .
is not there an escape pod on this ship ? something ?
yeah and he will be here soon enough . last chance .
guys ! ! ! the shuttle ?
no you do not !
yeah , that is it , scare the hell out of here , that will work .
med kit ?
i guessed .
years in the future and these pea shooters are the best you can do ? !
what if we do not ?
it is better this way . if we were rescued jason would just get off the ship . you want him on your precious earth ii ?
that is a good fantasy , though . kinky , but good .
hey ! !
it is the engine , reactors , audiometers , it is the stuff that makes the ship go zoom .
so , you thought you would be cool . go against your father s wishes ? yeah , that is grown up .
i thought you meant . . .
you thought i meant . . . too tough to apologize , huh ? you must have been a very lonely girl .
were you close to your father ?
and what happend to . . . ?
well , we would be dead without you . you know that , do not you ?
not so bad .
you ?
wait around on your asses all day . i will need a distraction .
oh sure , all the time .
that sounds like rizzo having faith in some of that future shit .
eat me .
okay , good tip .
you will be fine .
no i am not okay ! i do not know what the hell i am doing !
you are doing fine . i will not let anything happen to you , remember ?
i think i had some when i was eight .
did you like it ?
i think so , why ?
i know you .
i am stuck !
oh great . . . yeah , having a great time , and you ?
no thank you , you crazy old woman .
old woman ?
well i mean , technically you are old enough to be my great , great , great . . .
i get it .
we wait . i need about fifteen . call me if there are any changes . if she farts i want a full report .
what about the others ? should not we wait ?
i have waited long enough . kay . . . you know what to do .
she broke my fucking nose !
she needs a little time .
more time . . . shit , she is had years . . .
i would want her statements before we reach porch . jesus , women .
yeah , like you would be a rock after everything she went through ?
oh i like her a lot .
no shit . i got no problem with that .
i am thinking rizzo was right .
thinking with your dick again , delongpre ?
maybe we should go with them . like you said , your space lab connections can deal with this thing . at least we will be safe .
they are not going anywhere . i cut power to the shuttle .
she is obviously dealt with this guy before .
we are screwed .
he is right behind us !
just go ! i have a feeling he is right behind us !
i am on my way .
again ? ! jesus !
just come on , i have got an idea .
kay em , you have saved our lives , you know that do not you ?
well , do something !
shut up , thorgan !
forget her , she is a pain in the ass . let her hang there .
you lost the charge ?
he was chasing me !
they will make it .
close the fucking door !
no !
the mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty twelve .
go , go , go !
remember to roll his balls around a bit .
then do it . the rescue ship can find us here right ?
i get no kick from champaign , mere alcohol does not faze me at all , but i get a kick out of you .
shit ! temp s dropping ! we should have left this rock an hour ago !
keep your shirt on ! i am working on it . you will not believe what we found . adrienne ! stoney !
just get us to the ship !
i will need the sergeant s okay on that .
we have got a situation here ! just do as you are told !
alright , relax . minutes . soon as we have passed tara s rings we will make the course correction .
thank you .
small brains make your balls itch ?
that ought a help the situation .
let s just get out of here .
so what else is new ?
a little late to be thinking about escape , is not it ?
would you ?
you are leaving me here alone ?
later .
you prefer an apple ?
oh my god ! adrienne ?
try to calm down . just think , you are going to be famous !
jesus ! cannot you knock ? diminish power to shutttle beowulf .
crutch ?
maybe she tripped .
are you crazy ? ! pull the lever !
teleportation ? some way to beam us the hell out of dodge ?
i am just saying .

are you finished ?
impossible ! he was dead before he entered cryo statis . there is no possible way he could be alive .
i did not say he was alive .
get him out of there !
why do not you get it ? he is going to kill us all !
you wanna die ?
are we locked down ?
they can deal with this sort of thing .
more soldiers ?

my boat s neat , dad !
i want him out of the ocean .
i am all checked out for light surf and look at it .

dad , the ponds are for old ladies .
just a favor for your old man .
sure , dad .
here take him home .
what ?
cash ? or do we do this on a handshake and a promise ?
i am authorized by the township of amity to hire you as an independent contractor . we will meet your price . , .
and my regular daily rate , whether we catch him or not .
you got it .
and incidental damages , if any . . .
you got it .
and you get the mayor off my back with this zoning crap . nobody tells me how to run my property .
you got it .
and , uh , a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch .
two cases . and dinner when you land .
try some of this . i made it myself .
i know who he is . . .
he is from the oceanographic institute .
what do you mean we . . . ?
it is my charter . my party .
all right , commissioner . but when we are on my ship , i am master , mate and pilot . and i want him . . . . . . along for ballast .
you got it .
who s driving the boat ?
nobody . we are drifting with the current .
. . . cause this is where he lives . you gotta think like they do .
get behind me , dummy ! reverse her and turn he is taking too much line ! wet my reel , quick !
unbuckle me fast ! grab the leader . he ai not normal , this one . . . they never
do not tell me my business ! quarter mile , that way . full throttle .
what i do is trick him to the surface , got that ? then i can jab him , understand ? think i am gonna haul it in as if he is a catfish , like everyone else does ?
what do we do ? get some help ? radio in ?
we got a barrel on him . we cannot lose him . we stay out here until we find him .
you hired me , remember ? it is my , . it is my shark . . .
c mon . middle appendix
i almost had im .
tattoo . had it taken off .
where . . . ?
the bilge pumps . there
shut up ! just pump her out !
yeah , captain , as soon as i make a call .
no ! no ! no ! swing around ! after him !
have to pump her steady , s all .
have you ever had one do this ?
no !
dead astern ! zig zag !
full throttle ! to port !
he is taken him !
cause when we bought the house it was autumn . this is summer . feed the dogs .
do you see the kids ?
probably out in the back yard .
in amity , you say yahd .
the kids are in the yahd , playing near the cah . how is that sound ?
like you are from ngyawk .
give me years , i will get it .
i never hear the whistle .
feed the dogs .
i used to wear this to the garden . garbage strikes . dog shit . muggers . ship it .
do not be silly you are going to make summer better for them . . .
oh , yeah . how do i look ? older , huh ?
i think they make you look sexy .
older , sillier .
i do not want to depend on these things , y know sometimes you can weaken your eyes .
here ? you gotta be kidding .
hey chief . bring my cup back .
ow . he is gotta be more careful in the water . . .
love a cup of tea . with lemon .
where is he ?
he is sitting in it .
michael ! come inside !
it is his birthday present , and you closed the beach , honey . i told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday . i do not believe he will ever do it again .
i told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations , until he was sure of himself . . .
excuse me , but what are you talking about ? did not they catch the shark this afternoon ? it was on the cape station news .
thank you .
can you do that ?
i am chief of police . i can do anything i want . you want to come ?
no . home here .
you going to be all right ?
nothing to worry about i will survive this .
i will see you back soon . there s an extra pair of glasses in your black socks , and there s some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit .
what will i tell the kids ?
tell em i went fishing !
do i need any more authority ?
all i am saying is that amity is a summer town we need summer dollars , and if they cannot swim here , they will use the beaches at cape cod , or long island .
so we should set out a smorgasbord ?
i was only reacting to what i was told .
martin , we hired the best man we could find .
no need to involve outsiders in our business , martin .
i did not agree to that !
that is good . that is real good . ben meadows getting pictures for the paper .
sure he is .
matt hooper , the specialist they send down from the oceanographic institute .
i think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster .
be reasonable , boys this is not the time or the place to do some kind of half assed autopsy on a fish . ben . . . do you have all the pictures you need ?
let s all get out of here , this place stinks .
i am going home .
what kind of a shark did you say it was ?
i do not thing either of you is familiar with our problems . . .
larry , we can re open the beaches in august .
august ! tomorrow is the th of july , and we are going to open for business . it is going to be our best summer in years . if you are so concerned about the beaches , you two , you do whatever you have to to keep them safe , but with you or without you , the beaches stay open this weekend .
why ?
there s only one thing you are good for anymore signing a damn voucher . here . it is an authorization to employ a contractor .
i do not know if i can do that without a . . .
i am going to hire quint to kill the fish . i want to see that shark dead .
maybe we can save august . . .
forget it . this summer s had it . next summer s had it . you are the mayor of shark city . you wanted to keep the beaches open . what happens when the town finds out about that ?
i was acting in the towngs best interests . . .
the best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly up in the water with a hole in his head . you do the right thing . you authorize me . right there . whatever it costs .
my kids were on that beach . . .
just sign it , larry .
you are telling me . i swear , this town has gone crazy .
officer , i wonder if you could tell me where i could find chief brody ?
who are you ?
hooper , matt hooper . from the oceanographic institute .
no , it was local jurisdiction .
left arm , head , shoulders , sternum and portions of ribcage intact . please do not smoke . with minor post mortem lacerations and abrasions . bite marks indicate typical non frenzy feeding pattern of large squali , possibly carchaninus lonimanus , or isurus glaucas . gross tissue loss and post mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis however , teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters . did you go out in a boat and look around ?
no , we just checked the beach . . .
it was not an accident , it was not a boat propeller , or a coral reef , or jack the ripper . it was a shark . it was a shark .
you did it ! did ben gardner catch this ?
what d ya mean ?
there are hundreds of different kinds of sharks makos , blues , hammerheads , white tips . . . any one of them could have attacked . look shark digestion is slow . we could open this one up , and find whatever he is been eating is still inside .
swell .
let s all have a drink .
yeah . like the kid on your beach . i wish i could have examined that shark they caught . . .
something else . do most attacks go unreported ?
about half of them . a lot of missing swimmers are really shark victims .
there s a kind of a lone shark , called , uh . . .
rogue ?
yeah . rogue . picks out an area where there s food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts ?
it is called territoriality . it is a theory .
and before , when people first starting swimming for recreation , before public bathing and resorts , there were very few shark attacks , cause sharks did not know what they were missing ?
you could say that .
what stinks so bad ?
our friend , the shark .
half a flounder . hmmm . . . a burlap bag . . . a paint can . . . aha !
what ? what ? !
just as i thought . he drifted up here with the gulf stream , from southern waters .
how can you tell ?
florida license plate .
he ate a car ?
no , but tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean . they eat anything . but this one did not eat any people . there s nothing here . . .
what do we do ?
if you are looking for a shark , you do not look on land . you go out and chum for him .
chum ?
only one sure way to find him offer him a little something to eat . chum blood , waste meat , fish , anything . they can sense it miles away . if he is out there , we might be able to get a closer look at him . it is a good time , too . they are night feeders . . .
depth finder , fathometer , sonar , closed circuit tv fore and aft rdf , single side band . . . and two loose nuts behind the wheel .
can you tell from that if a big man eater is around ?
sometimes . look here something big , probably a school of mackerel clumped together . and staying right with us .
i bought it . both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me stocks went up , so i do not have to touch my principal .
you are at the institute full time ? or do you have a job ?
it is a job . i am not fooling around like some amateur . it is my life !
we gotta get back soon . . .
i want to check something . hold my feet .
they must have hit something .
why do not we just tow it in ?
we will . there s something i have got to find out .
be careful , for chrissake .
a white ! a great white , i found a tooth buried in the hull . he must have attacked . . . i knew it . . . gardner s dead in there . i did not see the mate . . .
no shark did that to a boat !
you are situation here suggests that a great white has staked out a claim in the waters around amity island , and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water .
there s no limits to where he can strike , and we have had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days . it happened like this before , in , when a great white killed five swimmers at jones beach , in long island .
a shark s attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming you cannot avoid it !
a th of july beach is like ringing a dinner bell , for chrissake !
i just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there .
we towed ben gardner s boat in , larry he was dead and his boat was all chewed up .
that means closing the beaches .
out there is a perfect engine , an eating machine that is a miracle of evolution it swims and eats and that is all . look at that ! those proportions are correct . i know sharks .
i wish it would rain . . .
this is quite a place .
you were on the indianapolis ? in ? jesus . . .
it is a whale out there .
i cannot stand here doing nothing !
no . . . you think we can get back with those ?
wednesday . . . no , it is tuesday , i think .
think the tide s with us ?
just keep kicking .
y know , i used to hate the water . . .
i cannot imagine why .
worthingsly . . . worthington no one ever died on me before .
you picked her up on the ferry .
i did not know her .
and nobody else saw her in the water ?
somebody could have i was sort of passed out .
think she might have run out on you ?
oh , no , sir . i have never had a woman do that . i am sure she drowned .
you from around here ?
no . cambridge . harvard . my family s in tuxedo , new york , though .
you here for the summer ?
some friends and me took a house .
what d you pay for a place just for the summer ?
a thousand apiece , something like that . there s five of us . and we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning , stuff like that .
pretty stiff .
we never had any . that is the problem ?
get out of there take these back to the office and make up some beach closed signs , and let polly do the printing .
that is the matter with my printing ?
that was not funny .
looks more like the readers of the national enquirer .
what else could have done that ?
doctor , you are the one who told me what it was !
i agree . if she is going to advertise , i would not recommend out of town papers . amity people could take care of this .
i am responsible for public safety around here . . .
that is going on with the beaches , chief ?
it is only two thirty . what , are you tired ?
yeah , charlie , i got my second wind three nibbles back .
screw lamb let s shoot the sirloin !
we are blowing half the bounty on bait
set ?
twenty years .
i cannot believe that people pay money to go fishing . this is really dumb . this is not even relaxing . . . it is just boring .
do i set the goddam hook ?
let him do it ! go go go go go !
so would i . come on in .
is anyone having this . . . ?
i would not put it that way . but i love sharks .
you love sharks ?
i do . but you have still got a problem here , there s a shark just off the island somewhere .
you are leaving ?
going out on the aurora .
is that a boat ?
is it ! the best funded research expedition to ever study the shark . . . around the world in months .
like those cousteau specials on television ? i think it is for the kids , but i love them .
better than cousteau , or compagno with computers , telemetry , defense department funding . . .
i saw a show with sea otters , and a big turtle . . . mikey loved it . made me promise to get him one . will you live on the boat ?
yep .
martin hates boats . hates the water . on the ferry to the mainland , he sits in the car the whole way over . he is got this childhood thing , there s a clinical word for it .
this is quint , missus .
i just wanted to know if you were all right . . . the coast guard let me use their radio . is chief brody there ?
he is busy .
well . . . is everything all right ?
just fine , missus . we will be back soon . everything s fine . we have not seen anything yet . orca out .
we had a shark attack at south chop this morning , mayor . fatal . gotta batten down the beach .
i just found out about it but there s a bunch of boy scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl . avril bay , thereabouts . chief went to dry them off .
take my car , okay ? you come with us , lenny .
i have got all these signs here . . .
c mon , it will give us time to think about what they are going to say .
transplants ?
and an america s cup trials . . .
i am not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating . i am talking about working for a living . sharking .
and i am not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark . i am talking about a great white .
are you now . i know about porkers in the water here . tie me a sheepshank .
let me see your hands . . .
look , i do not need to hear any of this working class hero crap . some party boat skipper who s killed a few sharks . . .
i will see ya . tell dorothy hello .
anti shark cage .
who s inside , you or the shark ?
just a little appetizer . i want our porker to know we are serving . i want to put some iron into that big yap . . .
hell , in the old days we went out with good charts , good sounding lead , and a damn good compass . nowadays , these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders , radar , radio , electric toothbrush , every stupid thing . . .
real fine stuff but it will not mean a thing to mr . whitey , of course . . . he did not go to schools in electronics . he was born with what he does best . eat . he is a swimming appetite . course he might eat this stuff , but then i have seen him eat a rocking chair , too . next time , ask me .
it ai not a big mac . the expert do not approve . what do you thing ? you are closer to the situation .
aye , aye sir . stand by to repel boarders . poop the mainsail . argh , jim boy .
let it go , do not waste your time .
down here , hooper !
look you may be a big yahoo in the lab , but out here you are just supercargo , and you will do as i say , or you can take your gear and backstroke home . now get down here !
i am okay . . .
fasten the pole .
what do you see ?
at least you handle the boat all right . stop . here . . . cut the engine .
feet . and three tons of him there .
moray eel . bit right through a wet suit .
ever see one like this ?
nothing ! a pleasure scar . look here
and i will drink to yours .
i think i can top that , mister . . .
u . s . s indianapolis . .
the shaft is giving .
no coming right at us ! slow ahead , he will hit us head on slower ! throttle back
no way ! he cannot !
he is under !
power head with ccs of strychnine nitrate . if i can hit him . i can kill him . but i gotta be close . very close .
let s just cut him open and see that is inside . . .
look , maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this , but i am not sure . . .
i do not have it .
well , i am not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence . we depend on the summer people for our lives , and if our beaches are closed , then we are all finished .
that is it ! i am standing here arguing with a guy who cannot wait to be a hot lunch . goodbye .
i do not think so .
you ran eight miles today , puppy .
i am not hungry , oddly .
but it is breakfast for supper . your favorite , paulie . i made french toast and sausage . patties , not linkies , just like you like it .
thanks for the message .
you know how i feel about her .
you have mentioned it about fifty times .
i just hope you do not consider her a close friend .
hey , cool tiger . looks proud .
yeah , i swiped it from ms . rancick .
cool .
your shorts are looking especially gold today .
my mom uses color safe bleach .
go carole . so , guess what ?
i do not know . . .
i am pregnant .
i am supposed to be running .
i know .
i thought i might , you know , nip it in the bud before it gets worse . because i heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant .
yeah , typically . that is what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant .
so that is cool with you , then ?
yeah , wizard , i guess . i mean do what you think is right .
i am real sorry i had sex with you . i know it was not your idea .
whose idea was it ?
i will see you at school , o . k . ?
i did the prep questions for this lab last night . you can copy my answers if you need to .
but you copy my work every week .
oh yeah . i am kind of a deadbeat lab partner , huh ?
i do not mind . you definitely bring something to the table .
charisma ?
or something .
sorry , bleek . . . going for my ultrasound . gotta note and everything .
okay , cool .
i will try to drop by later .
i just wanted to come over . you know , say hi . i miss hanging out with you on school nights .
i miss it too .
yeah . um , i hooked up a whole private adoption thing . these married people in saint cloud are going to be the parents .
the guy is super cool ! his name is mark and he is into old horror movies and he plays guitar . i actually hung out with him today .
is that normal ?
i asked my dad and bren not to narc us out to your folks , so we should be safe .
oh . that is a relief .
i always think you are cute . i think you are beautiful .
well , i do .
yeah . sure . once tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go .
we could get back together too .
were we together ?
what about katrina de voort ? you could go out with katrina de voort .
i do not like katrina .
i totally heard you did .
i do not . katrina smells like soup . her whole house smells of soup .
um , hi ?
leah just told me you were going with her .
yeah , i did ask her if she wanted to go . a bunch of us from the team are going to benihana , then the prom , then vijay s parents cabin .
your mom must be really glad you are not taking me .
you are mad . why are you mad ?
i am not mad . i am in a fucking great mood . despite the fact that i am trapped in a fat suit i cannot take off , despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back , despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday . . .
katrina s not my girlfriend ! and i doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye . she just looks like that all the time .
what ?
not this time . you do not have any reason to be mad at me . you broke my heart . i should be royally ticked at you , man . i should be really cheesed off . i should not want to talk to you anymore .
why ? because i got bored and had sex with you one day , and then i did not , like , marry you ?
like i would marry you ! you would be the meanest wife of all time . and anyway , i know you were not bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on tv . the blair witch project was on starz , and you were like , oh , i want to watch this , but we should make out instead . la la la .
forget it , bleek . take katrina the douche packer to the prom . i am sure you guys will have a really bitching time !
yeah , well . . . i still have your underwear .
i still have your virginity !
oh my god , shut up !
what ? are you ashamed that we did it ?
no . . .
well at least you do not have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater . i am a planet !
huh ?
you should not be carrying that heavy bag . i will take it .
oh . it is fine . that is another ten pounds ?
yeah . that was me .
why ?
because they are your fave . and you can never have too much of your favorite one calorie breath mint .
well . . . thanks . i think i am pretty much set until college on the tic tac front .
you know , i have been thinking . i am really sorry i was such a huge bitch to you . you did not deserve that . you never deserve any of the poo i unload on you .
you know it is okay .
also , i think i am in love with you .
what , you mean as friends ?
no , for real . i think you are the coolest person i have ever met . and you do not even have to try .
i try really hard , actually . . .
no , you are naturally smart . you always think of the funniest things to do . remember when you passed me that postcard during spanish class , and it was addressed like , junebug macguff , row , third seat from the blackboard ? and it said , i am having fun in barcelona wish you were here ? that was hilarious .
i was just bored . i only think school is awesome like , of the time .
plus , you are the only person who does not stare at my stomach all the fucking time . you actually look at my face . and every time i look at you , the baby starts kicking me super hard .
it does ?
i think it is because my heart starts pounding when i see you .
mine too .
basically , i am completely smitten with you , and i do not care if i am making an ass out of myself right now , because you have seen me make an ass out of myself a million times , and you still want to be my friend .
well , yeah . you are the best friend i have ever had , even when you are being kind of evil .
that is all i need from you . that is more than i could ever ask for . you are just golden , dude .
can we make out now ?
okay .
here is the church and here is the steeple . we sure are cute for two ugly people . i do not see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .
we both have shiny happy fits of rage . you want more fans , i want more stage . i do not see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .
you are always trying to keep it real . i am in love with how you feel . i do not see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .
i kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train . i kiss you all starryeyed , my body s swinging from side to side . i do not see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .
the pebbles forgive me , the trees forgive me . so why cannot you forgive me ? i do not see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .
oh , hey vijay .
did you hear juno macguff is pregnant ?
yup .
just like our moms and teachers !
yup .
did you hear it is yours ?
yup .
what a trip , man .
i do not really know anything about it .
you should grow a moustache . you are a real man now .
i cannot grow a moustache . it never comes in evenly .
me neither . but i am going to stop wearing underpants in order to raise my sperm count . see you .
well , there we have it . would you like to know the sex ?
i just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here . it is obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in .
no . . . i guess not .
what is your job title , exactly ?
excuse me ?
i said , what is your job title , missy ?
i am an ultrasound technician , ma am .
well i am a nail technician , and i think we both ought to stick to what we know .
what are you talking about ?
you think you are special because you get to play picture pages up there ?
no , i mean the father ! who s the father , juno ?
i think kids get bored and have intercourse . and i think junebug was a dummy about it . but we have to move on from here and help her figure it out .
i am not ready to be a pop pop .
you are not going to be a pop pop . and juno s not going to be a ma . somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from jesus in this garbage dump of a situation . i frigging hope .
did you see it coming when she sat us down here ?
oh god yeah . but i was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs .
that was my first instinct too . or d . w . i . anything but this . and i am going to punch that bleeker kid in the weiner the next time i see him .
oh mac , no ! he is a sweet kid . you know it was not his idea .
i would never barf in your urn , brenda . maybe l . b . did it .
hon , did you get expelled ?
no . the school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion .
well , i was just asking . it seemed plausible .
but i am going to give it up for adoption . i already found the perfect people .
junebug , that is a tough , tough thing to do . probably tougher than you can understand right now .
well , i am not ready to be a mom .
well , you are a brave young lady . you are made of stronger stuff than i thought . you are a little viking !
cool it .
first things first , we have to get you healthy . you need prenatal vitamins . incidentally , they will do incredible things for your nails , so that is a plus . oh , and we need to schedule a doctor s appointment . find out where you are going to deliver .
the term deliver is so weird . can we not say deliver ?
i drove to st . cloud to show mark and vanessa the ultrasound . and i wound up staying for a couple of hours .
a couple of hours ? why are you going up there in the first place ?
they said they wanted to know about this stuff . they said to keep them updated , so i did !
you could have sent it to them . why would you drive an hour out to east jesus , nowhere ?
i do not know , i just did . and while we were waiting for vanessa , mark and i watched the wizard of gore and he burned me some cds of weird music . he is kind of cool .
listen , bren duhhh , i think you are the one overstepping boundaries . you are acting like you are the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else . besides , who cares if he is married ? i can have friends who are married .
it does not work that way , kiddo . you do not know squat about the dynamics of marriage .
you do not know anything about me !
i know enough .
yeah , because you are allergic to their saliva . i have made a lot of sacrifices for you , juno . and in a couple years you are going to move out and i am getting weimaraners .
wow , dream big !
oh , go fly a kite .
it is called a spinal block , and you cannot have it yet , honey . the doctor said you are not dilated enough .
you mean i have to wait for it to get even worse ? why cannot they just give it to me now ?
well , honey , doctors are sadists who like to play god and watch lesser people scream .
it really did not hurt that bad having him .
i am a junior .
no , i mean in your pregnancy .
oh . uh , my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said i was twelve weeks .
well , then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved , then ?
shit , yeah . close it up .
no josh , i do not take orders . not from you and not from any man .
you know , you have been acting like this ever since i went up to see my brother at mankato . i told you , nothing happened !
something happened . because your eyes ? are very cold ? they are very cold , josh . they are cold , lying eyes .
what ? my eyes are not lying !
yes they are , josh . since mankato , they have been lying eyes .
fine . call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother s college just because you had four smirnoff ices and a bottle of snow peak peach flavored boone s !
good , i will be sure to do that , amanda . i will make a note of it .
geeeerta rauuuss !
cool . well , let s sit down and get to know each other a bit .
well , i just have the baby and give it to you , right ?
technically , that would be kicking it old testament .
sorry . i was just getting something .
did your wife send you up here to spy on me ?
what ? no ! do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something ?
well , you do not just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised . i could be a total klepto , for all you know .
i do not get a klepto vibe from you . evil genius ? maybe . arsonist ? would not rule it out .
i did steal a squirt of perfume . what do you think ? it is clinique happy .
you should be happy , holmes . i am giving you and vanessa the gift of life . sweet , screaming , pooping life ! and you do not even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in . . .
viscera ?
blood and guts .
we would better get back downstairs asap .
wow , you get a whole room in your own house ? she is got you on a long leash there , mark .
shut up .
what do you play ?
i rock a harmony .
oh .
what ? i am a pawn shop rocker .
sorry . i swear i am not a gear snob .
tell me about it . i used to play in a really tight band back when i lived in chicago , and one night we opened for the melvins . . . do you know who the melvins are ?
yeah .
well , we were playing with them and i busted this guitar onstage . it cost me and a dime bag just to have it fixed .
when was this , like ?
. i am telling you that was the best time for rock and roll .
nuh uh , ! punk volume . you were not there , so you cannot understand the magic .
you were not even alive !
yeah .
that is all right . my axe is named roosevelt . after franklin , not ted . franklin was the hot one with the polio .
i have got something really cool to show you guys . is vanessa here ?
no , she is working late tonight . she is trying to accrue some extra time off for when , you know . . .
come on in . you wanna ginseng cooler ?
sure . what is it with you rich people and your herb infused juices ?
i do not know . something to do with the four packs . . . . . . they are not bad .
i mostly work from home . i am a composer .
no shit . like johannes brahms ?
no , more commercial stuff .
like what ?
commercials .
oh .
have you seen those ads for titanium power mengs deodorant ?
titanium power ! get more snatch by the batch !
i wrote that .
you are kind of a sellout , are not you ? what would the melvins say ?
they would say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home .
you are kidding !
oh , is he bald and amorphous ?
no , he is the dad .
the doctor can tell , but i decided not to know . i want it to be a big surprise .
well , it can really only go two ways .
that is what you think . i drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter babies that is born without junk .
junk ?
you know . . . it is parts . . .
i know what junk is .
yeah ?
we definitely want it to have junk .
well do not worry about it . my stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy . she will not even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red m ms . hope you are ready .
it is only my favorite song . it is sonic youth doing superstar by the carpenters .
i have heard the carpenters before . chick drummer and freaky dude . not unlike the white stripes .
you have not heard the carpenters like this . listen .
hey , i like this .
this album is all carpenters covers by alt rock bands . it is called if i were a carpenter . it is god . i will rip a copy for you before you leave .
you do not have to do that .
it is the least i can do . what did you say your favorite band was ?
i did not . but it is a three way tie between the stooges , patti smith and the runaways .
yeah , i definitely need to make you some cds . at least while my kid is hanging out in there .
oh yeah . it is herschel gordon lewis . he is the ultimate master of horror .
please . dario argento is the ultimate master of horror .
frankly , this looks kind of stupid .
here s to dovetailing interests .
well , sort of . vanessa likes madison for a girl .
madison ? is not that kind of . . . i do not know , gay ?
god , pretentious much ? i guess everyone should have a mysterious name like juno , huh ?
my dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with greek and roman mythology . he named me after zeus s wife . i mean , zeus had other lays , but i am pretty sure juno was his only wife . she was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean . like diana ross .
that suits you .
uh , thanks .
you know , not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this .
i weighed my options . but after all this , i am glad i did not , you know , get rid of it . i want to have it . for you guys .
you are something else .
why ? what the big deal ?
nothing . she just hates when i sit around watching movies and not contributing .
i will handle this . i am really good at diffusing mom type rage .
i came over as soon as i got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis . my stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises .
yeah . mall madness , huh ?
why ?
you should have gone to china . i heard they give away babies like free ipods . they shoot em out of those t shirt guns at sports events .
so , i have been spending a lot of time listening to that weird cd you made me .
i sort of like it . i mean , it is cute .
cute ?
well , when you are used to the raw power of iggy and the stooges , everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison .
i imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point .
consider it your musical education .
i am dying to see what you have got to teach me .
okay , stop surfing porn and get back to work . just wanted to say hi .
go learn something .
is vanessa here ?
nope . we are safe .
come on , i have something for you .
hilarious . no , i just keep all of my old comics down here , and i want to show you one of them .
oh god , you are one of those guys . . .
you are gonna like this , i promise .
is not that great ? i got it when i was in japan with my band . she reminds me of you .
most fruitful yuki is bad ass , man . you should be proud to be the same condition .
i actually know this one .
you do ?
yeah , this song s older than me , if you can believe that . i danced to it at my senior prom .
that is almost interesting , mark . who did you dance with ?
her name was cynthia vogel and she was a good dance partner . even let me put my hands on her butt .
oh man , i can just picture you slow dancing like a dork !
you have never been to a dance , have you ?
only squares and nerds go to dances .
what are you ?
i do not know .
what ?
it is just not working out , but i am getting my own place in the city . . . and i have got it all planned out . it is something i have wanted to do for a long time . . .
no ?
no . no , you definitely cannot do that , mark . that is a big , fat sack of no !
that is the matter ?
this is not what we agreed on . you guys have to take care of . . . this ! you are the chosen custodians of the big ass bump !
i want you guys to adopt the buglet . i wanted everything to be perfect . not shitty and broken like everyone else s family . listen , once i have the baby , vanessa is going to finally be happy , and everything will be all right . believe me on this one !
a baby is not going to fix everything . besides , i do not know if i am ready to be a father .
but you are old !
i . . . how do you think of me , juno ? why are you here ?
i do not know . i just liked being your friend . i sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life .
this . . . . . . this is what my life has become . stuff in boxes . stuff underground . is that so appealing to you ?
yeah , i guess . . . is this my fault ? is vanessa mad at you because of me ?
that is not the point . we are just not in love anymore .
yeah , but did not you love vanessa when you married her ? if you love someone once , you can love them again , i know it . my friend leah has gone out with the same guy , like , four times . you are just not trying .
god , you are so young .
not really . i am sixteen . i am old enough to tell when people are acting like total a holes !
oh , hi juno . how are you ?
good . i am good . did you finish that paper for worth s class yet ?
no , not yet . i tried to work on it a little last night , but i am having trouble concentrating .
you should try adderall .
no thanks . i am off pills .
wise move . i know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once . she took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at ridgedale mall and she was like , blaaaaah ! i am a kraken from the sea !
i heard that was you .
well , it was nice seeing you .
really ? fingernails ?
vanessa , right ?
sure .
you found us in the penny saver ?
a maker s mark , please . up .
yeah , apparently . i am having it on may .
the tough part s almost over for you . i mean , my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest .
yeah , but i hardly noticed it . i am more worried about the part where i have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front .
i think pregnancy is beautiful .
well , you are lucky it is not you .
can i use the facilities first ? being pregnant makes you pee like seabiscuit .
sure . the powder room down here is being re tiled , but you can use the master bath upstairs . go up , then turn left and on your right . . .
room with a toilet , got it .
so , then , you really think you are going to go ahead with this ?
oh really ?
look , if i could give it to you now , i would . but it probably looks like a sea monkey at this point , so i think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter , you know ?
nothing . . .
then that is going on ?
i went to the doctor today .
sure . it is the right size and everything . i even saw its phalanges today ! check this . . .
this is the baby . your baby .
does not it look like it is waving ? it is kind of like it is saying hi , vanessa . will you be my mommy ?
yeah . yeah , it kind of does .
i thought people got all that stuff at baby showers . when my stepmom had my sister i remember she got about a million presents . they were all lame though , so i was not jealous .
what do you mean ? you mean . . . do you think i am going to flake out on you ?
no , no , i do not think that , juno . it is just that , we went through a situation before where it did not work out .
naah . i am already pregnant , so they figure nothing worse could happen to me . i gotta bounce anyway . it was nice seeing you guys again .
just , you know , shopping with my girlfriends .
please excuse leah . she is mentally challenged .
oh , okay . so . . . how are you feeling ?
happy ? oh , you mean like , physically . i am good . look , i have a snooze button now !
are you kidding ? everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly . i am like a legend . they call me the cautionary whale .
elbow .
wow ! it is magical .
nothing .
i am not crying . i am allergic to fine home furnishings . see you later .
your name , please ?
juno macguff .
no thank you . i am off sex .
my partner uses these every time we have intercourse . they make his balls smell like pie .
congrats .
my dad used to be in the army , but now he is just your average hvac specialist . he and my mom got divorced when i was five . she lives on a havasu reservation in arizona . . .
which maneuver , sir ? the one in which i moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another , or the one in which i cleared a sixty four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes ?
no , no , i am definitely not asking for anything . except maybe mercy . like , it would be really great if nobody hit me .
what have you done , junebug ? did you hit someone with the previa ?
you are pregnant ?
i am so sorry , you guys . if it is any consolation , i have heartburn that is like , radiating down to my kneecaps and i have not gone number two since wednesday . morning !
the baby ? i do not know anything about it yet . i only know it is got fingernails , allegedly .
paulie bleeker ? i did not know he had it in him !
no , it is not . paulie is virile , by the way . he was very good in . . . chair .
yeah , well , there s this couple who have been trying to have a baby for five years .
once ! and she did not die , if you recall !
i have no idea what kind of girl i am .
i also have good teeth . no cavities . we finally got fluoridated water in dancing elk .
well , no . . . i am not going to sell the baby . i just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents . i am in high school , dude . i am ill equipped .
hey , big puffy version of junebug . where have you been ?
dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level . where is everyone ?
bren took liberty bell to her tot ice skating class .
tot ice skating ? tots cannot ice skate . liberty bell s still getting the hang of stairs .
no , but you know bren . she dreams big .
yeah , she does .
you look a little morose , honey . that is eating you ?
i am losing my faith in humanity .
think you can narrow it down for me .
i guess i wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good .
you mean like couples ?
yeah , like people in love .
are you having boy trouble ? i gotta be honest i do not much approve of you dating in your condition , cause . . . well , that is kind of messed up .
dad , no !
well , it is kind of skanky . is not that what you girls call it ? skanky ? skeevy ?
please stop now .
tore up from the floor up ?
dad , it is not about that . i just need to know that it is possible for two people to stay happy together forever . or at least for a few years .
it is not easy , that is for sure . now , i may not have the best track record in the world , but i have been with your stepmother for ten years now , and i am proud to say that we are very happy .
well , of course . your old d a d ! you know i will always be there to love and support you , no matter what kind of pickle you are in .
either i just pissed my pants or . . .
or . . .
thundercats are go !
i think the last one was defective . the plus sign looked more like a division sign .
silencio ! i just drank my weight in sunny d . and i have to go , pronto .
jesus , i did not say it was .
well , it is not . you are not a lion in a pride ! these kids , acting like lions with their unplanned pregnancies and their sunny delights .
i do not know . it is not . . . seasoned yet . wait . huh . yeah , there s that pink plus sign again . god , it is unholy .
i am a suicide risk .
is this juno ?
no it is morgan freeman . got any bones that need collecting ?
only the one in my pants .
dude , i am pregnant .
maybe it is just a food baby . did you have a big lunch ?
it is not a food baby . i took three pregnancy tests today . i am definitely up the spout .
how did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests ?
i drank like ten tons of sunny delight . anyway , yeah . i am pregnant . and you are shockingly cavalier .
is this for real ? like for real , for real ?
unfortunately , yes .
oh my god ! oh shit ! phuket thailand !
that is the kind of emotion i was looking for in the first take .
well , are you going to go to havenbrooke or women now for the abortion ? you need a note from your parents for havenbrooke .
i know . women now , i guess . the commercial says they help women now .
want me to call for you ? i called for becky last year .
eh , i will call them myself . but i do need your help with something very urgent .
that is sick , man .
nah , it was a premeditated act . the sex , i mean , not getting pregnant .
when did you decide you were going to do bleeker ?
like , a year ago , in spanish class .
it is extremely complicated , and i would rather not talk about it in my fragile state .
it was magnificent , man !
i could not do it , leah ! it smelled like a dentist in there . they had these really horrible magazines , with , like , spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains , like someone read them in the tub . and the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers , and she told me about her boyfriend s pie balls , and su chin kuah was there , and she told me the baby had fingernails . fingernails !
oh , gruesome . i wonder if the baby s claws could scratch your vag on the way out ?
i am staying pregnant , le .
keep your voice down dude , my mom s around here somewhere . she does not know we are sexually active .
what does that even mean ? anyway , i got to thinking on the way over . i was thinking maybe i could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing . you know , like a woman with a bum ovary or something . or some nice lesbos .
but then you will get huge . your chest is going to milktate . and you have to tell everyone you are pregnant .
i know . maybe they will canonize me for being so selfless .
maybe they will totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to cabo san lucas for spring break .
bleeker and i were going to go to gettysburg for spring break .
there are ads ? for parents ?
oh yeah ! desperately seeking spawn . they are right by the ads for like , iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment . it is totally legit .
come on , leah . i cannot scope out wannabe parents in the penny saver ! that is tacky . that is like buying clothes at the pump ng munch .
yeah , but it sucks for free .
there s a guy in here who s giving away a piano . free for the hauling ! we should put it in bleeker s yard .
you are not listening to me .
no , i heard you . i just cannot give the baby to people who describe themselves as wholesome . i am looking for something a little edgier .
what did you have in mind , a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest ?
i was thinking a graphic designer , mid thirties , and his cool asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass . but i am trying to not be too particular .
all right , how about this one ? healthy , educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five . you will be compensated . help us complete the circle of love .
yeesh , they sound like a cult . besides , they are greedy bitches . they already have three kids !
hey , juno . juno ! look at this one .
i am pregnant .
hey , i am a sacred vessel . all you have got in your belly is taco bell !
touche .
it is really weird looking . it is like it is not even real . i cannot believe there are saps who actually cry at these things .
no way . no , i definitely do not want to know .
or stage parents !
share the love , tits !
what ?
of the penny saver lorings ?
you sound shocked or something .
i just thought she would look really old in real life .
right , seriously .
god , spermy . must you always feed ?
almost eight . you would not believe how weird i look naked .
i wish my funbags would get bigger .
trust me , you do not . i actually have to wear a bra now . and i have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode .
hot !
well , you are kind of . . . convex .
i do not have a choice . keith s been grading me really hard lately .
please do not refer to mr . conyers as keith , okay ? my barf reflex is already heightened these days .
keith s hot .
eww , he is all beardy !
katrina ? pfft , no way . he does not like katrina . it must be a pity date .
he asked her . i heard they were going to benihana , then the prom , then to vijay s parents cabin .
bleeker told me katrina s whole house reeks of soup !
oh , it totally does . i was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like lipton landing . but you know , boys have endured worse things for nookie .
there s no way in hell they are having sex or even holding hands .
i would not be so sure about that . he did it with you . he is a man now .
yeah , well , bleek trusted me . we are best friends .
are you jealous ? i thought you said you did not care what he did .
i am not jealous , and i do not care . i just know he does not like katrina and i do not think he should toy with her emotions like that . she seems so nice and all .
okay juno , i am really convinced .
prom is for wenises , anyway . once you are old enough to go , it is not cool anymore .
oh no . thank you . come on in .
well , have not you ever felt like you were born to do something ?
yes . heating and air conditioning .
well , i was born to be a mother . some of us are .
a pilates machine ?
what do you make with that ?
you do not make anything . it is for exercising .
are you looking for any other compensation ?
vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married .
i want to be a mommy so badly !
juno just wanted a closer look at kimber here .
they are yellow .
well , i wanted to pick something gender neutral for now . once we get the baby , god willing , we can create a more decisive palette .
why do people think yellow is gender neutral ? i do not know one man with a yellow bedroom .
i think i am leaning toward custard in this light . i do not know . i should paint a small area . . .
or you could just wait a couple months . it is not like the baby s going to storm in here any second and demand dessert colored walls .
what to expect says that readying the baby s room is an important process for women . it is called nesting .
nesting , huh ? are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva ?
you should read the book . i even flagged the daddy chapters for you .
i just think it is too early to paint . that is my opinion .
and i disagree .
hm .
can you see it ?
she is hormonal . right , june ? it is just part of the whole process .
i did not do anything . . . i just . . . i have just been thinking .
what ?
just thinking if this is really the right thing for us .
what are you referring to ?
of course we are ready . we have taken all the classes . the nursery . the books
i know we are prepared . i just do not know if . . . i am ready .
it all just happened so fast . we put that ad in the paper . i thought it would take months if , you know , ever and then boom two weeks later , she is in our living room .
she answered our prayers .
ever since , it is just been like a ticking clock .
i do not know . there s just things i still want to do .
like what ? be a rock star ?
do not mock me .
no , it is fine . thanks for making the call , i guess .
looks like it , yeah .
have you found a place to stay ?
yeah , downtown .
a hotel ?
it is a loft .
are not you the cool guy ?
me neither . how about you carrie ?
i suppose anything s possible .
adele . . . we gotta do something before early kills someone else .
adele for god sake please lis . . .
there ai not nothing we could do . once early sets his mind on something , well thats the end of that .
carrie .
. . . i said , i like your hair .
. . . thank you .
karma .
karma . . . you know , if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you .
that french ai not it ?
. . . yeah .
is it hard to learn ?
not really .
. . . yeah , sure .
early grayce if this ai not your lucky day .
so you do not do any of those things .
he whips you ?
i have not . . . i am a fast learner .
how would you meet early ?
you can ?
could i try that ?
it is a portfolio of my work .
your pictures . can i see em ?
sure .
took em all .
no it is not !
hold still .
sorry . boy i will tell ya , if early found a picture of me like that i would be black and blue for a week .
do what ?
adele . . . are you serious ?
you think early s bad to me , do not you ?
yeah .
that is early been in jail for ?
carrying a gun .
. . . anything else ?
ang resisting arrest . . . at least that is what the police said .
jeez . . . adele !
. . . that is not true .
what ?
that is not true !
early did not kill nobody , he would not do that . i do not know why you are saying those things . you ai not my friend .
early , you are so sweet .
well dorothy , why do not you hand me that chili there .
almost .
i guess that would explain why there s so many stupid people around here .
yeah , and in california you never have to buy fruit cause it is all on the trees everywhere you turn . . . . . . and , course there ai not no speed limit out there , and all drugs are legal . . . and i heard your first month s rent is free state law . i figure til we get settled we can just move around month to month . . .
what will we do out there ?
well . . . the very first thing we are gonna do . . . is get us a couple of six packs of lucky lager and climb up on toppa that famous hollywood sign and howl at the moon . . .
bull . that ai not right . . . government sends people there all the time , just do not want us to know about it .
i heard that .
they ai not dangerous adele . they are writers .
yeah i left him with the car . . . we are all squared up now .
you just smile , let me do all the talking .
how many times you gonna tell me that ?
as many times as it takes .
early , can we stop there . . . just for a little while .
early , sing me a song .
go back to the car and keep brian there . i do not want him in here . . . do it adele . . . now !
it is chinese food . it was the only place open . you said you was starving , you would eat anyth . . .
i do not know , they did not speak too good english .
thank you for what ? what are you thanking me for adele ?
. . . i do not know .
well adele . . . it was for . . . . . . saving your fucking life back there !
she had a dream that something like this was gonna happen .
early ! stop ! !
i changed my mind , early . i am not gonna climb up that hollywood sign with you . . . i decided . i think your mean , and you hurt people .
walter livesy .
think . i might just have to kill you walter . how do you feel about that ?
not so good . you sure you have to ?
i do not know . wish i did .
vernon , florida .
never heard of it , any hunting ?
turkey mostly .
turkey s are real smart . smarter than most people think . . .
what do you need a bible for ?
no sir .
best kind .
well , it is like this , mr . kessler .
brian .
well , it is like this , bri . i do not eat much in the morning , never have . maybe a beer once in a while lucky lager s my favorite .
oh . . . i do some work up at the merrick mirror factory , or i used to . . .
that is a good idea . unfortunately most of them have been executed .
. . . too bad .
how much do i owe you ?
forget it .
it is just a work in progress , kinda rough .
this guy killed a mess of people .
who ?
henry lucas .
henry lee lucas . well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred .
wonder what all them people done made him so mad ?
he almost always killed strangers . spent years moving on from one place to another . that made it real hard to track him down .
. . . then some .
dahlia , no .
now why is that ?
some people think it is because he never killed again . he just disappeared back into society .
you do not sound too convinced about that ?
i always thought it was the work of a serial killer . anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again . and again . until someone stopped him .
that your . . . theory , ai not that what they call it ?
yeah .
you wanna hear mine ?
ai not you going to record it ?
shit , it ai not hard to play pool . i can teach you everything ya need ta know .
yeah ?
hell yeah ! i will even spot ya a few points first game .
wait a minute . you are gonna hustle me ?
nah . . . how much money have you got ?
no , it is all yours . it is on me . . . for saving my ass back there .
if you say so .
damn right i do .
. . . ha .

his parole officer .
right , i talked to you on the phone . they say it is a torch job , that sound like your boy ?
could be .
where would we find him ?
hell if i know , crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to texas .
without his car ?
no , but i can tell you he is not gonna be too happy about this .
. . . that would be my guess .
looks like somebody cut off his ring finger .
well now i would say that is the least of mr . diebold s problems .
.
umm . altogether ?
yes . altogether .
hmm . i would say eight , maybe nine .
how many times have you gone unprotected ?
with four of them , i did not use any kind of protection . wait , maybe it was three .
yes .
with how many people ?
umm . three i believe . but i am not sure .
were they wearing condoms ?
uh . yes . twice they were not . two times they did not .
yes !
you are clean .
oh my god . i cannot tell you how nervous i have been . i could not sleep last night .
now you gotta be careful .
was up bitch ?
you fucked it ?
who am i ? who am i ? the mothafucking virgin surgeon .
oh my god , so good . that girl can fuck .
she can fuck ?
hell yeah . that bitch was bleeding . when i first put it in she screamed real loud . i saw her bite down on the pillow .
oh shit . how long did it take ?
did what take ?
how long did you fuck her ?
yeah .
but then when she got into it . she really got into it . it was good .
how did she smell ? did her puss stink ?
hell s yeah . she was so clean .
oh man , that is the best .
you could tell she took care of herself . she had all these powders and creams in her bathroom .
let me smell it again .
what ?
i can tell that she had just entered puberty .
how ?
well , i was flipping through a picture book of her and her family , right .
right .
and there was this picture of her painting easter eggs or something . and i said , you were cute when you were little .
yeah .
and she goes , yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago . i look younger without my makeup .
yeah .
and for a second i felt a little bit guilty . you know , because she is young and all . and then i was like , oh shit , that turns me on . i wanna fuck this little baby girl .
to what ? virgins ?
yeah . it is like all i think about now . not just that , it is like lately during sex , i start dreaming about these complex fantasies .
what do you mean ?
i mean i am dreaming about going all out , crazy shit .
you mean like fucking two virgins at once .
that would be good . but i mean more like . i do not know . like when i was having sex with her , i kept thinking how much i would like to put it in her ass . just to see what would happen .
she is probably smash you in the fucking face .
i do not know about that . she was pretty into it . but i was not gonna try . the whole thing is , you just gotta take it slow . show em some respect .
did you tell her that you loved her ?
like . like . never love . love is for low level virgin seduction guys .
what do you want ?
get another forty . smoke a blunt .
are you hungry ?
hell yeah . fucking starving . wait up a sec .
what for ? that guys a dick .
i am sure he is got food . he is always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer .
you think he is got any herb ?
i do not know , he quit dealing but i will bet he will smoke us out .
you think ?
probably .
he lives on th ?
th .
den less go joe .
yeah .
did she suck your dick ?
a little bit . but i did not really want her to .
why ?
i do not know . that is too easy . i mean getting a virgin to suck your dick . that is so easy .
it is right .
i want to knock her guard down . i mean there s a whole philosophy behind it . having a virgin suck your dick , that is basic because there s nothing lost .
it is no big deal , right ?
right . but when you deflower a girl , that is it . you did it . you were the one . no one else can ever do it .
yeah . the way i see it . my outlook on the this situation is . it is like getting fame , you know what i am saying . it is like , if you died tomorrow , and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first .
yep .
they are gonna tell their grand kids . that telly . he sure was good in the sack !
yeah , i feel dehydrated .
you got any money ?
three pennies and a ball of lint .
you down with the boost ?
unzip my pack , yo .
the cartoon ?
yeah . the wonder twins . you know . activate in the form of , a glass of water .
yeah .
well , those guys share everything , right ?
right .
and once i saw this episode where they pretended they were each other . where they lived the other s life for a day . you know those guys share everything , right ?
right .
and it got me thinking . how fun it would be to share each other s girl .
yeah , that would be fun but i do not like any of the girls you go out with . like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring .
no , i am serious man . i am dead ass . do you wanna try ? we could be like the fuckin x rated wonder twins !
can i do it ? i just broke her cherry . i imagine i can make her do anything . bark like a dog , jump through a ring of fire .
man i have not seen her in forever . what the fuck s she up to ?
yep .
i mean i have been with a lot of girls i know .
yeah me too nigga .
no . casper s right . girls love it . they just act like they do not in front of their friends .
he looks like my uncle .
who ?
darcy . benny s little sister .
oh . you like her ?
yeah . i like her . i have wanted to get with her for a while now .
darcy ?
yeah . she is so little , so pretty , and innocent .
yeah . she is only .
it is funny . last weekend at that block party . remember ?
yeah .
she was handing out those watermelon slices . and i sat down over on the other side , and i watched her .
yeah .
i watched her eat the watermelon . and all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt .
yeah .
and after about two seconds , i got the biggest hard on .
i know what you mean .
at that moment , at that block party , she represented everything holy about a virgin .
she hangs out at nasa . she promotes for them .
i am gonna fuck her tonight . i swear to god i am gonna fuck her .
how are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day ? that shits gotta be against the law .
i do not care motha fucka . i will bet you money she fucks me .
bet .
i guess so . i gotta stop off home too .
why i do what ?
that .
why i give pennies ?
yeah . why you give money .
did you look at that guy ? what the fuck . he had no legs . he had no half his lower body . he is gotta shit out of his ribcage .
that is just it . it is elitist . it is reverse elitism . because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up . i notice what you do .
what are you talking about ?
whenever you see someone who s really messed up , especially amputees and retards . you give them money . but if it is just a regular bum , you pass them by .
so .
so . these people live on the same streets . it is just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up . the regular bums are not poor enough for you , you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks .
so . you never know when you can end up like that .
right .
i will tell you why . because when i was little , i had a fat cousin , cousin luke . and he used to make fun of the handicapped . and one day he had a bad stomachache . so he drank a bottle of pepto and his ass blew off .
shut up .
i am telling you the truth . and after that , i have always giving my money to retards . because that is the reverse of what he did .
good luck ?
yeah , good luck . i mean what the fuck . the guy had no legs .
yeah .
shut the fuck up .
i do not know . how much do you want ?
fifteen for me .
yeah probably .
naw . but we should run by the park and get a dime . maybe darcy will be at the park .
you are ?
yeah . the other day , some sort of chinese bitch told me i would look good with muscles .
why not ? you stink .
that shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach . i like my odor . it is fucking natural .
hold up man .

yeah .
what do i want to do ?
you want to fuck me . but you cannot fuck me .
why ?
because , you know why . you know .
because your a virgin ?
because i am a virgin and i do not want no baby .
you think i want a baby ? when you are with me , you do not have to worry about that kinda stuff .
why is that ?
because i like you . i think you are beautiful . i think if we fucked you would love it . you would not even believe it .
i would not believe it ?
i do not know . i just think that you would love it .
but , i do not know . i am just scared that things would change . between us .
what things ? i am telling you , nothing s going to change . i want to make you happy . that is all .
do you care about me ?
of course i do .
what ?
come dance .
i do not feel so well . have you seen telly anywhere ?
telly is at stevengs . there s a bunch of people over there . come on dance .
i guess so .

no .
what ?
the test is not one hundred percent accurate . you should . . .
i tested positive ?
i am sorry .
but i only had sex with telly .
what ?
well , i do not mean to be a pest . it was just that i was looking at you . and you look upset . i liked looking at you , but your face looks upset . and i was wondering if i could be of any assistance ? maybe i could cheer you up or somethin . help make you happy . who knows ? something maybe .
you are ok ?
yeah .
because gee , you do not look ok . i mean you are a very beautiful young lady . it is just that you look troubled that is all . . .
yeah well , it is been a bad day .
a bad day ! you wanna hear a bad day ? yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor . she had a minor heart attack . partial paralysis . but i do not let myself get sad . no way . not me . it is not good for the soul .

oh yeah , sure . when i was a kid i had a crush on the prom queen . darlene louis . she had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited . darlene louis . you know you look a little bit like her .
thanks .
yeah . right around the cheeks and chin . boy did i have a crush on her . she was the first girl i ever put my tongue in her mouth .
yeah ?
yeah . i am not saying you should get a tattoo . but you should make yourself happy .
what if you cannot make yourself happy ? what if everything falls apart ?
well then , i do not know . you know what you do then ? you forget . block it out . i remember when i was a little boy . my grandmother told me to be happy . she said . she said , leon , my darling little grandson . if you want to be happy do not think . do not bump into any walls . if you stutter . do not talk and i took her advice . and look at me now . could not be happier .
yeah . i was gonna write a book but i cannot spell .
hello paul . is telly inside ?
is telly there ? this is paul . who is this ?
it is jennie . just tell me if telly is there .
oh hi jennie . do you want to come make out with me ?

telly s not here right now . i believe he went downtown . casper too .
i knew he would not want to speak to me . that dick .
you still mad at him ?
of course . how am i gonna forgive him after what he did ? !
and you feel like you are being ripped open inside .
you are being ripped open .
i know .
did you bleed ?
i did not bleed .
you did not ?
no , i did not bleed .
foreplay . foreplay .
passion . . .
boom ! ! ! boom ! ! !
hell yeah , they do not know .
mine ?
mine are like my neck and my chest .
yeah . cause they fucking shoot you in the eye , the face , the ear .
and sometimes it takes a long time , and you are fucking gagging .
yeah . and then it hits that little thing . that little punch bag . what is it ? the tonsils . the esophagus , whatever .
yeah . and you are not getting anything out of it .
and it is like . how much more can i bob here ? you know .
good luck .
that is it . i am gonna have to tell my little brother , i am gonna die . i cannot make him his lunches anymore .
come on . do not cry . we will work it out .
i only did it once and . . .
do not go anywhere . stay with me .
i gotta find him .

i no understand you . maybe crazy .
whah you say ? dissdee ?
it is like yeah whatever . but when you fuck . you wanna fuck that person . you are like ripping each other s hair out . ooooh .
yep .
you know . because sometimes the foreplay is just so good . and then when it actually comes time for sex . it is like the worst letdown .
that is right . that is why foreplay is better than sex .
yep .
because he can like climax you up to that . . .
have you ever swallowed it before ?
right . you know it is not like . . . you know there s a difference between sex , making love , and fucking !
yep .
making love is like .
sweet .
it is like . . .
you know what it is like . it is like when you really love someone , it is like awww .
yeah .
its like . but it gets boring . it is boring .
it is really slow . it is slow boring .
yeah . it depends . cause like this one time with eric , when we got blasted at his house . and smash j and dj flipper was there . . .
oh shit .
and we were blasted , and he must have been dumb horney . and he just pulled me over to the bed . and they were in the room , like getting dressed , like getting ready to go to go to disco
but then the sex gets into the way and you are like what happened ! what the hell happened ? !
yeah it is the biggest disappointment !
yeah . fifteen minutes to a half an hour . hard and deep .
me . i can only take it up to fifteen minutes . cause i get bored .
yeah i get bored .
i start thinking about what i am gonna eat afterwards .
yeah .
and i know that one of them fucked like two other girls , who were both virgins , so i knew he was safe .
yeah .
and the other person i just fucked , which was a mistake . but i went to the clinic last week with jennie .
did they ask you a lot of questions ?
you think so ?
yeah . i have always hated that kid . he used to eat glue in like seventh grade .
he still does .
i hate em .
it is not his fault . he had a hard life .
yeah ?
you have heard the stories right ?
no .
oh god . that is horrible .
holy shit . that is all true ?
no . i was just kidding .
what ? !
i lied . his dad is still alive . he works for the post office .
hi telly . where you been ?
but then i will not need your money .
that is right .
shh .
i am gonna go out for a little while .
when are you gonna be back ?
not too late .
four thirty in the morning ?
not too late .
if i had it , maybe . but right now i do not have a penny to my name .
all right .
it is me . telly .
hello ?
paul it is telly . open up .
nothing . we just wanted to come by and see what you were up to .
you want a wip it ?
nah .
i do not know , eight or nine .
where does everyone sleep ?
everywhere . fucking flophouse . we are still short on the rent . if you want , you and casper can move in . you guys can share the bathtub .
yep .
that shit is nothing . i remember , i had just turned . with this fucking asshole who was like . i do not even remember his name . i think it was john or jake or something . i remember he had a brother named lentil because i would always joke and call him lentil bean . this was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit .
it is grandmother style .
it is very monotonous .
and we were like underneath the sheets . we were going at it like crazy . oh my god that shit was so good ! it was like hard . . .
yeah .
he was like sucking my tits . he was fucking fingering me . but that shit was nice and hard .
to come ?
yeah . i had sex with jake , and it took him like an hour and a half .
it is like sweet and sour , and salty butter .
no , no , no . you cannot get that taste out of your mouth . until you eat something .
yeah .
you can drink like there s no tomorrow but you still cannot get that sperm between the teeth out . it is so disgusting .
yo , let me get in your parent s room man . just fir a little while .
i cannot man .
come on steven hook me up . do me this solid . come on man . i gotta get darcy alone . she is gonna let me fuck her man . please .
shit . all right . but do not fuck with anything ok ?
ok .
chess tournaments can be boring sometimes . people have a lot of free time . they like to gossip .
yes .
what kind of problem ?
i think you are lying . that is what kind of problem .
what are you saying ?
casual ? you were boning her were not you ?
it was not serious . that is your problem ?
you are ! i do not like you .
fine , do not ask me out on a date .
it means , if i were a killer and i thought the police were closing in on me i might invent someone to try and put them off the scent .
that is crazy ! why would i draw attention to myself like that ?
you like to play games , do not you , peter ?
he says on the photo he will call tomorrow at eleven . why not come back then and listen for yourself .
oh , we will be back . you can bet on it .
no .
he says it is a game . all games have a strategy .
all you gotta do is look at the map .
his victims are not random . it only means that they appear to be random . there s a connection , we just have to find it .
what ?
not what who . morpheus . the greek god of dreams . look at the next line . her god has gone and left his home .
let s see how much he wants to play .
you think you are going to catch him on a trace ? everything he does is planned out well in advance . the only way we are going to get him is to rattle him make him slip up .
maybe you should .
you do not have an investigation without me . you got that ?
i would not know .
that is right . i guess only the killer would know that .
how would you get in here ?
the door was open .
no it was not .
of course it was . otherwise i would be breaking and entering . that is a felony .
what do you want ?
you ever do any hunting , peter ?
i used to . with my old man . he taught me how to hunt and trap . trapping s a lot harder than most people think . we used to go after raccoons mostly . they would get into our garbage , our fields . when an animal cannot live peacefully with those around it , it has to be destroyed . but they are crafty little devils . you see the trick is , you can put your trap down , but no raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent . you ever smell raccoon scent ? smells like shit , but to a male raccoon it smells just like pussy . he will walk right up to that trap , even though it do not look nothing like a raccoon and stick his goddam head right in it . you know why ? cause he cannot help himself . the scent drives him . so , if you want to catch a raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is lay down the scent and sooner or later he will walk right into the trap .
what if he does not bite ? what if he is an exceptionally bright raccoon ?
well then , you just gotta find out where he is and once you are sure where he is you shoot the fucker .
no , i need the original note .
there s a photostat of the original on the wall .
then that is he talking about ?
if we knew that we would know the answer to the riddle , would not we ? he is telling us where he is going to kill tonight and we cannot see it .
homesearchers .
i was at the beach .
i am positive .
you are a lying bastard !
fuck you ! i am tired of your goddam accusations ! if you want to arrest me go ahead ! otherwise back off .
it is all a big game is not it ? a sick , fucking game . i do not know if there s two of you involved , or what but we are going to find out . last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place . it must have shocked the hell out to you when frank walked in on pine road and you could not finish .
get off me !
what ?
sit down !
i want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer .
it will take hours . you cannot make me do this .
you are right , i cannot make you do it . besides , you are probably gonna be too busy with the franchise tax board anyway .
what are you talking about ?
i gotta friend over there . he was telling me things are kind of slow . so , i figured i would give him a call , have him come down here and look through your records . you know , give him something to do .
that is the first street ?
run it down .
local ?
no . she just moved here last month from portland .
he is got an answer for everything , but he does not have an alibi .
you think he is dirty ?
i do not know , but i think you are right . he is lying .
what was your relationship with her ?
i am sorry , this is just too convenient .
could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal ?
anything ?
check with the state . if he is never killed outside of washington the f . b . i . would not have it . nolan ?
yeah , i am . i think he is playing us . if i was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me , what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else ?
maybe he is going to drug her ?
she is unconscious , but they think she is going to make it .
you alright ?
i have seen a lot of things in my time on the job , but nothing like this . yurilivich ?
i was with him the whole time until i got the call at the hotel .
sanderson ?
find him ! i want to talk to him .
it is a voice modulator .
i have got a feeling we are going to go the distance with him . let him sweat for a little while .
you were not mad at him for picking up the phone ?
he is one of the best chess players in the world . who better to play a game with ?
i do not know . maybe there s two of them . maybe he hired some wino to make the calls .
maybe you are reaching a bit ? i think sanderson should be in on this . there s a reason why the killer s calling him .
did anyone stand out ?
what do you mean , stand out ?
did anyone look suspicious ? think !
now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious .
what was suspicious about him ?
but a hundred men could move him .
he was with me ?
oh , c mon . we are not going to spend any more time on this crap , are we ? it does not mean anything . it is sanderson !
it is not him . frank , you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this .
jesus , you are sleeping with the guy . you have lost your perspective . you cannot possibly be unbiased .
you could not find your dick in a wind storm !
who is this ?
someone who s going to become an important part of your life . i want to play a game with you .
i have not got time for this .
just a second . hello ?
yes . why did you kill debi rutlege ?
to get your attention .
did you know her ?
no , only the path she chose to travel .
we all have paths to follow . you hope yours will lead you to me .
why did you write remember on the wall ?
that is something you will have to figure out for yourself . really , peter , you cannot expect me to answer such direct questions .
why not ?
you do not want to think and that is why i will win ! i am already two points ahead .
what ?
where is she ?
you will find her .
if you got something to say to me , just come out and say it !
you are not going to tell me that .
wee willie winkie runs through the town . upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown . crawling through the window . at the end of miss emma s street . her god has gone and left his home . so her and i can meet .
do you know what i am doing right now , peter ? i am looking at the name of the girl i am going to kill tonight .
you know her ?
not really .
why her ?
because she is the type .
but you said you did not know her .
i know what i said ! she looks just like . . .
just like who ?
i really wish you would stop trying to maneuver me . i find it irritating , not to mention insulting .
i am just trying to play the game .
you are not playing very well . there are clues all around you and you keep missing them .
then call them !
why are you doing this ? you must have some idea of the pain you are causing people .
pain ? pain is just a state of mind . it is something you learn to live with . i have .
please , i do not want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions . it would detract from the game .
how ?
i could not say it any better than huxley .
so is mine , within the framework of my rules .
if it is so important , why do not you just tell me ?
i could not tell you that . it would ruin the game . not that you are playing it very well .
you like to brag , do not you ?
you heard me . why did you go out to the institute looking for her ?
what makes you think i was there ?
i could not tell you that . it would ruin the game .
the game s almost over , peter , and you are running out of time .
very nice speech , peter . did you rehearse that , or was it impromptu ? there s an old wooden bench in the garden . next to it is a rock . you will find a message for you under it . let s see if you are as clever as you think you are .
last night was very exciting , was not it ? have you figured out what i am doing ?
you are playing the tarakoss opening .
very good .
you are next move should have been e e .
i used a variation . you should have anticipated that . have you figured out the message ?
what word did you leave last night ?
the police have not told you ?
they think that you and i are doing this together .
i am beginning to think it does not mean anything . remember eventually revenge
you are hopeless ! you cannot even read a sentence ! did not they teach you punctuation in school ? the game ends tonight !
you sonofabitch !
emotional ? i expected more from you .
if you kill tonight and i am in jail the police will know i am innocent .
by that time the game will be over .
i have figured out the message .
no you have not . and even if you had it does not matter . who would you tell ? the police do not believe you , and you have just used your only phone call .
congratulations on your daring escape . you just missed me by a few seconds . it is check , peter .
let me speak to my daughter .
she is in the other room . i just wanted you to know she was not dead . . . yet . but it is time for her to die now .
please . . . wait .
the game s over . you lost .
it is me you want . not her .
no . as usual you are wrong . it is her i want . killing you would be easy . living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat .
you are groping . i have been fair . it is my move now .
i will give you anything you want . anything ! please !
do not beg , peter . she has to die . i cannot win unless she dies .
no ! wait ! !
very good . how did you know ?
the pipes .
you told me . when you called you said she was in the other room . drop the knife .
you do not understand .
yes , i do . i found your file . i know what happened .
they took away the game because of him . my father left and my mother . . . there was so much blood . . . it covered everything .
i know , but this is not going to bring her back .
i think your mother knows that now . why do not you put the knife down . put it down , david .
thanks .
oh , i put a few games on for your daughter . i hope you do not mind .
of course not .
can we correlate data ? look for specific things , like player s ages . . . stuff like that ?
no problem . we are in .
okay . run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the island .
set up some pieces on the big board ?
mister sanderson , they will be hundreds of thousands of games .
have computer search for anyone that is used that opening against me . there cannot be more than a handful .
never mind . he died two years ago .
. hans korshaud .
he is in his seventies and lives in holland .
new york . . viktor yurilivich .
you still have not figured it out , have you ? you think that i have put you through an ordeal . my scars run so much deeper than yours .
what scars ?
the scars on your chest . from where i stabbed you with my fountain pen .
you are damn right ! i am a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer !
would you mind keeping your voice down ? i have guests .
oh , well we would not want to disturb your guests , would we ?
you could have been honest with me for starters . we work together . i have to be able to trust you .
i admit i handled it badly . sanderson was not going to talk to me . . . but you are young , attractive
the same type as the girl who got killed . jesus , alan , the guy could be a psychopath .
they asked who would be best suited for this and you
do not patronize me ! you sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and did not warn me !
fuck off !
i just cannot believe it .
you do not want to believe it . it is a normal reaction .
how come the police never had a record of sanderson before . this does not come out of nowhere , there has to be a history .
i am just nervous . sorry .
you are safe . he would not come here .
he already did once .
why did he what ?
come here .
he was watching you .
yeah that is what we have always thought but what if he was not ? what if i had nothing to do with the reason he came here ?
you are losing me .
uh huh .
i am kathy .
he went down to the lobby for a minute . he should be right back . would you like come in ?
not really . it is pretty boring .
that is only because you do not know where to go . you like hiking ? fishing ? sailing ? what do you like ?
boys .
of course .
how do you know that ? did he say something ?
no . . . but i can tell . a woman knows these things .
nice meeting you .
my cheering section .
i cannot sleep . my beds lumpy .
i see . you forgot to bring you are night light , did not you ?
that has nothing to do with it .
you want to sleep in my bed tonight ?
okay .
mrs . lutz . she also told me that mr . lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great grandmasters in the spirit world .
has he gotten through to any ?
no , but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from ohio .
nothing .
thanks , david .
for what ?
you told me you would take me over to seattle today .
i am sorry , honey , i cannot . not today .
but you promised .
who s kathy ?
not much . there s no sign of a break in . i think she let him in .
how long has she been dead ?
six , eight hours tops .
any sign of rape ?
not that i can see . we will know more once i get the lab reports back from seattle .
bingo .
not much . i do not think she was raped . there s no bruising , or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath .
what about prints ?
no prints .
you mean , no prints but hers ?
no frank . no prints .
there s only two hardware stores on the whole island . we will check that out . what about the blood ?
not a drop . maybe the guy works for the red cross .
that is great .
wait , i have saved the best for last . andy , hit the lights , will you ?
yeah .
how long she been dead ?
i would say at least eighteen hours .
that means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message .
well what ? i told you this was a stupid idea . you cannot learn anything from someone in a few minutes .
you did not pick up any vibes from the guy ?
i am a psychologist , frank . . . not a psychic . that is this all about anyway ?
what did dr . fulton tell you ?
we are not sure .
what do you think he did ?
we think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation .
it is important .
and this jeremy
edmonds . i know . you lost to karpov in , did not you ?
but we heard him .
it could have been a tape . a prerecorded conversation between sanderson and himself .
well , the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim .
what about the way he arranged the body ?
anything else ?
yes . why disguise your voice if no one knows it ?
i was thinking the same thing . he must be local . it is logical for him to assume that the police would be there , but he recognized andy s voice and called him by name . what about this ?
i would think it is some type of clue as to where he is going to kill next ?
meaning ?
call dispatch . double the patrols . i want that area blanketed .
i know that . i have seen the photo s .
this ai not no photo .
peter s right , captain . he is got to be forced into making a mistake .
what did he mean by huxley ?
i thought that homesearchers was a dead end ?
it cannot be a coincidence . the woman that owns it has a son . she says he is been on vacation in montana for the last ten days . we are trying to locate him . there s also a cleaning service that comes in once a week . we are checking that out too .
he moves around a lot . why ?
that is a big area to cover .
yes . why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure ?
about a quarter to one .
what are you saying ? that i am seeing what i want to see ? that i am protecting a murderer ? what ?
what does that mean ?
we are going to work on the message .
this stinks ! you want to know what i think ? i think there have been five murders and you have got shit to go on . you need to blame someone and he is the easiest choice .
the most logical choice .
you do not have a shred of evidence !
no . he was wearing a mask . . . but i saw the cut on his wrist . it was peter .
i cannot arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist . do you have someone you can stay with tonight ?
i have got a room at the institute i use when i stay late .
okay . why do not you go out there . we will check in with you later .
you know , i hate to say i told you so , but i warned her . coming home at all hours of the night . a young girl new to the city . this neighborhood ai not what it used to be .
ten days ago .
do you know how she found the apartment ?
through a rental agency .
did not you tell me that debi rutlege had just moved into her place also ?
only in passing . to say hello to .
here . i played gregory lutz .
i know . you won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five . where did you go after that ?
to my room and then i went for a walk .
she called to give me my schedule for tomorrow .
that is interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing . yet , she says on her message for you to call her at home and she does not leave a number . that would imply you already knew the number .
i got it from the tournament directory .
i do not know . i was afraid there would be hours of questions . i cannot afford to miss a game .
we have already met . have not we . . . doctor .
that is alright . we will take it from here .
wee willie winkie runs though the street . we think he might be making a reference to himself .
maybe , but i do not think so . i think it is just a tease .
upstairs and downstairs in his night gown he could be saying the house he is picked is two stories .
we think he might be making a reference to drugs ? miss emma is a street term used by junkies for morphine .
could emma be the name of the girl he is going to kill ?
is . did you tell him about the institute ?
it does not make sense .
how can he be playing chess with you ? you are not making any moves against him .
maybe i already have .
that is all he needs . he is making the moves . it is an opening . i just cannot remember the name . okay , it is a game . he is starting it , so he moves first . he is white . e e .
but he had to dump the body there to make the move .
a building ?
a building is not as light as air . that is large , but as light as air and cannot be moved ?
he uses castles . . . plural then says cannot move me . singular . not cannot move us .
wait a minute . there s an apartment in that area called the castle arms .
that is got to be it .
are we going to go through this again ?
answer the question .
i went out .
maybe he just got tired of covering for you .
this is insane ! cannot you see that is going on . the killer wants me out of the way . he is setting me up .
i understand that this is just another one of your games .
look , i will do anything you want ! i will sign anything you want ! just send a car out to the hotel .
i signed the confession . what about the car ?
it is over , peter . let s stop the games . i am not sending a car .
he knows you are aware of that .
then i will transpose .
on a variation , yes but it must be a variation that is unique .
i suppose you have something in mind ?
you do not win by playing it safe , peter .
our computer went on the fritz again . david came up to fix it .
is it serious ?
i have got be here for the police when they come . then i have got to practise . in case you forgot i am in the middle of a match right now .
you are always in the middle of a match .
i want to be the best i can .
just thought you might want to talk .
about what ?
whatever s on your mind .
who says something s on my mind .
mate in five .
exactly . . . and you did this .
no .
feel like practicing ?
yeah . just let me grab a shower .
hi , sara . this is doctor sheppard . i was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called principals and tactics by anton berger .
i can check and call you back .
thank you . i am at .
we will call you back .
sara , this is doctor sheppard . i called you earlier about a book .
yes , doctor sheppard . we called you back but you were not home . we have the book .
could you please do me a big favor ? in the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess . could you look and tell me what they are ?
of course . yes , here it is . why , they are all the same ?
what are they , please ?
carefully . carefully . carefully .
it is alright .
yes .
how come you do not stay with them ?
because i love them , but they drive me crazy . you know how parents are ?
no . i do not .
uh huh .
are you one of the players ?
yes .
i have always wanted to learn how to play chess . i do not have the patience for it . when did you start playing ?
when i was very young .
it seems like such a complicated game .
not really . you see your goal and you go after it . anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed .
sounds very violent .
chess is a reflection of life . life is violent . the strong win . the weak perish .
if you are asking me if i am passionate about what i do , the answer is yes . without passion , nothing moves us . that is your passion ?
that is a very personal question .
i see . this is going to be a very polite conversation . what shall we discuss ? the weather ? movies ?
are you disappointed that i will not answer you ?
i had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation .
i thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess .
it is .
do you always open quickly ?
are we talking about me , or chess ?
you .
each circumstance requires a different tactic .
well , i hope you remember that tomorrow when you play krikorian .
getting too hot in here for you ?
nothing . i just came in for a steam .
no you did not .
did you think it was going to be easy ? you think he was going to lay it out at your feet ?
we need your help .
i offered my help this morning and sedman turned me down .
but you are the key . the one he wants to play the game with .
i cannot right now . i have got a game .
she could be dead after the game .
she could be dead now .
what if she is not ? where are your priorities ? you have to think between someone s life and a chess game ? the girl he killed last night was only twenty one years old ! he dumped her body behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage !
i do not think i could .
you sound like my mother .
it was not intentional .
does that is going on bother you at all ? or are you just wearing your game face ?
another kind of game ?
in a way .
this is not a game .
oh , but it is . he is killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him . that is a game . it has rules and objectives .
how can you look at it so clinically ?
take your average cop . they deal with death everyday . if they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement .
that is true but the emotion is still there . they just learn to control it .
what about you ? are not there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry ?
of course .
do you ?
let s change the subject .
okay . so , tell me about yourself . are you married ?
i think it is best if we do not ask too many personal questions i want to keep things on a professional level .
you mean like in the steam room ?
that is not fair !
are you going to tell me you did not feel something in there ?
very good . spoken like a true psychologist . when confronted with the prospect of your own reality , hide behind quotations . what is that masters and johnson ?
i just wanted to know if you are involved with anyone ? let me ask you something ? do your colleagues know if you are involved or not ?
of course .
why ?
because i work with them .
you are not ?
no i am not involved . and i plan on keeping it that way .
how the hell can i relax after seeing what i just saw .
i know it was bad .
how could you ? unless you were there .
you know , andy thinks you are doing this .
does not that scare you ?
no .
why ?
because i think he is wrong .
no . but i am open to distractions .
i am sure you are .
you always want to talk about me . what about you ?
was not i just talking about me ?
no . you were talking about chess .
alright . what about me ?
i dunno . where is erica mother ?
she died in a car accident .
i am sorry .
it is alright . it was a long time ago .
it must have been very hard on erica ?
it was .
and you ?
have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games .
i am not playing a game now .
yes you are . you are playing word games .
what is this ?
i am just trying to get to know you , peter .
what ? by attacking me ?
what are you talking about ? you do not even know me .
does anyone ?
then show me who you are .
you have got to face the things you feel .
i thought you were the woman who did not want to get involved .
i said i did not plan on getting involved .
no .
call room service .
what do you want on it ?
you .
would you settle for pepperoni ?
if i have to . i am going to take a shower .
the line was busy . i will try again .
i thought you said the line was busy ?
i tried again and got through .
that is wrong ?
nothing .
then why are you backing up ?
admit what ? that i was right about you in the steam room ? that you are willing to do anything to find out what you want ? would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room ?
how could you think that , kathy ? how could you even consider it ?
for emphasis ?
exactly . it is the key .
but what does he mean by a fierce magazine ? violent ?
a fierce magazine . . . brutal . . . an angry magazine . . . a war magazine . . . a mercenary magazine . . . fierce . . . mad .
what ?
where is the note ?
because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid ?
right . here ! c .
can i come in ?
i am not looking for an apology , peter .
i was thinking that . . . maybe when this is all over we could . . .
i want someone i can get close to . i do not know if that is possible with you .
you really have not seen my best side .
no , listen . you have no idea of the kind of pressure i am under right now .
that is still no excuse . you treat everything like a game .
i cannot think any more , unless it is about you . i will be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move , i think about how you look when you smile . remember how you said that i hide behind my chessboard ? ever since my wife died i have been . . . i have been afraid of getting too close to someone again afraid of losing them .
you are wife died . you cannot feel responsible for that .
you do not understand .
then help me to understand . i want to understand .
it is not that easy .
of course it is not . it is always difficult when someone you love dies . but you cannot feel responsible because she had a car accident .
but i do .
why ?
because she killed herself ! !
why not ?
because i know what it says .
maybe you are afraid of what it says .
it could be anything .
it is got to be grammatically correct .
frank told me .
no he did not .
he did not tell you either .
of course not .
are you going to come tonight ?
yeah . i will be there later .
i got lucky .
there s a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you . you made a difference .
i just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future .
do we have a future ?
i am sure you are .
no , i want you to do good . that way when i beat you at the end i will look that much better .
you are getting sloppy , yurilivich . you are nervous ?
i am not nervous .
well , you should be , because this time i am going to win .
well , then this time you will have to stay for the whole match , will not you ?
i do not have to go through with it either .
you do not understand . i am just so u relieved u . i was u sure u you would turn out to be short and fat and gimpy .
oh . that . i know what you mean . i had nightmares all week .
me too .
last night was the worst . i dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other , and walked like a penguin .
mine was worse i dreamt you picked your nose in public .
that is worse .
you are really not bad looking . almost handsome .
well , you are beautiful .
you u might u be handsome . i cannot tell through all that grime . besides , you reek of sweat and horses .
if you are going to marry a warrior , you would best get used to it .
i have no intention of getting used to it .
u what u ?
we are almost married .
we are not married u yet u .
well , then you can go up to the parapet and i will hand the buckets up to you .
never mind my ears ! go away !
maybe you would better look around for another candidate . i do not think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush .
i do not have to look around . i have found the husband i want . you can kiss me now .
thank you , but i can wait .
i cannot .
about what ?
i cannot wait either .
colwyn .
no . they watch me closely , but they have not harmed me .
in a great fortress in the mountains . wait . something s happening .
colwyn . . .
where is the fortress ?
i do not know . it is a maze of tunnels . i cannot see out .
i will find you . i will be with you .
i know it .
i love you , lyssa , i love you . . .
colwyn . colwyn . i love you , colwyn .
you must move away from the center .
all the passages are guarded .
i do not know how .
you have the power . u will it u .
all directions are the same here .
move quickly . we are coming for you . we are in the fortress .
i knew you would come .
come quickly , colwyn . i can see the eyes of the beast .
that way . i can feel the cold .
yes .
it was a platonic kiss , father .
of course it was .
you cannot reach her ! through the door . quickly !
i will not leave you here .
you will do as i tell you . you will try to reach ynyr , the old one .
i must follow the slayers . they have taken lyssa .
you will not follow the slayers , you will obey my command ! you have no chance alone , boy . you must try to break through to ynyr . he has great knowledge . only with his help can you save lyssa .
does the queen live ?
the new queen lives .
turold s son was to marry her .
we were married . then she was taken by the slayers . you must help me .
i have lived in this place , like my fathers before me , guarding the old knowledge . i knew , when i had no son , that the great war would come in my time , and that i would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king . come .
i have no extraordinary powers .
your powers are greater than you know . have you ever seen one of these ?
in the old books . it is called a glaive .
two or three days ! while lyssa is in their hands ?
there is no other way .
but there is another entrance to this place .
you have rope ?
i am too old to climb down a rope .
you will not have to .
reach out farther . call to her .
lyssa . . . lyssa . . .
she was in a great fortress , first in the mountains , then in the jungle . how is that possible ?
it is the fortress of krull . i know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds . they did not use it on our world in the first great war , for it costs them enormous power . this time they mean to conquer , at all costs .
the fortress moves ?
yes . each dawn it rises in a different land sometimes in the mountains , sometimes in the jungle , sometimes the desert , sometimes the sea . never in the same place twice .
then even if lyssa tells us where she is , we will never be able to reach her , for they will never allow the fortress to rise near us .
no . they occupy the fortress , but they cannot control its movement . it is moved by fate . and , sooner or later , fate will place it near us .
then we must be ready . five leagues from here is the eastern tower . i know the barons who hold it . good men , and brave . they will help us .
you have not slept in two days .
nor will i , till my bride is beside me .
yes . they will be more help than high born barons .
everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death .
what do you see ?
darkness . tunnels and corridors . wait .
yes , they knew of your first contact , so they drove her below .
she was very faint . i was barely able to reach her .
the deeper she goes , the harder it is to contact her . once she is below the second level , you will not be able to reach her at all .
i will find her !
she is too deep . the curved tunnel we saw is part of the vortex , the place of the beast .
no . then they were led by his underlings . but i knew he had come this time , from the ferocity of their onslaught , from their use of the fortress . they use up much of their strength to do these things . they are taking great risks .
u why u ?
i am not sure .
but you suspect .
you will know , in good time .
there is no other way . you asked me why the beast had come this time .
yes .
he has come for lyssa .
lyssa ? u why u ?
like you , she has extraordinary powers . he would make her his queen .
can she be forced ?
no . she must agree of her own free will .
never .
you are young . you do not understand the attraction of great power , and you forget the pain of long waiting .
then we must reach her before she feels that pain .
yes .
he thinks you betray him with lyssa . colwyn ! the waters deceive you !
he sees betrayal everywhere . he will attack us so long as he is conscious .
you will tell me her name and we will go together .
you must never know her name . if more than one approaches , she will certainly kill them . alone i may have a chance .
let us wish him peace .
the beast will kill her .
yes . to keep her from you . but now that we are inside the fortress , you will be able to contact her .
lyssa , your bracelets . bend them straight and cross them .
where the spiral begins .
i chose the wrong passage .
she can see the beast !
use your sword .
what use is my sword ? i cannot reach her !
cut . u cut u !
you are coming with us .
it is my fate to die in the fortress .
no ! you cannot know that !
i can . because i choose it .
i forbid you !
i found the body of the seer in the stream .
we must enter the swamp .
what will happen ?
you have done it ?
i road them often in my youth .
saddles .
yes . it is today .
each to his fate .
perhaps you think no man would return to me .
i do not think that .
yes .
am i not beautiful enough to be loved ?
yes .
even by you ?
yes .
i ache with it .
let me comfort you .
i cannot take comfort when she has none .
then give me comfort . sleep with me tonight .
i cannot betray my bride .
one night is no betrayal . have pity on me . please , i beg you , do not refuse me . you do not know the price .
you will not , then ?
i cannot .
i doubt it . the water is only an inch deep .
it could have been quicksand ! i might have been sucked to my death . where is this place ?
a forest near the valley of needles .
blast ! a thousand miles off course . well , i was rushed . there was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie . the foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill . what did he expect ?
perhaps he expected to eat it .
for that rudeness , peasant lout , i am going to leave you hanging by your heels when i depart . which is right now .
what business ?
staying alive .
he saved our lives .
i was hoping i might be your friend .
my u friend u .
i have need of friends .
no more , my lord my friend . with ergo the magnificent by your side , your enemies are dead men .
u what u ? oh no ! better it was me . there is not another good tomato within a hundred leagues .
you and i will guard the fire .
what else is left for a man without friends .
smart as well as quick . now what do you have to give us ?
fame .
fame ? thank you , no . fame is the burial ground of contentment . eat it and go hungry count it and go broke seek it and grow mad . fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun .
fame is what you leave to your sons .
how did you know i had sons ?
because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for .
hah ! you do not know me , boy .
i know you .
you will follow me .
and in the few seconds before i dice you to crow food , tell me why i am going to follow you .
so your sons will speak of you to your grandsons , and your grandsons to their grandsons .
to the place where death lives .
it should be an interesting journey , then .
that i promise you .
i compel no man to follow me on this journey .
i am all right .
why do they burn the villages ? there s nothing to gain .
not sleepy , either ?
no .
those are not child s tear . a child cries for himself , a man cries for those he loves .
i knew you would not be . that is why i chose you .
we must try to get horses .
yes . it will double our range . i know at least a dozen ways to get horses . all cheap .
these we will pay for .
lad , you have an unnatural desire to pay for things . it stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination .
hand over your dinner .
a flicker of talent .
they do not exist , except in the waters of the swamp , where they will remain .
what kind of friend do you think i am ?
the best . but my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your s to it .
well , it is true that if i received a royal command i could not very well disobey it , could i ?
go . i command you .
yes , my lord .
those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men .
at the gallop !
subject to the king , no doubt .
naturally .
i intend to keep you alive , your majesty . so you can abdicate your throne and become my warlord .
perhaps . if the pay is good .
colwyn , do not be a fool . you cannot do battle with that thing .
there s no way to outrun it . you know that . this is what ynyr was preparing me for . it is what he died for .
would you settle for a boar ?
a u boar u ? those incompetent louts could not catch a piglet , much less a boar .
me . may i eat with you tonight ?
tonight and every night , my friend , for this is the second time you have saved my life . i am ergo the magnificent , short in stature , tall in power , etcetera , etcetera .
i am quell .
the swamp of betrayal . be glad we do not have to cross it .
i am glad . i am very glad .
we will meet you at the inn .
cannot i come , too ?
no .
a small house .
and what do you think a small person lives in , you one eyed fool ? leaving me here to mope while you and the boy were arranging my assassination .
i cannot go with you , my friend .
and mine goes with you .
no .
sugarballs ?
no .
what kind of a boy are you ? boys always have candy .
i have a cinnamon bar .
you do ?
you can have half .
i . . . . . . am titch .
smart lad . bring me my spices !
i would wish for a puppy .
one puppy ? why not wish for a hundred ?
i only want one .
a foolish wish . and you , quell ?
first , you desert me , and now you mock me . go back to your one eyed friend .
i do not think it is working .
not working ? this nose ? this nose works day and night . this nose has never loafed an hour in its life . this nose . . . what ? impossible . this nose asleep while venison fills the air ? where is it , boy ? tell me where it is and i forgive you everything .
it is right behind you .
and do you think i am not going to eat myself to death this very night ? huh ?
would you desert your friends ?
no , no . i am with you , boy .
get me down from here you louts or i will turn you all into pigs !
you had better manners as a pig .
i am ergo the magnificent , and i do not travel with thieves and robbers .
many villagers are hiding in the forest . they need food .
and do you think i live on air ?
we have plenty of hares .
food for crows .
surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison .
i am being exploited ! where are you going ?
i must take the old man to see some sick children . kegan will guard you .
oh , my poor stomach .
the greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life , blockhead , is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of ergo the magnificent .
your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast , magnificence .
hush !
look at its insides .
no ! not yet ! let me hug it and kiss it a little . let me run my fingers over its lovely skin . let me climb to the top and sing to it .
the forest is not safe these days . you would best travel with us .
u me u ? travel with u you u ? i am ergo the magnificent . . . . . . short in stature . . . . . . tall in power . . . . . . narrow of purpose . . . . . . wide of vision . and i do not travel with peasants and beggars . goodbye !
the one with red eyes was a dark one , the other was a cyclops , and it was not you he meant to kill .
he was aiming a huge spear right at me !
if that were so , you would be dead now . he was aiming at the dark one , for there is ancient hatred between them . once his race had two eyes , like other men , until his forefathers bargained with the dark ones they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future . but they were cheated , for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death .
and who is u he u that they should join u him u ?
he is the king .
well , at least i am glad to see you have a sense of humor . that is the first smile i have seen on that gloomy face of your s . . . . . . is not it ? it is not . oh no . oh dear . oh now i have gone and done it .
no . he will master the leader .
you know nothing of power , you foolish girl . you think power is a mighty sword , or a strong castle , or the paltry magic of an emerald seer . power is none of these .
then look !
these walls do not lie ! he will betray you .
he will not !
then he will die !
he will not come . you will be my queen .
barak is still strong in the north , and tendo holds the high passes . but the great desert forts have fallen .
freylag s stronghold ?
it has been taken , freylag and all his people slaughtered .
it is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen .
the attacks are unceasing by night , the dark ones by day , those of our people who have sold themselves to them , those traitors who are called the slayers .
it is the way of all invaders . those they would conquer they divide , buying allies with promises of land and power .
we will hold . their power is not unlimited .
modred has treated with the dark ones .
it is important to assure the succession .
yes .
i knew .
you knew ! you are a rude bumpkin !
that i am , my lady .
a match for your son , i think .
a fine match .
they will have the life that you and i might have had .
yes . we lost five .
you were lucky . i lost thirty there .
how many did you lose ?
sixty at the needle , another thirty in the forest . only ten of us made it back .
we will have to try again . his knowledge is great . without it , we cannot hope to win .
he leads a group of slayers , under the leopard banner .
such a vision will be opposed . who seeks it ?
the new king .
with an old voice ?
you know the voice .
yes . you have left your place in the needle . it is the time , then .
it is the time .
i will seek the fortress for you .
yes . it is the western ocean .
they will fail for , during the day , the power of the circle is greater than theirs . only at night can they pierce the circle .
no . they are sad , solitary creatures , rarely seen .
there s an emerald circle a few leagues from here . we will find her .
many have perished in that maze .
no maze to me , my fried . it is where we take refuge when they hunt us .
yes . like you , a king . a king of many worlds . all enslaved .
the widow of the web ?
yes .
that creature helps no one . and none who go there return .
she has the power of vision .
she has the power to kill .
perhaps she will not kill me , for i know her name .
her name is death .
she had another name once .
fewer will survive them .
each to his fate . wait for me at the inn . if i am not back by dawn , you will know my fate , and you must go on without me .
it is a hundred leagues from here .
it is not necessary . they will not follow .
yes , they are weakening . it takes great power to maintain the fortress , and they have expended much .
it is too late . he has drunk .
that is true .
ynyr !
it is fifty years since i spoke it to you .
i was beautiful then .
the most beautiful woman in the world .
but you would not stay with me .
could not . could not betray the girl to whom i was betrothed .
she was not as beautiful .
no , she was not as beautiful .
she bore you many children ?
we had no children .
you had a son .
you said nothing . you told me nothing .
you had left me ! i kept silent out of rage .
where is he ? my son .
i killed him when he was born . this place is my punishment .
it is no trickery .
those are reflections . u this u is my face !
yes .
power you have given me . what can my power give you ?
knowledge .
of what ?
the fortress of krull . when will it come near here ?
why must you know ?
there is a girl there . her name is lyssa .
you lie !
could i lie to you and still see your beauty ?
no .
a young man seeks her . a young man about the age i was when i met you .
tomorrow , the fortress of krull will rise with the sun in the valley of reeds . but the knowledge is of no use to you . no man has ever escaped the web . and soon the creature will come for you , even here .
then the other lyssa will share your fate . she will grow old in the fortress as you have grown old here .
you cannot stop time . go now , before it runs out .
you will come with me .
there is sand enough for only one life . go now , save the other .
why do you want to know ?
he forgot his money . . . my mother s got a pub , behind the corner , and he forgot his money , about .
huh ? i see , but this is the fbi , little girl , and i cannot let you in . but if you leave me his money , i will give him it myself .
ok . mister stansfield , norman stansfield .
. . . office .
yeah . . . how do you know it ?
. . . i heard he said . . . that is all . . . thanks .
no ?
she told them you wanted her things and that she was not surprised police looked for you ! can you believe it ? !
asshole . but she will not miss anything , that . you will see .
good , what are you going to do ? do you come back ?
no . . . i cannot . . . i got tired . i want to live my way .
no .
come on , shit , tell me ! is he beautiful ?
. . . what ?
well . . . did you sleep with him or not ?
no . . . not yet . he is very shy . . . and very sensitive .
. . . good . . . but that is special in him ?
. . . i do not know . . . it is true he touches me . i love him .
yeah .
huh ! ? because of the slaughter at your same floor ?
. . . not at all .
it is better . . . you see , it is my turf , so i do not want contracts i am not informed about , on my turf . i am not opposing , but the least they can do is informing me , is not it ?
yes .
dirty work , and i kill no women and no kids .
that is what i later told myself ! no , tony , forget leon ! it cannot be him , he likes too much his job to make such a slaughter !
do you need money ?
no . . . just to know . . . because it is a long time i work . . . and i never did anything with my money . . . i should do something .
pay attention to women , leon . they are dangerous , you know ?
yeah . . . well . . . i do not know . . i do not know any .
listen , think about what you want to do , but do not worry , your money is there and it is safer than in a bank . . . banks are robbed every five minutes !
i will explain you , leon they will ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you cannot write and they will ask you your job , your employer s name and you cannot tell them my job , i am a hitman and my employer is tony , his record is longer than his resturant s menu . that is why you cannot have a bank account !
well , i do not need them . . .
take them , you never know . . . if you want to have some fun . take , it is a gift .
good .
huh . . . meters ?
. . . . . .
how can you say it ?
look . when you can see his fingers , it is meters . when you just see his hands , it is about meters . when you distinguish arms from body , it is . when you see nothing more than a shape , you do not shoot . not very sure . you have one chance out of five to miss . a contract means getting all chances on your side . out of . you cannot miss a client . never . . . if the task is delicate or the risk is too big , you double . that is , you insure yourself by another means .
what , for example ?
well , if the guy is far , in a car , and i know weather is going to be bad , rain for example , i think i would plastic the car , with a remote here . i shoot from the distance and if i miss i plastic .
what if you cannot approach the car or he changes car ?
oh really ? but can you miss the car ?
yeah . . . come on , have a little training .
whoever .
perfect .
yeah , but i did not get him , i got his case and now he is behind the tree . what can i do ?
it is not serious , it is just training . you have to learn from the beginning to hit the target , then , to improve precision , you will train , but on cardboards .
ok .
now , try a running guy .
ok .
yes , yes . . .
what ?
there , the guy . . . how did you do that , without even touching him ? without noise . it is like you put him away . . . how did you do it ?
ok .
you were scared , were not you ?
i was nervous , that is all ! where is the guy ?
i killed him . . . and cut him and ate all of him . . . i left nothing for you !
how do you know it is love , if you have never been in love before ? . . . it may be friendship . . . or the love you can have with a brother or a father . . . how can you know ?
. . . because i feel it .
yes .
quick does not mean ready . and you cannot discuss , we said . right ?
no .
for musicals ? that is part of the job !
no , you cannot go out .
i hate you because you depart without kissing me . that is all .
. . . this is what i do not like , you see you do not refrain me , but at the same time i cannot get out !
why ?
too heavy .
i never rent my gear .
ok . . . and if it is you who gets killed ? . . . then ? talking about other people s death is easy , but what about yours ? she is here ! she moves around you , and can get you in a thousandth of second . because it was your day , your hour , your second . . .
and . . . may i kiss you , like in the movies , may this be an exception ?
mathilda , stop , please !
of course , so kiss me quickly , or they will notice us .
what ?
when i say i love you .
mathilda , do not resume , please . . . . . change subject , ok ?
. . . ok . i love you anyway .
mathilda ? !
ok , ok ! excuse me ! how old were you when you had your first contract ?
. . . .
what shall we do ?
i think .
piddle . she smiles and looks for the bathroom . she finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath , walkman on . she withholds a shout and gets against the wall , without moving . she does not dare passing before the open door again to join leon . in the living room , leon still thinks .
. . . why did not he close the window ?
there are better things . you see the importance of the moment . ten minutes early or late , he would have seen death . he would have suffered it . this way , he already departed . without knowing .
. . . i would like knowing what he is listening to . . .
. . . later .
that was not bullshit , i said we love each other .
yeah ! . . . anyway , i do not like hotels . too much people , everyone s got the key . . . i do not like it .
friends ? you are crazy ! in my building , before , they just cared drugs all day and you could not get one , or they just cared video games and you could not get one , no more .
you are darkening the picture , are not you ?
a little . . .
is there a normal or year old boy ?
yeah . . . there s a lot on tv .
yeah . . . i am just good for left overs !
. . . you are young , mathilda . . . you still have a chance to get out . you cannot give up this chance . you have to protect it . there s a lot of things to do in life , a lot of other jobs . . .
there are just two things i am interested in love and death . for the moment , i have none of the two !
huh , really ? what ? come on , i am waiting !
you have just to love me and i will be the happiest woman around .
yeah , i know ! but for the moment you are not yet a woman . so , be patient . . . i need time . . . and you too . you have to grow up .
i do not grow up any more . i just get older .
i love you so much , leon .
i love you too , and i do not want to lose you .
well . . . i proposed them to play roulette . . . like we played . . . . . . and i lost .
of course ! i am fine ! i put on your beautiful dress , i slightly made up . . . i tried to get beautiful ! do not you like it ?
i prefer waiting for a while . . . i feel it would go the wrong way .
. . . do not you like me ?
. . . i do not know .
well . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ? how many , approximately ?
. . . mathilda , i do not feel like talking about this .
why ? did you have too many and you fear it may shock me ? i will not get shocked . i am used to this ! my father was a true pig . he fucked the bitch i would as mother all around the apartment . whenever a door was closed , you could be sure they were making sex behind it ! and my sister , if you did not sleep with her , you are building s exception !
stop , mathilda ! do not talk like that !
then ? you did not give a shit about her father , did not you ? you met anyway ?
. . . yes . the day he got out of jail . i allowed him to make ten steps . . . no more . and bang . two hundred meters . by telescope . that night , i left my country and came here , to join my father , who worked for tony . . . . i was . then , i never left the city . . . and never had another girlfriend . . .
yes .
three times , then two times .
. . . yes .
what do you do , with the money you earn ?
nothing , for the moment .
maybe it is the time to do something , is not it ?
yeah , what ?
i do not know . . . getting far away , the two of us , for example . . . and forgetting all this . . .
it will take them five minutes ! how long ago did they arrive ?
i do not know . . . five minutes .
good ! snipers cannot be in position .
let me work . we will get out , i tell you !
mathilda , listen !
no , no ! i do not want to go ! i do not want !
not at all , mathilda ! i tell you because it is true ! you will buy the globe you told me about and you will choose , ok ? we will go where you want ! i swear , you will see , mathilda ! !
good morning , mister . . . it is danielle !
huh ! you made an error , baby . i do not know any danielle .
. . . i got lost , mister .
huh ? move back , baby , i cannot see anything .
it is not me , it is dark here . . . and i cannot find the switch .
excuse me , mister . . . i am looking for mister rubens apartment , but it is dark out here and i got lost . . .
. . . one second .
i have no fear .
fine . . .
i see . you are good , because i did not hear anything .
yeah . i put a rag on the strings , to lessen noise .
huh ? that is smart !
i am used to it . not everyone likes music .
yeah , true . but what does your father exactly do for living ?
. . . composer .
huh , that is good !
yeah , but he is not exactly my father . . .
huh ?
. . . no . . . he is my lover . . .
huh ? why ?
because you have to pay . it is like a parking meter if you stay , you pay . it is the rule . . .
. . . and how much is it ?
ten dollars . . . a month .
can i sit on the stairways now ?
huh . . . yeah , yeah . . . of course .
messina .
emilio ? due grappe ! . . . why the hell did you come here ?
yeah , but i do not give a shit about . i trade at left , at right and that is dangerous in there . . .
it is a little out of the world coming to visit me this way , on mid afternoon . it really is not the usual procedure . . .
i know . . . but i am a little pressed .
giancarlo . . . rinaldi .
yeah . . . and still in messina . he is my uncle .
huh ? are you alfredo s son , then ?
no . . . dino s .
yes . . . twice .
did you fish in messina ? the pesce spada ?
no . . .
it is a specialty down there . it is a fishing boat with , in front , a long pole near the surface . then , near the cabin , a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout .
you are right , son . you must care the links with your family , always . it is the only important thing in the world .
. . . yeah .
salute .
i respect your business , mister tony . every time we asked your help , we were very happy with the result . it is right this that makes me nervous , now . i hope you will excuse my temporary bad mood ?
then . . .
. . . even his mother would not .
may we have this wolf s name and address ?
these guys have no place . they change virtually everyday . and his name . . . it is a surname .
where ?
for a walk . i do not know .
adelle . . . maurice is in the paper .
why am i such an authority ?
here comes the resume .
i received my b . s . from the university of pennsylvania , my p . h . d . from bryn mawr college . i worked three years at the boston university school of medicine , during which time i had articles printed in the journal of educational psychology , american journal of psychology , psychology review and science . . . so i think it is safe to say my opinion is valid .
high top nike cross trainers with heel support and air cushioned soles . they are nasty .
i have new dreams now .
i do not accept that .
maybe one day after you have been married twenty years you will understand .
uncle maurice i spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here . . . i have a rented car outside , just listen to me . come back with me now , and if you still want to do something like this in a year maybe we will plan a car trip across the country gerald and i will come along
i have to walk by myself all the way every inch .
it is impossible .
it is what she asked for . . . it is what i am going to do .
she was being symbolic . what if she asked you to fly to the moon ?
you would be visiting me at nasa .
i will make it .
if you really want to do this . . . plan it out . rest up . train for it . build up your body . plan every stop along the way . how much money ? time ? really do it properly . this is all so by the seat of your pants .
no it is not .
why did you take the back roads here ? they are not safe . you would know that if you would planned .
if you cannot redo these six hundred miles when you are rested and ready , how are you possible going to walk another two thousand five hundred miles in your present condition ?
uncle , the way i was told , if that police car did not happen down that road , you would be dead right now . that guy denny , had jumped bail in another state , he is dangerous . . . they will be other dennys , if you do not plan .
maybe later .
you should definitely have children . they are really special .
how serious is it ?
what ?
i finish the walk , and then we may take all the chances we want .
i am completing the walk . i am almost there .
i will not let you die .
put out a p . b . s . . . . or whatever it is called .
a . p . b . . . . he is not breaking any law . he is a grown man . . . he can crawl on his hands and knees to china if that is what he wants to do .
sergeant , i am a psychologist and i know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems . . . my uncle lost his wife and it devastated him .
we are very sorry about that . some of our men were on the scene of the accident .
i think my uncle is suffering from a condition called mania which is linked with depression . it is a time when an individual will act over confident , and will act out impractical , grandiose plans . sometimes these plans can be dangerous .
how long does this . . . mania last ?
a couple days to a few months if untreated .
thank you .
do not wait by the phone . if he is really been walking this whole time , he is out of our jurisdiction . . .
are you and your friends planning on driving soon ?
no , i just do not want anybody dying because i did not say something when i had the chance .
you need a ride , preacher ?
that is enough .
i will kill you !
can it kill me ?
it can , but it will have to wait in line .
we operate . we find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding . . . i just did this procedure on a senator and he is doing fine .
what are the odds ? do i have a fifty fifty chance of surviving the operation ?
it is hard to say . it is a delicate surgery . there s no getting around the fact that it is a very high risk situation .
pardon ?
i mean why the sudden voluntary visit usually it takes gun point to get you in here . . .
routine , i assure you . i just wanted to gage my health . am i healthy ?
yes you are .
i am going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar .
you do ?
i have seen it before .
you have ?
you are feeling old and you want to start exercising . a lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth . do not feel embarrassed about it .
okay .
you should start slow and easy fifteen minutes a day .
no . how far in one attempt that is the farthest someone like myself could walk ?
i do not know maybe twenty miles . . . of course i am not recommending that . . . if someone like you had to i mean . . . that is how far they would probably get before encountering serious physical walls .
twenty miles ? i see .
the flowers . . . they are beautiful .
there was no card .
it is just a regular day .
well , i am sure it is not christmas , because you would be worried about how much money we do not have to spend on each other . . . i know it is not new years , because you would be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you do not like to dance . . . and i am sure it is not our anniversary , because i did not find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says , pick out something pretty . . . yes maurice i am virtually certain it is not a special day today .
what ?
the new store ?
honey , i told you . if it makes you happy , we should just do it .
it is a tremendous amount of work moving .
we can do it together .
that is that ? that is not a fortune . . . you will be rich . . . that is a fortune . what you have is a statement .
what it is is the truth .
i do not follow .
sometimes people need to see things done for them because sooner or later they do not believe the words anymore .
you do not think i love you ?
yes .
anything ?
what do you want from me ? would i swim across an ocean for you ? . . . would i walk across the united states for you ? yes . . . yes i would . you know that .
no i do not . i do not even know if you would walk across the street for me .
you are talking to me ?
why do you polish it ?
why are you polishing it in bed in your pajamas at at night ? are you going to show it to someone ?
no .
then why ?
there s no reason .
exactly . no reason . no occasion . it just makes you feel good to do something for it , to express your pride and affection for it some how . . . how come you would do that for a piece of metal and not for me ?
show me .
i will i promise .
you like to take walks ?
no . but i want to take a walk with you .
please tell me .
i have changed my mind .
you cannot change your mind .
you have just decided , is that right ?
yes .
please not , the two kinds of people speech .
. . . people that were made to be parents , and people who were not made to be parents . . . my parents , were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway . i do not want us to be that way ellen .
you can change .
face it ellen , i am not the type of person who reads bedtime stories . but you love me anyway .
do not be so sure .
do not bring it in here it probably has all kinds of diseases .
it will make it .
he is plastered .
that is okay really it is .
no it is not . he should be here with me now , not trying to find some fucking bottle of johnny walker . he is never been there for me . i have always been alone .
i think it is a different place for each person .
did you have a dream ?
where ?
pacifica , california .
when i was ten , my family lived in pacifica for a year . i used to go to the beach everyday that summer . i never felt so happy , carefree . it was a magic place for me . . . that is where my heaven will be .
yes .
if i die , you will know where to look for me ?
go to sleep ellen .
no really , if god takes us away from each other , you know where to look now ?
good .
if i had seen you . by the way i am sorry about your wife . they told me .
thank you . . . i am sorry you had to lie . it must have been difficult .
i asked the officers if you had committed some crime . . . if they had said yes , you would be speaking with them right now .
pacifica , california .
from where ?
philadelphia , pennsylvania .
i see .
do you believe a persongs soul lives on after their death ?
most certainly .
and that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them .
that is a reasonable assumption .
i do not want my wife s soul having any doubts .
doubts ? about what ?
about my love for her .
i am not proving to her . i am showing her . and i know i do not have to . i want to . i have realized , love is about giving . i am alive , i can still give to her . i want to give her everything i can .
his name is maurice . he is dancing around everything else .
red flag , man .
if he is in trouble with the law fine . not our problem . he yanked two people from a car wreck , let s give him some space .
not our problem .
why so vague ? why so evasive ? he could be somebody hot .
not our problem .
it is going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the steadmangs house .
this guy s not a murderer .
if he is , half the town has seen us take him out for dinner like a couple of jack asses .
maurice and ellen parker . . . it was issued in philly . . . mr . maurice parker has come a long way from home . why ?
p a r k e r . right . get on the horn with philly . call me here .
that is all right is not it ?
jumped where ?
out of the car . he jumped out of the god damn car !
i am isaac . . . i am three .
i am maurice parker . . . i am much older than three . are your parents home ?
is that right ?
you know what . . . i am just little now , but i will be big soon .
you will probably be bigger than your brothers .
yeah !
you know what . . . i remembered you were here and i woke up .
you tell stories ?
oh no . . . i am not good at that . very bad in fact . . .
you know what . . . maybe i ran onto the field and hit a home run .
who s telling this story ?
that is me .
right . but everyone saw how small isaac was and laughed . . . but not big billy . he stared at isaac carefully and then told him to join the game . it came to the end of the game . it was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game . . .
nine .
okay nine . big billy s team was losing and he was on base . that is when isaac came up . he could barely hold the bat . . . big billy winked at isaac . . . the ball was pitched isaac hit the ball hard . it soared up and out over the stadium . everyone cheered . isaac hit a home run and won the game . after the game , isaac asked big billy why he let he play . big billy smiled and said , i was not always big billy , i was little billy first . . . isaac and big billy went off after the game and read a classic book together . the end .
you know what that was a really good story . . . tell it again .
making the grand total ?
damn baby , relax . i am getting to it . from philadelphia following the route highlighted to pacifica california you are traveling an estimated three thousand two hundred miles . . .
what was that ?
perhaps there s another route ?
this is the route approved by triple a . even if you followed back roads the entire way , you would still be looking at roughly the same distance . . .
by car right ?
mammoth .
the gazette s small huh ?
umm , no . it is just that
god damn , you are right . . . you do not say much michelle , but what you say is golden .
umm , coalville utah .
maybe .
you are amazing .
it has to be a full character s name .
they called her lizy in the book . . . sorry i was late . my jeep died on the way over from the paper .
they printed your article on , wouldry verses can dog food . . . very enlightening .
pulitzer , here i come .
never have children . if they are not a burden to you , they are a burden to someone else .
to reach people , you have to feel something first . . . you write about the wrong things . how can you feel for dog food ? the people at the gazette do not respect it , and neither do you .
this is a ghost town . nothing ever happens .
write from your heart . that is why the classics are great .
no . no . . . i will not be here for a while . the store will be closed in the interim .
yes .
where ?
california .
tomorrow .
walking where ?
california .
i always knew you had good instincts . . . goodbye kris . i will see you when i get back .
. . . round the world in eighty days . . . . hello kris .
you are amazing . . . what are you doing mr . parker ?
i told you .
pacifica , california it is a coastal city .
oh , a coastal city . that is good .
she knew you loved her .
she was not certain . . . i never really showed her .
i said , i would do anything for her . . . and she did not believe me . i said , i would walk across the country for her . . . she did not believe me .
why know ?
because i should have shown her before . . . everyday , i should have shown her .
so i have been informed .
what mr . parker ?
she never ate a slice .
. . . the grapes of wrath .
you are amazing .
i missed you to mr . parker .
adelle told me , your writing is going well . the crusader for social issues and all .
you were right . from the heart is always better .
i was thinking you could open another store with investors . i am sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now .
saluting .
what , come on ?
i cannot do it . i want you to finish , but i want you to live more .
i do .
why in god s name did you fly all the way here then ?
do not do this .
. . . to look me in the eye and say that is important to you is not as important to me ? to tell me you know that is best ? to tell me life is more precious than what i feel for my wife ?
it is mine to risk .
no more words . until i touch the ocean with my hands . . . it is all just words .
where am i ?
in a hospital .
which hospital ? did you take me back ?
steph .
do you have a car , steph ?
i need your help .
they told me , you might try to talk me into something . . . you need to rest mr . parker . . . it is for your own good . i have been following your story for a long while . it is a beautiful thing you did .
you ever lose somebody stephanie ?
mr . parker , i am supposed to give you your fish sticks .
did you tell him everything you wanted to ? did you do everything you could while he was here ?
someone should be with you .
good morning .
oh , that is not mine .
you should . children are a blessing from god . i have four .
forty seven years .
he is getting my sweater from the car . i said there was a breeze . i told him not to go .
yes .
hello .
how are you feeling ?
confused . i am not sure what to do now . i am not sure what he wants for me .
he wants to reward you . . . that is why i am here .
what do you mean ?
i mean you have done a great thing . you should be rewarded monetarily .
what ? who are you ?
evening news ?
we did a piece after your story ran in the new york times .
it is yours .
no . i will not take it unless i pay for it . . . let s see , that is a pretty nice watch i can see that .
this is not right .
this is my only chance to get a watch like that . it would mean a lot to me and my family . please take it . it really is not that much .
yes , i heard , and it is not a problem .
what do you want ?
what are my choices ?
everything s ten dollars , and there s no alcohol .
no alcohol ?

that is funny . i wonder if you will take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me ?
maybe you should not stand in the road like that . you are pretty drunk .
not really . my room s not far . the whole year inn . you can drive with me if you want . . .
no s . e . r . a .
we can go to one if you would prefer .
no , this is fine . i was just wondering .
right , i will get your door . i tend to fade in and out lately .
i guess i do too .
you what ?
i sometimes fade out .
oh . . . well , maybe we better synchronize our spells . . . or stagger them .
you were going to get my door .
of course .
a shot of tequila , if you can spare it .
of course .
maybe another drink first . more tequila ?
ok . . . whatever .
i do not care about that . there s time left . you can have more money . you can drink all you want . you can talk or listen . just stay , that is all i want .
to death ?
yes , that is right .
how long s it gonna take , for you to drink yourself to death ?
i think about four weeks , and i have got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day .
yes . . . that should do it . what am i ? a luxury ?
yeah . and your meter just ran out .
no , just drunk . . . but that is ok . where is your car ?
i sold it this morning . i am going to take cabs from now on in .
why should i ? i know you are not a cop , so what is it tonight ? another two fifty to watch you sleep ?
i was looking for you tonight . i do not know if you have a boyfriend . . .
are you serious .
i think you know i am serious . i will pay you if you like . . . but i would like to see you .
no , i cannot have dinner with you .
i have to change and take a shower first . if you want to come home and wait .
you do ?
you ok out there ?
yes . take your time . i am fine .
of course . wow . . . you look extremely beautiful .
thank you . what time is it ?
do not know . my watch went the way of the car .
i like hearing you talk . if you feel up to a short walk , there s a place to eat around the corner . all the food in vegas is terrible so the place does not really matter . how does that sound to you ?
do they have drinks ?
is that really what you want to ask me ?
yes .
well , then i guess this is our first date . . . or our last . until now , i was not sure it was either .
very clever .
interesting choice of words . i do not remember . i just know that i want to .
want to kill yourself ? are you saying that you are drinking as a way to kill yourself ?
what are you thinking ? are you angry with me ?
ben , why do not you stay at my place tonight ? i mean . . . look , you are so drunk . i like you . i trust you .
that is astonishing . sera , look . . .
i hate to think of you in that cheesy motel . i mean . . .
i am going to move to a smart hotel , tomorrow if it will make you feel better . let s talk about tomorrow . wanna do something ?
sure . . . tonight . then please stay at my place .
sera . . . you know i am not much good in the sack .
it is not about sex , ben . i will make you up a bed on the sofa . do it for me . we can talk till late and then sleep till late . as you know , i am my own boss .
three nights , two days . when is your rent coming up at the motel ?
i do not know . i will go and sort it out today . why do not you come ? . . . we will find a real room for me . you can pick it out , a tower on the strip .
there s no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room .
what do you mean ?
what i mean is that you should bring your stuff over here . we are spending all this time together . . . what the fuck !
sera . . .
let s face it , ben , we are having fun here . i have never done so much talking in my life .
me neither .
so ! let s dispense with the formalities . i want you here . . . now !
sera you are crazy .
so . . . i am not too concerned with long term plans .
do not you think you will get a little bored living with a drunk ?
that is what i want . why do not you go and get your stuff ?
you have not seen the worst of it . these last few days i have been very controlled . i knock things over . . . i throw up all the time . now i feel really good . . . you are like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance , but that will not last forever . you will get tired of it really quickly . believe me .
do not be silly ?
what ?
i do . i really do . ok . i have to do some shopping alone . you go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things . do not hurry and i will be back before you to let you in .
why do not you go in and sit down . i have some gifts for you .
right . . . ok . . .
seriously , ben . . . i need to keep pretty low key around here . maybe next time you could nap this side of the door . that was the landlord .
of course .
sorry .
ok .
i have come this far . . . here i am , in your house . i want you to let me pay the rent for this month . all right ?
because . . . it is better for me that way . ok ?
well . . . ok . . .
no ?
no . i think you are talking about you . i will tell you right now that i am in love with you . . . but , be that as it may , i am not here to force my twisted life into your soul .
i know that . . .
. . . and i am not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life . we know i am a drunk . . . but that seems to be all right with you . and i know that you are a hooker . i hope you understand that i am a person who is totally at ease with this . . . which is not to say that i am indifferent or that i do not care . . . i do . . . it simply means that i trust and accept your judgement . what i am saying is . . . that i hope you understand that i understand .
thanks , i do understand . i was worried about how that would be . . . but now i am not . and you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job .
ah , yes . . . i suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck .
whatever that means . open your presents .
i threw them into the garbage , which was perhaps immoral , but i wanted to come to you clean , so to speak . i thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day .
nice talk , ben . keep drinking . in between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool , some interesting words fall from your mouth .
do you want to go gambling tonight ? we could go out and play for a few hours .
then come . i am going to change . watch tv . i will be half an hour .
when ?
tomorrow night as a matter of fact .
well , then . . . i hope we do not run into any tonight .
what do you mean ?
i expect some kind of loyalty here . just because i fuck for money does not give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly .
very well . . . umm . . . i never expected to have to ask you this again . . . but how did our evening go ? i remember getting to the casino . . . i remember kissing you . . . that was really nice but everything after that is a blank .
well i was prepared for worse , but it was not so bad . we were sitting at the bar , talking about blackjack . you seemed just fine , a little drunker than usual , but nothing really strange , but then your head started to droop and i put my arm on your shoulder and then , wham , you swung you arm at me , and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress . you smashed everything on her tray , it was a real mess . you kept yelling and yelling .
oh , and what did you do ?
i tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me not like you wanted to hit me , but more just waving me away . security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling . they wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street , but i talked them into letting me walk you out .
that is impressive . how did you do that ?
i told them you were an alcoholic and i would take you home . i also promised that we would never come in there again .
we ?
i warned you . . . . . . but i am sorry .
here s my speech . . . . . . i know this should not be acceptable to me , but it is . do not ask me why . i sense that your trouble is very big . . . and i am scared for you . . . and so i am doing what i think you need me to do . falling down in casinos is little stuff . it does not bother me . it has nothing to do with us .
that is amazing . what are you ? some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies ? how can you be so good ?
be careful .
ok , but remember that they wear it because they have to . i wear it because i want to . that will make me look different . let s get a drink .
i think you should wear one at a time . one of these . . . and one of your others . in fact , i was going to buy just one , but i did not think it would fly . . . as a gift , i mean .
can we just forget it ?
i do not understand any of that .
can we just ignore it ?
yes . . . i will give you that .
thank you , sera .
do you want me not to go tonight ?
no . . . we already talked about that .
they would not know .
you be careful to . i am going to miss you .
shall we go away for a couple of days ?
yeah . . . i would like that .
last spring i happened to walk past a house that i had once patronized . there was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window i could see a bare leg . the girl must have been taking a break between customers . it was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that i was late for something already i just stayed there , loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and . . . the reason i am telling you this epilogue is that i felt that i would come full circle .
where was that house ? the one in la , i mean .
fifth and mayflower . you know it ?
yes . one of my friends was there . i wonder if you ever clipped her .
let s stay for a while .
ok .
i did not know i would ever need it again .
and do what . . . rot away in a room ? we are not going to talk about that . fuck you ! i will not talk about that . you are staying here . you are not moving to a hotel .
will you lighten up , please ?
one thing . . . one thing . . . this is one thing you can do for me . i have given you gallons of free will here ! you can do this for me .
yes . . . i guess i knew that .
oh , ben . . . you look so very sick . . . my love . . . you are so pale .
yes .
hey ben . there were a couple of guys looking for you .
what did they look like ?
suits . i did not tell them anything . you know anything about gears ?
i was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up .
the news is not good , kid . this bit here . . . see there . . . it is broken . you need a new one .
how much , do you think ?
i do not know . i will find out though .
yes , that would be great . are you her for the convention ?
do i look that obvious ? my name s paul .
alone . alone . i am here alone .
where are you staying ?
right here at the hotel . why ?
well . . . i thought you might be looking for a date .
a date . what , are you a hooker ? what do you mean a date ? i have got a wife back home . i just came over to talk for a few minutes .
i am sorry , i guess i misunderstood .
sorry . look . . . you seem like a nice girl . i am just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money .
i want this , sera . i need this !
please , yuri .
i have been all right .
i will keep you safe . we are both older .
i am lonely , yuri .
where have you been staying ?
with an old friend .
yes , of course . how much do you need ?
all of it . i need to buy many things . . . all of it !
it was a slow night . i went to a hotel for a few drinks .
like i said . . . it was a slow night . . . i am sorry . it was hard to score .
what do you think . . . you are sixteen years old on hollywood boulevard ?
it is me , yuri .
no .
yuri . . . are you . . .
sera . . . please go .
that is right .
but it is a top three school
i have a . .
yes , but your major is fashion merchandising . harvard will not be impressed that you aced history of lycra . what are your backups ?
i do not need backups . harvard is the school i am going to .
i once had to judge a theta chi tighty whitey contest . trust me i can handle anything .
i cannot tell you .
you understand you are on trial for murder ?
i did not do it ! i walked in , saw my husband lying on the floor , bent down to check his heart , screamed my head off and chutney and enrique ran inside .
where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood .
insurance ? a love affair ? pure unadulterated hatred ? believe me , the da will come up with plenty of reasons .
i loved him !
he was thirty four years older than you . that does not sound so good to a jury .
i cannot give you that . and if you put me on the stand , i will lie .
go to hell .
i will take that as a no .
are we done for today ?
i believe we are .
get up .
what ?
you are fired . i have new representation .
who ?
he is the top defense attorney in the state . of course he is an ass .
but is he an ass that is gonna win my case ?
he is an ass that is gonna try .
he thinks i am guilty , does not he ?
that is not that is important .
to me it is . he does not trust me . why should i trust him ?
you took my class in la . you had the best high kick i have ever seen . are you one of my lawyers ?
sort of .
i am glad it is you and not donovan .
he means well . he is really brilliant and all .
who could better understand than me ?
whatever it is it could save you .
that is just it it would ruin me !
how ?
i know ! you helped me go from a six to a four !
i am a fraud ! but it is not like normal people can have this ass ! if my fans knew , i would lose everything . i have already lost my husband . i rather be in jail then lose my reputation !
i believe you ! do not worry .
enrique s gay . i am sure of it .
he did leave a cher tape in the pool house once
did she have a weapon in her hand ?
no .
was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon ?
uh , yeah , because the bitch shot him .
was there any evidence that mrs . windham shot him ?
his dead body with a bullet in it .
not that i saw . but like i said , i went straight upstairs to take a shower .
and when you came downstairs , what happened ?
i saw brooke standing over his body , drenched in his blood .
but mrs . windham did not have a gun ?
no , she would stashed it by then .
no . i was in the shower .
so at some point in the twenty minutes you were in the shower , your father was shot ?
i guess .
yes . i was washing my hair .
i got up , went to starbucks , went to the gym , got a perm , and came home .
where you got in the shower .
yes .
yes .
two a year since i was twelve . you do the math .
you know , a girl in my sorority , tracy marcinko , got a perm once . even though we all told her not to . curls really were not the right look for her she did not have your bone structure .
because they got wet .
that is right . because is not the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de activating the ammonium thiglycolate ?
she is younger than i am . did she tell you that ? how would you feel if your father married someone younger than you ?
you , however , had time to hide the gun , did not you , chutney ? after you shot your father ?
who s asking ?
i am elle woods . ms . bonafante s attorney .
due to the fact that you retained the residence , ms . bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately .
huh ?
tell him , paulette .
that is touching , elle , but we need an alibi .
yes . but i cannot tell you what it is .
i promised her i would keep it secret . i cannot break the bonds of sisterhood !
he is gay he is not brooke s lover ! he is making it up . whoever killed heyworth is paying him off .
thank you !
is everything okay ?
you followed your intuition today and you were right on target . i should have listened .
thank you .
about the alibi
i am impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it . that is what makes a good lawyer . and on top of that , you gained the client s trust and kept it . that is what makes a great lawyer . you are smart , elle . smarter than most of the guys i have on my payroll .
not really . i know how competitive it all is
you are a beautiful girl , elle .
so everything you just said
i am a man who knows what i want .
yes , i am .
but you agreed last night . in the office ? when we were discussing my career ?
i saw mrs . windham standing over the body of mr . windham .
was she carrying a weapon ?
no , she was crying her eyes out .
oh , yes . mrs . windham is the most sweet , wonderful woman i know . i have loved her since the day she hired me . she could never do something this awful . i know this because we are very close .
just the love in my heart .
donovangs firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he is taking on first year interns .
he chose them already ?
what ?
we spend a beautiful night together and then i never hear from you again ?
uh
for what ? breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man ?
uh both ?
forget it . i have already spent too many hours crying over you .
see ?
aristotle .
would you be willing to stake your life on it ?
i think so . . .
how about
i do not know .
well , i recommend knowing before speaking . the law leaves much room for interpretation but very little for self doubt .
spill .
well , what am i supposed to do ? he is engaged ! she is got the family six carat on her bony , unpolished finger .
you are asking the wrong girl . i am with my guy eight years and then one day it is i met someone else . move out .
what would you do ?
cried a lot and gained twenty pounds . dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby rufus . i got jackcrap .
no !
what could i do ? he is a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures . i am a middle aged high school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass . happens every day . at least to women like me .
that is terrible !
so , that is this sarah got that you do not ? three tits ?
she is from connecticut . she belongs to his stupid country club .
is she as pretty as you ?
she could use some mascara and some serious highlights , but she is not completely unfortunate looking .
definitely ! i love him !
i could not help it ! it was the most fun i have had since i have been in law school . not only was i good enough for warner i was better than him . he has to see serious i am now . even donovan was impressed , and he is a total hard ass .
no .
yes , you are . go you can do this .
look at him . he is still scratching his head .
which must be a nice vacation for his balls . . .
that is because men are big , fat retards who do not oh , my god . . .
no . sometimes i say okay instead of fine .
have you ever considered asking him if he would like a cold beverage ? or perhaps a neck massage ?
that is the point ? look at me .
i am . and i am looking at a beautiful , fabulous , sexy woman .
trust me . you have got the equipment , you just need to read the manual .
i am so happy for you !
how would it go at the trial ?
great . donovan actually said the words good work , ms . woods . he takes me seriously ! can you believe it ?
of course i can believe it . you are going to make a great lawyer .
that is the point of staying ? all people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs . no one s ever going to take me seriously . the people at law school do not , warner does not i do not even think my parents take me seriously . they wanted me to grow up and become a victoria s secret model who marries a rock star . now , for the first time , it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living . but i was kidding myself donovan did not see me as a lawyer . he saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else . it turns out , i am a joke .
licensed attorney or family member ?
uh family .
relation ?
i am her sister .
name ?
delta . gamma .
you know her ?
oh , god , was this like an rsvp thing ?
although mr . huntington makes an excellent point , i have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life ?
too bad you and i are the only ones .
i am still cannot believe you did not tell donovan the alibi .
i know . i thought that was very classy of you .
really ? thanks .
i know . he has it sent out .
did you know he got wait listed when he applied ? his father had to make a call .
you are kidding !
really ?
he is already got his coffee maybe he needs a donut .
what ?
maybe you should sleep with the judge too . then we can win the case .
yes , you are .
and donovangs a scumbag for coming on to you .
yes , he is .
hell , yes . we have got finals to study for . in jamaica .
you guys are so sweet !
you think ?
i think you should go with red . it is the color of confidence .
well , i do not want to look like i know that is coming . . .
why else would he be taking you to the ivy ? you have been dating for a year it is not like he is trying to impress you .
serious ? ! who the hell does he think he is ? you are the most popular month on the usc calendar !
thank you . i love you , too .
so ?
but is not it kind of hard to get into law school ?
i have the highest gpa in delta gamma !
your scrunchie ?
my lucky scrunchie . it helped me pass spanish .
why , yes , margot , i do . once again , we joined hope in the search for her identity . as you know , she is been brainwashed by the evil stefano
power yoga ?
picking out my wedding dress !
what ? !
josh proposed !
no way
i will . . .
margot !
i cannot believe you guys are actually here but this case is important . i will make it up to you after finals , okay ? i promise . i really want to do a good job .
not yet .
the professors ? yeah , they tend to do that . socratic method .
and if you do not know the answer , they just kick you out ?
did she do that to you , too ?
no , but she made me cry once . not in class i waited until i got to my room , but yeah , she can pretty much shrivel your balls or you know , your whatevers .
neat .
do not worry . it gets better . who else do you have ?
speak up in donovangs class . he likes people with an opinion . sit in the back for royalton . he tends to spit when he talks about products liability .
wow . i am glad i met you .
thanks again for your help !
i was not gonna
my money s on the angry daughter or the ex wife .
uh , for starters , she will not give us an alibi
aside from that .
she is completely untrustworthy .
why ?
she married an old man , she is made a living on telling women they are too fat , she hawks her crap on the home shopping network . . .
a he is an old man with a really big penis . b she never told me i was fat . and c victoria principal sells on that network .
and d brooke is obviously hiding something .
but maybe it is not what you think .
but maybe it is
how do you figure ?
because people are not always what they seem to be and you refuse to see that . have a little faith . you might be surprised .
maybe not to your face . . .
no , she cannot move for an hour .
we are here from austen , platt , jaret donovan
did your daughter ever say anything to you about brooke and heyworth s relationship ?
you are going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment ? she is ly ing .
and you know this for a fact ?
did you see the icky black color of her hair ?
so ?
i never trust a woman who s not blonde . except for my friend serena , but that is only because she is a blonde at heart . that is the whole reason i am starting the blonde legal defense fund .
blondes are discriminated against worldwide ! brooke s a blonde , and people are saying she is sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband . if she was a mousy brunette , it would be , oh , the poor widow .
you are serious ?
it would be a full service law firm , by and for blondes , providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas . i mean , think about it name one blonde intellectual role model .
i cannot .
that is a direct result of anti blonde discrimination !
wait hilary clinton .
if she were a true blonde , she would have left the cheating bastard . blondes do not let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it .
exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty year old man can take ?
that is not really a topic that keeps me up at night but maybe it should .
the bags under your eyes . you are an attractive man , but you need to take better care of yourself .
i do not do that stuff .
well , you should if you look good , you feel good and if you feel good , you project joy into the world .
projecting joy is not my job .
fine . sorry i brought it up .
for a butt head ? yes .
what ? !
gay men know designers . straight men do not .
i am quitting .
law school was a mistake . getting this internship was a mistake .
what are you talking about ? you earned it
going back to la . maybe i can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the swedish bikini team . no more navy blue suits . no more panty hose . no more trying to be something i am not .
what if you are trying to be something you are ? the hell with donovan . stay .
oh , my god ! !
are you asking me on a date ?
as long as you realize i am not just some man toy you can show off like a trophy .
then , forget it . besides , i have an early class tomorrow .
so friday at eight ?
is he the only one ?
what do you think ?
helloo . . . he just had lunch with his grandmother . you know he got the rock .
i am canceling the mixer . we will blacklist sigma chi .
thank you , serena , but i do not think it will do any good .
what happened ?
i just do not understand what went wrong
i do not know ! i do not know anything any more ! i just need to be by myself .
are you sure ?
what , like on va kay ?
absolutely !
well , hurry up so you can come home ! we miss you !
i miss you guys ! the people here are so vile ! hardly anyone even talks to me unless it is to say something that is not nice . law school sucks !
oh , my god ! i completely forgot to tell you !
what ?
i got bangs !
really
we are on our way to the bridal show in new york so we thought we would rescue you from law school for the night .
where is warner ?
i cannot believe you are a laker girl !
why not ?
i would rather have a client who s innocent .
i changed my mind . i would pick the dangerous one .
you are applying for my internship , are not you ?
i do not know
you should . do you have a resume ?
i do .
and engraved . . . gives it that extra little something , does not it ? see you tomorrow !
she was a delta gamma ! not in my pledge class or anything she graduated five years ahead of me . but i used to take her class at the la sports club . she is amazing !
she could make you drop three pounds in one class . she is completely gifted !
well , in all likelihood , she is completely guilty as well . she was seen standing over her husband s dead body .
maybe she found him like that .
that is the story she will be telling the jury . we just have to prove it .
of course , i do !
has warner huntington checked in yet ?
uh , no . maybe you should try the lido deck .
your what ?
you know mixers , formals , beach trips .
there s a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes . does that count ?
i guess it will have to . . .
so are you !
i mean , we are having a lot of fun now but things are gonna be different when i am at harvard . law school is a completely different world . i need to be serious .
of course .
my family expects a lot from me . and i expect a lot from me . i plan on running for office some day .
and i fully support that .
but the thing is , if i am gonna be a senator by the time i am thirty i cannot keep dicking around .
i completely agree .
that is why i think it is time for us to
you are breaking up with me ? ! i thought you were proposing .
proposing ? ! elle , if i am going to be a politician , i need to marry a jackie , not a marilyn .
you are breaking up with me because i am too blonde ?
that is not entirely
then what ? my boobs are too big ?
elle no your boobs are fine
no .
elle it is twenty miles back to campus .
how can it be the right thing if we are not together ?
i have to think about my future . and what people expect from me .
so you are breaking up with me because you are afraid your family will not like me ? everybody likes me !
east coast people are different .
just because i am not a vanderbilt , all of a sudden i am white trash ? i grew up in bel air , warner ! across the street from aaron spelling ! i think most people would agree that is way better than a vanderbilt
i told you , elle . i need someone serious .
i am seriously in love with you is not that enough ?
no , silly . i go here .
you go where ?
harvard . law school .
you got into harvard law ?
what , like it is that hard ?
uh sure .
fine . except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my civ pro professor . but no biggie . you are here now . how was your summer ?
do anything exciting ?
sarah was my girlfriend at prep school . we got back together over the summer at my grandmother s birthday party .
thank you . having fun ?
now i am .
i feel like we have barely spent any time together since we got here .
that is because i spend all my time with case studies and hypos .
tell me about it . i cannot imagine doing all this and donovangs internship next year .
elle , c mon , there s no way you will get the grades to qualify for one of those spots . you are not smart enough .
am i on glue , or did i not get into the same law school you did , warner ?
well , yeah , but
but what ? we took the same lsat , we take the same classes
i just do not want to see you get your hopes up . you know how you get .
thank you .
i gave her my word , warner .
see ?
how was i supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on ?
really ?
are you serious ?
huh . imagine that . looks like i am .
yes .
where ?
a restaurant in oakland . where no one would recognize us .
and how long have you been sleeping with mrs . windham ?
three months .
and what is your boyfriend s name ?
chuck .
i am covered in very expensive egyptian mud hardly naked .
well , that is what we are trying to prove did not happen . do you have any reason to believe it did ?
i never met the woman , but from what my daughter tells me , she is quite the cun
i m sure that was very awkward for chutney . much as it is for me , hearing you tell about it .
but i guess it was not enough for brooke .
why do you say that ?
have not you seen the cabana boy ?
i did not stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth , but i would bet my next check that that is where he was about to put it .
where is the rock ?
it is not a theta
helloo . . . you let him have anal sex with you . helloo . . . you let him videotape you diddling yourself .
you are right . phew !
cunnilingus ?
wait cecil has a condo in tahoe . let s go there !
i mean , i know you are upset and all , but cannot you just take a sedative ?
yeah , luckily .
pull up next to him !
faith .
precisely . faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant .
then we smash em ?
anything left for smashing you may happily smash .
i have something far more pleasant awaiting me .
nay . this is a private affair , no audience welcome . . . better you watch the dismantling of our enemies . . . and , look you , see the moat is set aflame .
fire moat . . . why do that ?
purely a precaution . . .
delusion . . . a kind of magic which works against the magician .
always .
we go out , smash em now ?
no . smashing is not required . i have a surprise for our tiny invaders . . . raise that hatch !
i doubt the faeries will admire their beauty . . . come , this will be fun to watch .
indeed , the best of fun . . . enjoy yourselves .
this is another victory , my friends . what began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress .
you go to lady now ?
to finish last evening s delightful work .
what do you want with me ?
your love .
your words sting more sharply than your whip .
i speak of love , and you think only of the lash .
you are cruel ! your heartless jesting worse than torture ! how can you speak of love when you see what i am !
i like well what i see . it pleases me .
but i am hideous !
you are magnificent .
grotesque . . . monstrous . . .
on the contrary ! the puling , pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting . now you are splendid . . . a fierce goddess . . . the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful .
you lie ! you wish to humiliate me , as if the form i am forced to bear were not punishment enough !
you should glory in your animal nature . it is your triumph ! none know that better than i !
not from me , surely . . .
you . . . you are a beast !
we are all of us beasts , my dear . only most are afraid to show it .
and you . . . are you not also afraid ?
i am afraid of nothing .
then why hide behind a mask ? you are ashamed !
i know no more of shame than i do of fear . i wear this mask not for concealment but protection .
protection ?
i am a creature of darkness . i require the shadow s solace and the black of night . . . sunlight is abhorrent to me . . . i cover myself completely whenever i venture forth in daylight . . . sunshine is my destroyer .
like some vile toadstool .
i prefer to think , more like the sagacious owl .
do you feed on mice and rats ?
i prefer a plump capon , but will happily serve you rats if they are to your liking .
why have you brought me here ?
to be my bride , of course .
i would soon die .
we are both of us damned , my beauty .
do it now !
no . now is the time for discipline . some lessons in obedience for the future baroness .
too bad your precious jack cannot hear you . . . the damsel in distress . . . a rescue attempt would be most amusing . . . we could flay sweet jack alive as an after dinner entertainment . . .
kill me . . . i want . . . so nice . . .
why should i kill you ? a simple course in etiquette . . . something your parents sadly overlooked .
i can keep a victim alive for weeks . . . months , if i desire it . . . it is an art . they beg for death . . . i keep it just out of their reach . the pain remains constant .
do not please . . . i will do what you desire . . .
what do you want from me ?
at the moment , very little . your company at my table . . .
oh , yes . . .
a few day s nourishment will see your strength returning .
and then ?
yes ?
what will become of me then ?
when you are ripe for my pleasure , i will enjoy the harvest .
i see . . .
i am pleased you are not troubled by the prospect . . .
do as you wish with my body , you will never possess my soul !
your soul . . . ? why should i bother with such a paltry trifle ?
i do not expect you would understand .
my dear princess , the human soul is a highly elusive commodity . i suggest you spend some hours before the glass . contemplate your intriguing reflection and consider whether such a creature as yourself could possibly possess something as fine and beautiful as a soul .
indeed i am , my dear . . . that makes us a pair !
it is nothing . my men take great delight in routing the enemy . do not trouble yourself , beauty .
it sounded like it came from the courtyard .
from the parapets most likely . the men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving .
might we watch , too ?
later , beloved . . . now i wish only to be with you . . .
pleasure is for those who seize it ! do you think those insipid , pale skinned mortals will ever know such rapture ?
it is odd . . . when i first found myself . . . changing . . . i was sick with loathing and disgust . i thought i was so ugly i wanted to die . . .
and , now ?
now i want to live forever . i have never felt so strong or happy .
or looked so beautiful . . .
yes . i feel that , too . weakness is what is ugly .
precisely , my darling . your animal strength , your primitive power has surfaced . . . you are what you desire .
to be strong and free . . . that is all i desire .
so you shall be . . . like our brothers , the hawk and the wolf , our spirits know no master . . . we are created in the pure image of the savage god that set our turbulent universe in motion .
i did not know . . . i
what ? speakee loud ! no hear velly good .
i said , i mean no harm . . . i thought this as empty tomb .
you come stealee tleasoo ?
oh , no , never . . . nothing like that . . . never crossed my mind .
no need lie , boy . i no hurt you . do i look like i wanna hurt you ?
well , er . . . no . i mean , you do not look like dragons i have heard of .
course not . i no flum here . i come flum cathay .
cathay ?
country fa fa away . to the east , beyond the lising sun . . .
east of mercia ?
you got no idee . people there lookee diffelent speakee diffelent . nothing the same . in my countlee i bling good luck . makee lain and thunder .
you do not ravage the countryside , devouring maidens and burning the crops ?
dlagon not like that . dlagon is spilit of life . . . spilit of stlength and goodness .
then you will understand my quest . an ogre named blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn . the world outside is cursed , plunged into eternal winter . unless i return the alicorn , the earth will be frozen forever .
flozen foleva not good .
it is terrible .
ang how you do it ? how you rift cuss ?
i need your help . in order to fight blackheart , i must wear the armor of achilles . i
you come stealee tleasoo ?
oh no . . . do not you understand ?
no more listening ! your time is at an end , insignificant whelp !
honeythorn gump , is it ? i have not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragongs tears .
well , bygones are bygones , i always say .
or was it the time you and jimmy squarefoot stole the golden apples i would forged .
twas jimmy done that , i merely stood for the blame unfairly . . . but , here now , ogg , this be no time to rehash old differences , i have friends along in need of safe haven for the night .
who might these friends be ?
screwball you know , and many other of the wee folk . we serve as escort for our grand champion , jack o the green .
we be honored , friend ogg .
there s a coil of golden thread fine as spider web yet naught can break it . . . and a silver key no lock can resist .
gump , is it ?
aye , honeythorn gump , come to serenade you , jack . . . come to make you dance .
i am in no mood for dancing .
oh , but you will be , jack . . . think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a dancing ?
faerie ring ?
to be sure .
dance , jack ! the night s but begun .
and how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk ? is me music not to your liking ? mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure .
no . . . i . . . i need to rest .
you will have a long , long rest in the tomb , me lad .
i meant no disrespect .
did not you now ? well then , answer me this riddle and all be forgiven .
and if i cannot ?
why , jack , then tis your death song i will be strumming .
what !
the flower . bluebells . to hear them ringing means your life s at an end .
a riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you are thirsty for wine .
well spoke . true to the mark . and if it is wine you are wanting , it is wine we shall have .
i am honored , honeythorn gump . . . but no more tricks .
you have me word , lad . to answer a faerie riddle deserves as much .
twas the princess lili gave me the answer . . . have you seen her , by chance ?
i have laid eyes on no mortal but you this day , jack .
i fear she is lost .
mayhap you be the one that is lost , and she safe by the castle hearth . . . but , come jack , we will warm your bones .
what does she want from me ?
it looks . . . er , delicious . . . such a fine bouquet . . . very aromatic . . .
are ye afraid of me wine ? did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the wee folk ? think if ye sup with the faeries you will be enchanted ?
well . . . i . . . i do not want to be rude , but . . . it is generally known that
generally known ! what general ever knew more than to lace up his boots ?
please do not misunderstand . i am grateful for your hospitality and
he is afraid of enchantment ! will you listen to the fool prattle on .
big question that , lad . why what ?
why has this happened to the world ? why is it winter now , and dark ?
aye . honeythorn gump would be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer .
do not you know ?
if you are looking for enchantment , jack , that i can give thee . . .
then , that is gone wrong ? why did it happen ?
if ye want more tricks , i am your man , but for big questions ye must go elsewhere .
do not you care about that is happened ?
course we care . what good s the world locked in a season of death . frozen up , no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer s night no babies to tickle no more spells to cast . . . think that is an enjoyable prospect ?
there must be an answer somewhere .
true . . . but it will not come easy or free . if ye want to ask , ask jenny greenteeth .
jenny greenteeth ? who s she ?
how is it this hag knows the truth ?
think there be truth only in beauty , lad ? if you have the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws , jenny greenteeth has the answers you seek .
will you lead me to her ?
aye . on the morrow we go , but tonight . . . . . . tonight is for making merry .
aye . that foul wallow be where jenny greenteeth dwells . oona . . . lure her out . play the part of a girl child .
what do i do ?
do not get caught , that is what ! she will suck your bones like honey comb .
and if she thinks me a liar ?
fie on what she thinks ! you mind her claws and teeth . . . cast your spell , oona .
lamentable news , jack . . . but tis the fate of the living concerns us now .
did you hear ? twas the killing of the unicorn caused it .
aye . black barongs mischief .
if the horn be restored the curse is ended .
time for a champion . can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird s nests , jack ?
i will do what i have to do , for princess lili s sake !
bravely spoke . you have the heart of a champion , true enough .
twill take more than heart . where do we find the armor of achilles , for a start ?
i know where to find it . taking possession be another matter .
have we turned grave robber , then ?
a tomb it once was , boy , and a tomb it may yet be . . . there s another in residence at lindfarne now .
and who might that be ?
no less a creature than the lindfarne worm .
now , jack lad , no one s asking ye to skewer the worm . even st . michael would have a job on his hands for all that . but the serpent hoards a pile of booty , achilles armor among his treasures . . . if we find our way within the mound and him asleep . . .
knaves and robbers . . .
you do the praying . i have work ahead .
there s the spirit , lad . if ye run into trouble , give a yank here and we will haul ye up .
that is left of me . . . how do i recognize the armor of achilles ?
you will know it when you see it . . . tis a splendid sight , all covered with gold . . . do not fear making noise . dragons be deaf as tree stumps .
better we eat him than the other way round .
no false modesty , lad . you are a proper champion . achilles armor sits on you like it was forged to fit .
well then , you have got the sword and you have got the armor all s lacking is the steed .
screwball ! you dolt ! i have a mind to change you into a toad .
something s coming .
it would appear so .
careful , lad .
the colt s still too small .
i am small . . . and i can make myself smaller still . . . small as a bee ! small as dust . . . ! want to see me do it ?
we have no time for tricks this day , honeythorn gump .
tricks , is it ? why i will trick ye ! ungrateful whelp ! i will sour your milk and bird droppings will fall from the sky wherever ye walk .
save your mischief for the black baron .
aye ! that too .
you will need more than bird droppings for blackheart .
i will drop a cow on the knave !
drop a mountain on him and we will not need our troops .
we march on castle couer de noir within the hour .
how do you plan on finding this here castle , if ye do not mind me asking ?
a true and troubling question , gump . . . we will start from where the unicorn was killed . the baron must have left a trail .
track the demon to his lair .
aye . and hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying .
whatever for ?
jenny greenteeth said follow the raven in her flight . . .
aye . said to follow it to the edge of night . but is this the right bird ?
i am sure . it spoke to me .
birds speak to me all the time . what did it say ?
beware .
sounds like the bird we want . all right lads , follow yon raven !
send oona up above the tree tops . she be our eyes .
good plan that .
blackheart ?
aye . he is enchanted the lot of them . his reward for delivering the unicorn .
foul fellow , this couer de noir .
the foulest . mayhap i can cut them free .
jack , do not !
what know you of fields of war ?
ofttimes , the wee folk come out to tend the wounded . . . staunch bleeding with cobwebs . . . give a parched mouth a sip of dew . . . cool a fevered brow . . .
well . . . if the knight be already dead what harm is there in . . . borrowing a thing or two ?
stealing his arms ?
that would be devil s needle . last landmark i know in these woods .
beyond devil s needle , all is unknown .
nay , jack , tis not what you are thinking .
i trust our own welcome will be more hospitable .
jack , jack , it is dwarves live here . hard working chaps . hammering in the forge all the live long day . make the most wondrous things , they do .
nay . that is but to distract the casual visitor . a dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly .
better to kill than be disturbed .
your imagination runs away with you , jack . . . those bones be but battlefield gleanings , like i mentioned . a wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited .
here is a bold championgs reward to serve as a dwarf s doorstop .
pure gold it is . . . plays a different note every time .
something the matter ?
ogg s footprints !
dwarves be very sensitive about their feet .
certainly understandable .
very secretive , they are . keep their feet covered up . best if you do not mention it .
gump , you are putting words in my mouth .
stoutly spoke , lad . these dwarves be sore grouches . . . pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling .
we are not in a tournament , gump . ah , but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons . . .
tis not the sword that counts , but the man what swings it . rest easy , jack .
god protect you , honeythorn gump .
your strong right arm s all the protection i will need this night .
be gentle with them , jack . they only march to please you . were this a faerie journey , we would ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems .
we will surely be in our graves if we do not .
going grows slower . . . we have not made . . . half a mile in two hours . . .
there s the way , mates .
it bodes evil .
willful creature , that one . . .
stay on your guard , jack . the bug is enchanted surely .
no , thank the lord , but she be sore envenomed by the spider s bite .
we are blind now . oona was our eyes and ears . how do we find the castle couer de noir without her ?
we will find it .
easily said . . . the raven passed this way hours ago .
heading true north . we continue in that direction .
never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course .
we will trust in faith , gump .
aye , lad . . . we have little else to go by .
long as we do not lose heart , jack . . .
we will never find the barongs castle .
once you thought we would never find the greek s armor and look at ye now , decked out like a proper hero .
nay . this time we strike first !
nay . i show no pity to imps and fiends .
i know the rogue , jack . tis jimmy squarefoot .
but seem to have gotten lost on the way .
no . . . but what choice have we ?
the chill is worse this night .
it is your own fear troubles you . . . we are here , are not we ? for all the dark magic protecting it .
it feels wrong , jack . . . like a trap .
there s more than one way to spring a trap .
aye , so long as you are not too greedy for the bait .
on the morrow i will be awake enough to see if dreams come true .
pray they do not turn out to be nightmares .
we will need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders .
why not mine the damned walls ?
we do both . our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under . . .
defend ourselves . we have bested far worse already .
easily spoken . . .
do not loose heart . . . assemble the archers . have everyone not holding a shield man a bow . shoot the damned things as they fly .
there are not enough arrows .
never mind . just do it ! retrieve the arrows somehow .
and frog do not fly and bite like tomcats . it be magic , jack . . . powerful ogre s magic .
there is not much time !
been telling you that all along , lad .
what magic have we on our side ?
faerie magic s no match for a sorcerer s power . . . we have ogg s gifts , the key and the
that is it ! the unbreakable line ! we will tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis . . . then , i will climb up and chop down the drawbridge .
will you chance a miss ?
there must be some way to get it up there .
that is it !
aye . before the wee pesties attacked .
then it is godspeed , screwball .
fire away !
best get down close to the moat , lad .
aye . we are good as inside .
it is what we will find there worries me .
it does not matter .
nonsense ! course it matters .
. . . the princess lili . . . i have killed her .
the wound is mortal .
nay . you have not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine .
can you save her ?
easily . . . the question is , can we save ourselves ? be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war .
i do not . . . understand .
the alicorn , lad . come to your senses ! unless we find baron couer de noir and bring back the horn the world is doomed .
in the dark , lad ? why should he do that ?
because sunlight will kill him . quickly now , give me the key .
sunlight , you say ?
aye . hurry now , gump , the key !
mean you to seek him out below ?
i am not afraid of the dark .
i admire your valor , jack . by all means , seek him out . . . but first , we needs visit the kitchen .
did you bring me here to sup ?
nay , lad , we are here to collect a weapon you will need fighting the baron .
what weapon ?
sunlight .
plan on carrying some away in a kettle ?
easier than that , jack . screwball ! fetch me down a couple of them plates .
patience , lad .
ah , but you will . and so will the baron , when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway .
tis a delicate operation , lad . requires a bit of engineering . . . next !
do not get too far !
hurry up !
never show mercy !
i could have struck off his head just now !
sapphire !
he will not escape me .
you are on your own . . . like a true champion .
i have not heard a note out of you .
not in the mood , i am afraid .
listen to him . not in the mood . . .
on a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen . . . a day so fair as forty springtimes
i am not denying it is a joyous day
where is your joy if you cannot sing ?
were the princess lili to join me i would sing till my lungs burst !
she lives . . . is not that worth singing about ?
she lives like all the world before the barongs curse lifted . now the world s reborn , yet still she sleeps . . .
tis not the wound , that is sure . not a scar remains . . . we are talking about a spell harder to repair than sword work .
i will do anything . . . face any challenge !
might not need a gesture quite so grand . what were you doing the very moment the barongs curse fell on the world ?
i was with the princess .
where ?
by the pond . she was teasing me .
go on . . . go on . . .
she tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it . said she would marry me if i did .
and did you ?
nay . it was lost . when i came up for air the pond was frozen over .
that is it then . . . the ring !
i will try .
you are good at riddles . . . find the ring and the spell is broken .
hush up , screwball . do your own worm sticking if you like the taste so well .
nay . jack s the dragon slayer , ai not you , jack .
wolf slayer , worm sticker . . . give a cheer for the champion !
no , no , no . . . this is different !
these chaps will need a woodpecker to pick their teeth .
screwball ! be quiet . . . ! we have friends live neath the needle . they will no doubt provide safe refuge for the night .
gonna make ogre stew !
three cheers for our champion .
very thrifty . even got your arrow back .
they have fired the moat !
you will do it because i am you liege and i command you to do it !
rise , screwball , and into the basket with you .
nay , sire , i will cling to it as to life itself . . .
good , lad . . . here , jack , give me a hand with the windlass . . . there s a good fellow . . .
they will do nicely .
sorry .
oh , jack , you are a wild man to use me so .
if you like .
never .
but you did . . . you did !
i may have said perhaps . . .
liar !
or perchance . . .
sport , indeed .
the baron is a frightful man . they say he is an ogre . he wears a mask so none may see his face .
blackheart . aptly named .
oh , fie . what about the unicorn ?
unicorn ?
a promise is a sacred oath .
all right . i will show you something sacred .
stop complaining .
a gentleman would offer water .
only were he a fool to boot . see yon viper ?
i detest serpents .
that viper has envenomed the water . no animal will drink here now .
what shall we do ?
be patient .
that is the matter ?
i have lost my napkin . it was all elf work and lace . . . i must have dropped it when you startled me so .
i will go search for it .
do not leave me now . i fear the unicorn will not show himself without you .
i am not its master .
the napkin will keep . i would rather not be alone .
your command is my wish , princess lili .
shhh !
i am a princess . you have no right to order me about .
in these woods you are a commoner . now be quiet . true royalty approaches .
they rival the angels of paradise .
oh jack , might not i touch one ? it would thrill me so .
are you honest ?
jack !
tis a fair question . if you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap .
he will not flee if i show myself ?
not if you be chaste . tis an awesome test of virginity .
i have no fear of failure . your implications are most unbecoming .
i am not your judge . . . nor have i any desire to witness the trial .
to fetch your napkin .
i do not know . they have hurt the unicorn .
who ?
my father and the baron .
damned hunters . it was a trap , and you were the bait !
i did not know . . . i did not . . . it was so lovely . . . he was in my lap like . . . like a baby . . . and . . . i . . .
they tricked you .
my own father . . .
how bad was the unicorngs wound ?
it happened so fast . he was hurt and ran away .
he did run ?
oh , yes , and the mare with him .
good . they will never catch him . there s not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn .
i do not want it on me .
its powers are strong .
i do not want to be reminded of what happened .
do you think memory can be washed away like a few spots of blood ?
jack . . . green jack , you must not flatter me so .
tis the truth .
a maid must beware of flattery . . . methinks you want to kiss me .
there s no happier thought under heaven .
if i were your bride , would the kissing ever stop . . . ? do you wish to marry me , jack ?
my lady mocks me .
nay , jack , i am but wary of your intentions .
my heart intends no more than that you love me as i do you .
oh , la . . .
let it . have not you a cozy bower we might hide in ?
tis not fit for a princess .
be it fit for your wife , green jack ?
i have no wife .
then , perchance you will me .
if wishes were horses even beggars would ride .
do you wish it , jack ? wish you this our wedding band ?
what if i answer yes ? will my wish come true ?
jack . . . forgive me . . .
only that is right . . .
i was bewitched . . . it is better this way . . .
they told me you were dead .
you have freed me , jack . . .
it is the barongs damnable work ! too cowardly to stand and fight . . . he used you to save himself .
no . . . it is not you he is afraid of , it is . . . light . . .
what ?
sunlight . . . it destroys him .
sunlight ?
that is why he goes masked during the day . . .
so , he is hiding in the dark . . .
in the dark . . . where i join him . . .
no ! do not let go . . . you must not ! i love you !
and i . . . love you . . .
whilst you were sleeping , i fetched your ring .
i cannot have been under much more than a minute .
seemed like weeks and weeks . such a terrible dream . . . i could never tell you . . .
is what you said about the ring but another dream ?
oh no , dearest jack . . . i meant every word .
you are teasing still .
but . . . i am a green man . i have no title , nor lands . . . scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body .
you wear your weeds as well as golden armor , jack . like a true prince . . . a champion !
lili . . . i love you !
and i love you , my husband .
ouch ! something s biting me .
biting you ?
pinching me !
pinching ? where ?
everywhere ! ow !
i cannot see a thing .
nor can i . damn ! it is buzzing all around me . ouch ! i can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear . . . says its name is oona !
oona ? do you suppose it is a faerie ?
ow ! whatever it is , it hurts .
grand champion , is it ? and what great cause leads you to me ?
we seek the ogre , baron couer de noir . he slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter .
thought the weather terrible of late .
his feet shall never cross my lips .
another hero s hand me down . . . thurgis , note the armor tis greek work .
i bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness . . . for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty .
well spoke , boy . you have discerning taste for one so young . . . just who might you be ?
they call me green jack , ma am .
come closer then , jack , that i might give you proper thanks .
your fair smile be thanks enough . better i stand afar to admire your beauty complete .
the moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you . . .
the moon is too round of face , methinks .
the sight of you makes flowers seem like dross . all the heavenly angels must envy your grace .
i like well your conceit , jack . tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world .
aye . and it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here . i entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow , most lovely of the lovely .
dear lad , what does winter bespeak but death ? it is a time of mourning . this calamity is a curse . something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world .
a unicorngs been slain . the last stallion in all the country .
why then , there thou hast . we be lucky worse has not befallen us .
couer de noir ! a demon if the devil ever made one .
he chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot .
that would be the barongs way . there will be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished .
how do i get the horn back ?
you will need the fastest steed alive , for couer de noir s castle rests at the very edge of the earth . only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of achilles will protect you from his fury .
where do i find the barongs castle ?
follow the raven in her flight , follow old black wing to the edge of night . . .
not very precise directions .
come sit beside me , sweet boy , and i will draw you a map .
nay . tempting as your invitation be . tell me one thing more .
ask away , sweet man .
what became of the princess ?
princess ? i know of no princess .
princess lili , godwings daughter . she was with me when calamity struck , but after i could find no trace of her .
is she fair , this princess ?
exceeding fair .
as fair as me ?
twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky .
she is dead !
no !
dead , dead , dead .
i do not believe you .
far as you are concerned she is dead , believe it or not .
do not be sad , jack , not with me here to give you cheer .
tis not the time to speak of cheer .
you will visit again ?
as a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom .
what a fine meal you would make , be the rest of you sweet as your tongue .
i pray god grants it me .
sorry .
then i would kiss you without turning my garments inside out and sewing bells all over .
no need for bells , jack . i will nay enchant ye .
no fear of that now .
then , tis not for chastity ? methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night .
i live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand year old oak . my bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins . there s no need of weaponry to keep the maids away .
i am partial to oaks , as are all faerie folk . may not i come visit sometime ?
i would be honored .
only that ?
and charmed , of course .
fie ! do not speak of charms . i should charm you for being so dull witted .
i had no thought of offending you , oona .
do i not please you , jack ?
in every way .
and am i not fair ?
wondrously so .
then why do you speak sweeter words to jenny greenteeth ?
that was in jest .
jest with me then .
how so ?
tell me i am fair , as you did the hag .
you are fair as the first new flower of spring . . .
and sweet ?
sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind .
pray you be sweet as your words , dear jack .
a faerie s love makes anything possible .
i am promised to another !
what shape i take matters not . long you for another ? i will give you your heart s desire .
you . . . you . . . you mortal you !
please . . .
why should i feel such pain ? should be the other way round . . . i could vex you . . . make you dance your life away . . .
threats will not make me love you . tis not the way of the human heart .
and as barren of love as stone .
i would build a wall around me with such stone , so the likes of you might never enter .
be fair , oona .
you beware , jack ! you and your porridge pot heart !
heading north still ?
true north . . . straight up that pass , through the net .
i know where to find him . . . he lies out on the marsh , raven fodder his horn torn from his head .
we wait .
i think she is about to foal .
watch behind or i will never collect on it !
small miracles better than no miracles . . .
of course they are alive . all nature is living .
up ahead !
come on , gump , let s have a look at this witchcraft .
his honor , i suppose . . . seeing he no longer can defend it .
bah ! you faeries have the morals of ferrets .
have not heard a bird sing in days . . .
or a kite . . . ! we could make a kite . . . let the wind do the work
done like a champion . can you reach me with the line ?
it is done . . . we will never catch him .
no speeches ! that is a little swim after sticking worms and ogres ?
oh , but i have .
i slew the lindfarne worm with it .
sigurd the volsung slew fafnir with that blade . . . see the line where regin welded the break ?
achilles wore it before the gates of troy .
you are well equipped , i would say . legendary arms . . .
may god protect you .
i am sending you back to hell !
yes , yes . . . jimmy squarefoot good friend to one and all . . .
the black baron , you say ?
much good we do the world , for all our noble quest . . .
jimmy squarefoot no lost .
castle couer de noir built with magic . . . simple as death . . . strong as hate . . .
you do know where it is ?
to castle couer de noir ?
there will be spoils aplenty if you guide us there . once we breach the walls , help yourself to all you can carry .
that very nice .
you follow .
a castle s but stone and mortar
nay . castle couer de noir is devil s work . . . built with sorrow and grief . . .
you have been inside ?
in a dream .
do not speak to me of dreams ! i feel i have been dreaming since the unicorn was killed .
what are you doing ?
i am not cheating ! i am not looking !
he was there and then he was not !
we did a lot of the wiring too .
with dale . oh , and i got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through !
i thought i might stop by .
i wanna be with you today .
oh , honey . there s not much to do there . i mean , it is all work .
we can work .
sam !
since seventh grade .
home after . will you come in and say hi ?
i guess it depends on what you give up on .
he is here . check the bathroom .
i checked everywhere . he is not there .
it is so beautiful .
mom said i should .
oh .
i would have anyway .
i do not think dad wants you home .
who are you ?
what color ?
red .
i love red ! that is my favorite color !
here , honey !
that is wrong ?
and why was the alarm on ?
oh . . . i set it to see if it would work .
you would better call and cancel .
oh god , we do not want the police !
i could not sleep last night .
i am supposed to be mad at you , but i am not .
uh . . . using josh like that .
has he eaten anything at all ?
i would be more comfortable if you had not slept with josh . and george would be more comfortable if he were not dying .
who are all these people ?
i will survive .
he seems lonely .
are you his friend ?
no .
why ?
marilyn manson . . . and i guess he is into guys . i hate nose rings . and the blue eye shadow thing really is not working .
why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage ?
i am living here while i build another house .
is that legal ?
nope .
monday .
that is that ?
i am not shaving my legs or pits this summer , i have decided .
he is not gay . i found out purely by accident , believe me .
i mean drugs . i thought you said he was ?
he would not use around me . i do not like any of it .
you are a good girl .
i need to ask you something , mr . nelson .
i want you to try something with me , okay ?
i have taken a lot of morphine . oral morphine . . . for my back . can i wait till i can say no and sound convincing ?
maybe your tongue . . . i do not know , my mouth is numb . why did you do that ?
let s shut up and not kill her .
what did you think it would be ?
i do not know . . . more like when i kissed sam .
hi .
what are you doing here ?
where to ?
i am supposed to be in tahoe .
your dad s really gonna build his house ?
i do not know .
well , if you do not go , i guess i will see you .
i do not know .
where is your dad ?
he jumped into the ocean .
tell him i said hi .
you look better without make up .
i cannot even take a shower here .
come over to my house whenever you want . i will tell my mom .
i might not stay , anyway .
i will get your back .
no . that is okay .
yeah .
your dad dated my mom after her divorce .
really ?
i wanted him to marry her .
why ?
turn over .
no thanks .
i can use your mom s .
i am okay .
his parents took his car . they are making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer .
he asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars .
he can peddle over anytime he wants to for it .
i am sorry . i am just here to shower .
hand me a towel . i am getting out .
i am coming in .
i do not want you to !
we are not gonna do anything .
why are you so stupid ?
why are you so uptight ?
i do not even . . . what do you mean ? i do not even know what that means .
it means i am gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way .
hand me a towel . hand me a towel .
does everything have to have a point ?
it is freakish . i do not get it . i am not really supposed to touch you , but i can look .
what are you talking about ?
josh said . . .
i am not gay .
you are driving me crazy ! do you know what it is like trying to jack off in an armoire ?
not really .
you are off , you know ? you are way , way off .
i thought i was helping you .
it would help me if i could kiss you .
no , i do not . . . no . i thought we were just friends .
what you think , you know , does not have much to do with reality . i mean , i hope i am not the first to say that about you .
okay , but then we will just be friends . okay ?
okay . i guess .
are you afraid of heights ?
what ?
if he tricked me into loving him , is what i meant .
you would hate him for the trick .
not if what he left me was real .
he asked where you were ! he wants you with him .
i do not wanna go .
floating to catalina .
what ?
he is got a standing invitation .
just , i mean , well , you are here every single day .
he is at work while i am here .
i guess i would just be jealous if i were him .
well , he does not need to worry .
if my kids and my wife were always at an ex husband s house , i would worry .
he is not the type to worry .
will he talk to me ?
no .
from tuesday to yesterday , not including monday or today . okay . . . mrs . dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn . the corliss have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your . . . structure .
ipo s caused the rat population on this street .
it could have been a squirt gun .
you have been good this week .
we have known each other since grade school .
i mean , but did you both go camping on weekends ? listen to music ? masturbate together ? talk on the phone ?
george just never really . . . aimed that high . even with not hitting a rabbit . i knew you were doing that , by the way . that is why i stopped doing it with you . you were no fun . it was always like you were frightened . quiet and boring .
he builds models for architects . his dad , on the other hand , was the real deal . designed and built the coolest houses i have ever seen .
he wants the entire roof taken off and lowered .
i have been dreading you .
a violation ?
oh , yes .
and if i enclosed it ?
an exhaust system or a window is code .
a sink ?
allowed outside the enclosed area .
i flushed it down the toilet .
if that is what it takes .
it is thirty feet .
well , if it is , we have a problem .
after your last extension request and with design review and the board of adjustment and the appeals to the city council , was there an amended permit ?
to the patio and one north facing window . . . and six inches to the height .
months .
what are you on ?
pardon me ?
how much weight have you lost ?
oh . . . nothing . thirty pounds . i just have not been very hungry .
how is your wife ?
when we divorce a decade ago , she was very , very angry . now she is just hostile .
he buys and sells the world .
peter webber ! right . quite the spotlight on that guy .
i did tell you , did not i ? that i would be ready to start the berlin model today ?
well , that is sort of . . . you are sure you are not hungry ?
typing and clicking myself to renderings is not why i started building models .
all of us are typing and clicking , george . whether we want to , or not .
i am not .
which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects . it does not make a lot of sense anymore to want what we do not have and do not want what we do .
maybe that is too long .
maybe . . . ?
that is too long .
how old are you ?
forty .
we were probably in school together . you went to berkley ?
i was a sophomore when i got the call my parents were dead .
i hate this job .
what are you talking about ? you love your job .
from the day i started . . . to today . cannot stand it .
it may sound that way , but i react out of fear . my life has nothing to do with what i like or do not like . you have not been listening , have you ?
i did not know there would be a quiz , george .
for everything .
well , i feel better about this now .
good . i was hoping for that .
what can i do for you , george ?
i built my first model here when i was twenty . there are hundreds of them on shelves around the office . twenty years of my life . i was wondering if i might be able to pick a few to keep , to take home ? only the ones that really mean something to me .
thank you .
well , it is the least i can do .
yes , it is .
she is out with a friend .
oh . . . do you know when she will be home ?
she did not really say .
oh . . . okay .
uh huh .
i did not recognize you !
i am sorry .
alyssa said you do not even have plumbing over there .
not a shower .
i want you both to stay .
thanks , i would like that . thank you .
thank you .
you are here early today .
we are getting out of the ground today .
it is midnight . that is the matter , sam ?
nothing . my dad s dying . i really need to talk to alyssa .
he escaped . he is going back in .
does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your . . . penis in plain view of my sixteen year old daughter ?
there are no windows facing my . . . exposure .
george , this is the third time .
the plumber s due out on friday .
you will have to explain that to the police .
you were the only neighbor i could tolerate .
i did warn you .
my life is a warning . i just cannot figure out for what .
and you thought they might be under her dress ?
where are you ? you are driving me crazy , waiting like this . i want you in me now !
i do not know .
it will just be my brother the dweeb on weekends . all we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin , dude . my dad s gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod . income village is the place to hook up with hump .
i will ask .
hey , it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer .
i know what the deal is . josh is a pimp . i am not stupid .
you do not know what the deal is . there is no fucking deal .
to check up on me ?
i will be around to check up on you .
why would you be there ?
because i live there .
you live in cory s parents cabin ?
no i am not !
you will know me by the time we are through .
i am not going !
i will get your bag .
you have everything ?
you do not have a choice .
mom . . . please .
if you hit me , i will call the police .
you have worn out your welcome at this house , sam . i will not ever hit you . this may well be the worst three months of your life , but you have earned it . so , pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck . now .
i will hate you forever .
you cannot even begins to know how much i hate my father . think of it as a family tradition .
i almost saw catalina .
goodnight .
i warned you yesterday .
do not touch me ! you cannot touch me !
no .
get the inkling , sam . i am getting tired of your attitude .
no you do not .
why ?
it bugs me .
you snore at night . that bugs me . can i take you out ?
your brothers are right . it was the most god awful smell i have ever had my nose around .
i am gonna take a walk . i need some money .
you will have money when you work .
you are so predictable .
i would blame you . i want you here .
i am not doing it !
it will be fine .
why do not you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom ?
i would rather sell my nuts to a castrati .
and i do not take a shower in the middle of the yard .
i can promise you complete privacy .
you cannot promise me anything ! you do not have anything to promise ! you live in a garage ! you do not have cable ! you are not hooked up to the internet because you do not even own a computer ! you do not have a job !
you will have money when you work for it .
hey . . . hey !
i do not know .
when are you going to be back ?
i do not know .
well , until you know , you cannot go .
oh , okay .
a friend of yours is here .
did you got through my pants ?
i might have a solution .
i will apologize for everything but today . . . today i give a shit .
you are too fucking late .
the gloves on the table are for you .
you cannot make me do a thing .
sit down for a second .
no .
my dad used to play a game . i never really understood what it was until after he was gone .
the game was to make me smaller than he was . no matter what . he could be almost invisible as a human being , but i had to be smaller . so if i got good grades , i was a pussy for not playing football . if i cut my hair for him , it was not short enough . if i shaved it , i looked like a psycho . i never won the game . not once . and if he could not make me smaller with words . . .
i will not ever hit you . i do not want you smaller . i want you to be happy . you are not . not here with me . not home with your mother . not up in tahoe . not alone . not anywhere . you are what i was most of my life , sam . i see it in your eyes . in your sleep . in your answer to everything . you are barely alive .
i am not even listening .
you know that great thing , though ? is that change can be so constant you do not even feel the difference until there is one . it can be so slow that you do not even notice that your life is better or worse , until it is . or it can just blow you away . make you something different in an instant . it happened to me .
do not . i do not want it .
we have not build shit . you are just tearing down your father .
try it . it feels good .
hi , mom .
i know . why ?
i like how it feels not to feel .
how do you become something you are not ?
what would you like to be ?
what i am not .
what are you now ?
nothing .
that is not true .
see , that is the thing . . . i am what i say i am .
i know parts of who you are .
what do you know about me ?
he is got nothing to do with me .
i could not imagine how i could compete with him for any part of you . so , i did not . he wanted you to have his last name . . . i let him even take that .
he was a prick when i was six , and he is a prick today .
i am telling you now .
i gave up on you .
i would be in tahoe having fun if you had given up .
what would you be doing now ?
getting high , i guess .
if i asked you to stop , would you ?
i have not used anything for two days . i am trying .
i am proud of you , sam .
do not be . and hide whatever that new drug is you have . i like it .
i was just thinking about my mom . she would not leave him . i remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses . i mean it was dark outside and in . but we never talked about it .
sun glasses ?
to hide a black eye .
why would not she leave ?
i think she was terrified of living with him . . . but maybe even more terrified of life without him .
i would have killed him .
everything would have been better if you had . you would have liked your grandmother . and there would be a girl out there that would have her mother . i remember reading about her in the paper . they could not find her father and her mother was dead . i still feel guilty about that .
do you ever wish you had done it ?
after everything he did to you and your mom ?
after everything .
that is so weird . . .
absolutely . have him put it on a separate line . at christmas , we will pact it so full of lights , we will make god wear sunglasses .
i do not think mom cares that much that my . . . that peter left .
she seemed upset .
that is wrong with your back ?
are you taking them still ?
no , but i count them . in a sock is not new , you know ?
the kind where there is not really an answer .
i still do not know what that means .
i wanted you here so we could have a few months together . maybe everything happens for a reason . something bad to force something good .
the kind where there is not really an answer .
i still do not know what that means .
i wanted you here so we could have a few months together . maybe everything happens for a reason . something bad to force something good .
yes .
you lied to me !
i would have lied to me if i thought i would believe it .
this was all for your sake , was not it ? having me here ? trying to get me to like you .
i never tried to get you to like me . i tried to get you to love me .
well , congratulations ! you fucking pulled it off !
here .
good for you .
i would build a house .
you know what mortise and tenon is ?
stage four pancreatic cancer . they have not even pretended to offer treatment . you tell me , when would you start eating red meat ?
can you build a house in four months ?
i can die trying .
i have not been touched in years .
a handshake , or you know , someone pats you on your back through clothes . doctors , people who have to touch you . but not by people who want to .
no . a friend . . . your mother ? everybody gets touched by someone they love .
is not that weird ? i mean , i dated a little bit after my divorce , for four or five years . six years . i know when my son was younger . . . maybe when he was ten or eleven even , he would run up and wrap his arms around me .
we just were not very much alike , i guess . i do not know . i liked your dad more than i liked you .
left you this place .
it was in my name so he would not lose it . he stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title .
do you know what i would give to have this ! forget how i got it ! i cannot afford dirt in this town . i live in riverside , goddammitt and you get to piss in the ocean .
thanks for telling me .
at least your father tried , george .
i know there s an explanation .
check the permits . it was built as a guesthouse . it is a legally rentable unit grandfathered when south laguna was incorporated .
i have not forced him to work . i only wet him down once . why would he leave ?
i need you to do me a favor .
god , you look like crap , george .
i want you to find someone for me .
i do not let him . he just loves to .
three .
oh . sorry .
it is okay .
she needs to be alone , i think .
because dad left ?
she is a little sad , is all .
i do not even care if he ever comes back .
ring the bell before you try the door .
you let him pierce his nose ?
where is he ?
where he always is .
he does not answer .
why does he have a lock on his door ?
because he put the lock on ! do you think i told him he could have a nose ring ? ! why do you ask me everything you should ask him ! ? i do not know anything , anymore !
thanks for waking me up . picking me up . you are loud today .
you are inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion !
you are the most beautiful woman i have ever known in my life .
i am not talking just physically . even your anger is perfect .
you did not think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat ? !
a blueprint spool .
where have you been for a week ? !
four days . i left to think .
what did you do with your dog ?
kurt s been feeding him .
but you cannot call me while you think ?
i was not thinking . look , i am sorry i did not think to call you while i thought . . . i think .
why would they tow your truck ?
i was parked in day parking .
why call me ?
i am going to tear down the shack and build my house .
you have been saying that for twenty years . while we were dating , you said it .
there s nothing anymore to stop me .
money ?
severance pay . and i am going to cash in my life insurance policy .
how many years did i live with your beams and boards ? first in the garage , then in the living room . we are going to do it , robin . next year . next year . salvaged floorboards from a house in pasadena . doors from a church in new hampshire . . .
i love those doors .
where will you live ?
the garage .
look , i was not serious about you taking sam , so you do not have to get into any actual construction to get out of it .
whengs school over ?
friday . . . god , i hate the thought of him home all day .
i will be by saturday to pick him up .
he does not want to spend the weekends with you anymore .
not for the weekend . for the summer .
the garage is plumbed . i will put in a toilet . we will survive .
thank you for at least sounding sincere .
sounding ? i need help . he is cheap labor .
one of you would end up dead .
at least we will have a house to show for it .
forget it , really . i will survive .
i want him with me .
no , you do not . trust me .
i am married .
i do not have a phone .
i drove over and you were gone .
i cannot leave the house ?
last time you were gone for a week !
did you tell him he was spending the summer with me ?
no . i was going to let you do that .
he is not spending the summer in tahoe .
let s go .
he is not spending the entire summer with another kid in tahoe . if he leaves , i will follow him up there and i will drag him home by his nose ring . he can hate me . you can hate me . he can try to kill me while i sleep . you can call the police . you can call your husband or your attorney , but sam is spending the summer with me . he is my son . he is sixteen . that is it .
well , for later then .
what ?
i used to live here .
but you hated four out of the five you did .
i was here six years . and i only hated two .
which ?
the first and the last .
sam s favorite .
what have you been before today ?
it was just that , maybe the way the sun struck the ocean , the sound of the waves . it was simple , whatever it was . then i started thinking about the last time i felt this good . it is been a long time .
do you remember ?
the only time i can think of for sure , i was holding onto sam in the ocean , saving him from the waves .
we have it on video ! was that when ? my parents were down for his sixth birthday ! i remember that .
i am fine . nothing . i will drop by your lunch tomorrow .
i dreamed about your house last night .
finished or unfinished ?
it was perfect , george . amazing . it was so real .
did not you once dream you could lick people well , though ?
that was not a dream . that was sam .
oh . . . with his ear infection !
my tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him .
the antibiotics were not working . it is what i believe , george .
hindsight . it is like foresight without a future .
you are not well .
my stupid back .
no , i am . . . thanks . i took something .
he will not use my shower . i do not get it .
i kind of said that maybe they could do something . help . i am sorry . they really wanted to come . i really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me . i do not think they will be too much trouble .
i will find something that will not kill them .
or wound . let them keep their eyes and fingers .
you are a good mother .
i think so .
this was my very first slow dance .
i smiled at him .
watch out for the smile , boys .
oh , i am worse . much , much worse .
no . why ? i like to be with sam .
it is just that there s less that adam and ryan can do anymore . i would hate to have them bored .
how much time do they get to spend with their dad ?
what is it with this ? they would not spend less time with peter if they lived here ! he has no time !
i would rather you not be here .
i can hire workers to help me .
going on ?
when i picked you up from the train station . . . what you said .
what did i say ?
that thing about i was the most , you know , beautiful person you had ever known . what was that ?
that was the truth .
you have never said that before .
i will say a lot of things i have never said before . it is habit .
it sounded like a pick up line .
i cannot pick you up .
you bit my finger .
if i were not married ?
i need to know .
you need to know what ? do i still love you ?
i did not think you would come today .
i kept thinking about it , what you said . . . i hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me .
no . mostly me .
peter left me yesterday .
left you ?
no goodbye . no fuck you . no are you in love with george ?
what did he say ?
i will be in the bedroom .
what ?
so could i .
it is not my back that is killing me .
i am an idiot to have you up there .
not a perfect day .
no .
does alyssa know ?
nothing .
you got any weed ?
you got the money ?
do not even . . . i am there .
i was not sure .
she would not even fucking go out with until she was sixteen . i mean , that is not even a rule , just her own thing . she like figures things out on her own and then that is it .
i am thinking it is too weird now .
i could use the money .
who ?
i am sixteen years old . i am underage . how could i possibly threaten you ?
everything happens for a reason . that is what my dad said .
then you tell me , what just happened ?
the payoff .
his father is a man .
a man he respects .
is lois still here ? i am starved .
i will make you something .
should i ?
it would worry me .
what would you be if you asked adam and ryan to run in now and hug you ?
i would be you .
we should take a vacation .
do you remember anything i have said that was not negative ?
sooner than the fall .
lois will stay with them . or we can pawn them off on your parents .
what ?
i have been helping for the last few days . weeks . sam s working . i told you sam was working . i mean , he really is .
good . that was the plan . we could not stand him and george needed help .
you cannot go because of sam ?
we have not been away together for three years . what difference does a few months make ?
you cannot go with me because of sam ?
sam is working at something for the first time in his life . once in a while he even talks to me . i want to be around for that .
so am i , robin . i am working at something , too . i am even talking . do you want to be around for it ?
i know .
what are you doing home ?
i always felt i could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me .
you live a fabulous life , robin .
despite you .
i never asked for more .
that is the problem .
please do not leave me .
sam took them to a movie .
i will be in the bedroom .
that was my plan . . . to be hardly recognizable to you as me .
i feel in love with george again .
are you wearing eye shadow ?
take it off .
if i walk out the door , who s gonna be here tonight for the follow through ?
either do you .
do you like red ?
hey .
you got a dog ?
it is not ours . it is george s .
why ?
no .
i guess i could teach you some things .
okay .
i did not go in your room .
i locked the door ! get out ! i locked the door ! get out !
can you stay for dinner ?
depends on what i would give up on .
i do not know what i am doing .
i would not let adam or ryan see you doing it .
yeah .
you could keep it and rent it out ?
this is what he wants .
i read the letter . you read the will . he wants you to keep it . to live in it some day .
then maybe this is not what he wants , but this what he was hoping for . maybe it is what i want .
why ?
he will be gone for his birthday .
what did you say ?
dad said it first .
i just thought it would be nice .
not all day . i will be home after lunch .
can we really help build a house ?
someone stop her !
yes , it is .
would you stop being ridiculous ? your father wants sam home as much as i do .
enough for drinks , popcorn and candy !
dad s home , already ?
in the bedroom .
nagger ?
no , nigger .
nigger .
that is my girl .
better make it a week .
is mae rose okay ?
she is doing just fine .
and the baby ?
he is a big one .
it is a boy ! well , let s get a look at him .
thought you would never ask . biscuit needs some gravy .
i am talking about a haircut .
cost you a pair of nylons .
hell with him . it ai not that .
what am i gonna do out there , ray ? i cannot go home to my mama like this . i will get the strap for sure .
come on , biscuit , this is good news . your mama s gonna break down in tears when you show up on her doorstep .
not for me , it ai not .
well you cannot stay here , biscuit . this ai not no life for a man . any one of these fellas would give their right arm to be in your shoes . i sure know i would .
we played down in jackson yesterday . heard a rumor you have got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton .
you probably mean cannot get right . that is him over there .
cannot get right ? that is the kid s name ? can i talk to him ?
you can try , but you will not get too far . why you interested ?
crawford s are always looking for new talent .
maybe you did not notice , but this is a prison .
there are ways around that . right sergeant ?
kid s getting out . i got him a pardon .
yeah , but what about me and ray ? i did not see our names on that pardon . you said you were gonna put in a good word for us .
i did , claude . i mentioned you . i mentioned you both . but the fact is , pardons do not come cheap . the kid can hit . what can you do ?
but you cannot .
at least the kid s getting out . is not this what you wanted ?
is spanky here ?
no , but . . .
then that is the problem ?
do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door .
but this is where the action is and i have to be where the action is . look , when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes , did not i come through for you ? ai not she stepping in style now ?
yeah . . .
well , alright then . what do you think about this new tie ?
sharp .
i look good tonight . and i feel lucky , too .
my name s yvette . sylvia sent me . you look just like she said .
she is alright , is not she ?
oh , she is fine . she is just not coming today .
why not ?
she got married last month .
married ?
real nice guy , too . trumpet player . they moved down to new orleans .
but i am not on the outside . i am in here .
i know she is sorry she will not be seeing you anymore . anyway , she wanted me to take care of you .
take care of me ?
you know , go to the tonk or whatever .
i am too old for you . besides , i am not much in the mood .
want me to come back some other time ?
nice girl like you do not belong in a place like this . but if you talk to sylvia , tell her old claude said congratulations .
yes , boss .
you know , i am fixing on retiring at the end of the summer , gonna try to enjoy what few years i have left . what do you think of this place ? it is one of those new retirement communities down on the gulf .
that is alright , boss . takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings .
you been on the farm for quite a spell , have not you ?
over forty years now . me and ray gibson out there .
it is a hell of a lot longer when you are innocent .
half the men in this prison swear they are innocent . do not you think that is kinda funny ?
you have to forgive me if i do not laugh .
yes , sir .
i will be right back .
goodnight , claude .
he is right , gibson . put down the gun and we will work this out .
sure , boss .
i am not your boss . not anymore .
he do not sound like he is from round here .
you think you could make an exception just this once , boss ? she came all the way down from new york .
i do not need the baptists on my back , but i suppose i could issue a temporary marriage license for a nominal fee .
here !
as a pair of fur lined bedroom slippers , boss .
we will see what those slippers feel like after , say , hours . and if you step down off them bottles if one toe so much as touches the dirt one of these boys is gonna shoot you dead . let s see . we need a special man for this job .
claude . here s to your new job down at the bank . i always knew you would make something of yourself .
know what i am going to buy with my first pay check ?
i was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring , claude .
that is what respectable folks do . get a job , get married , start having babies . that is what you want , is not it ?
sure it is . i just do not see any reason to rush into things . damn , look at this shirt . i will be right back .
but i am having a good time . . .
of course i did . he said he would file an appeal right away . you did not tell me he was so good looking .
yeah , that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains . i hope he do not mess things up .
he seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me . his offices take up an entire floor of that big , new building on th street , and he was using all these words i never heard before . he even offered me a job .
a job , huh ? well , that is nice , real nice . you will not have to work long . i will be back soon enough . after i start work at first federal bank of manhattan , i will be keeping you in style . everything will get back to normal again . that is a promise .
ray gibson ? no , no . he is the reason i am in here , daisy . for all i know , he is got a record a mile long . i got a better shot of getting out of here on my own . you tell maynard to think about me , concentrate on me . understand ?
sure , claude , whatever you say .
that is because i have never been here before .
i am sylvia . that is your name ?
i know it begins with a c . . .
well , mr . c , how about buying a girl a drink ? two bourbons .
i really should not . i gotta keep an eye on my friend .
he looks like he can take care of himself .
you are cute . you have any money , claude ?
ten dollars . but i need it to get home .
why would you want to go home ? it is so early .
i do not think so .
sure i do . that is your name again ?
claude banks .
claude banks . how could i forget that ? you have got to remember me . ray gibson . we went to high school together .
you went to monroe ?
that is right ! good old monroe . . .
good old monroe .
i do not see where that is any of your business .
did those two muscle heads shake you down ? swear i have seen them down at the track with sure shot riley . that is it , ai not it ? a gambling debt .
probably to spanky s headquarters down at the pier .
good , i am looking forward to meeting this spanky . give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess .
i cannot wait to see that . you slay me , man .
you ? dine and ditch , right ? over ten bucks ? you are probably looking at a thumb .
a thumb ? what do you mean , like cut it off ? for ten bucks ? that include the tip ?
look , man , i do not want friendly conversation . i do not want to be your friend . i have seen your friends and i do not like them . i just want to do this thing and get back to new york in time to start my job .
start your job ? what kind of job ?
well , if you must know , bank teller at first federal of manhattan . i am responsible for keeping track of hundreds , occasionally thousands of dollars .
that is some long green .
damn straight , it is . i got my own set of keys because i am supposed to open up . so if i ai not there a . m . monday morning , there s gonna be hell to pay .
nothing .
no , tell me that is so funny .
i do not know . bank teller . sounds like ladies work to me .
well , maybe i should dig around in other people s clothes for money . it is obviously been highly successful for you .
hey , you would be surprised what you find in other people s pockets . just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers . get you every time .
i did not start out to be a bank teller . i was gonna be a ballplayer . even had an offer to play short for the newark eagles .
why did not you take it ?
the negro league do not pay so good . and you are always on the road . that do not wash with daisy .
you gave up baseball to be a bank teller ? i cannot latch on to that .
at some point a mangs got to get serious about his future . i am sure you have no idea what i am talking about .
you are talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller .
bank teller s just a start . i got plans . real plans . not opening some zoom boom room . this time next year i will be a loan officer .
a loan officer ?
that is right , a loan officer .
so you mean , if i needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running , i would have to hype some square like you ?
uh huh .
you need collateral .
like this ?
that thing ? who would you steal it from ?
my daddy gave me this watch .
yeah ? who would he steal it from ?
my daddy is dead so watch your mouth . you can say what you want about me , but do not be dragging my daddy into it . this watch means the world to me . solid gold . keeps perfect time .
looks like a fake to me . loan denied !
there is no boom boom room .
when there is , you can forget about it . and i swear to god , you ever talk about my daddy again i am gonna kick your bank telling , loan denying ass , you got me ?
oooh . . .
i think i liked you better when you kept your trap shut .
are you kidding ? tell me you do not want a slice of that pie right over there .
i must have left my appetite outside , which is where i think we ought to be right now .
look , ma am , we have been driving all day . we would just like to purchase one of those pies and we will be on our way .
do not uncle claude me . you get a load of those crackers ? could not be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of em . why you want to pick a fight with people like that for ?
you are soft .
what would you say ?
hey , man , do not ever call me that .
i call it like i see it , and what i see is definitely soft .
yeah , i want some pie .
okay then , i am gonna walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie .
what gave you that idea ?
oh , i do not know , maybe because our lives depend on it , i just sort of thought you knew what you were doing !
do not get all agitated on me . i bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes , i heard em talking . . .
let me get this straight . we drove all the way down to klan country cause you heard a couple of guys talking ?
what are you complaining about ? it worked out . everything s cool . now , come on , let s head down there and see that is shaking . we deserve a little reward .
reward ?
there are people down there having fun . i want to be one of them . i want you to be one of them . on monday you can be a bank teller if you want , but tonight you are a bootlegger with a truck full of puerto rican rum and a fistful of cash .
here i am .
guess we better get going , huh ?
still got that ten dollars ?
well , not exactly . see , i met this girl . real nice girl . god fearing girl . her name s sylvia .
that jelly you were talking to right here ?
she is in a tight spot . her mama needs this operation , and they ai not got the money for it . their church took up a collection but they were still short . . .
so you made a generous contribution .
what can i say ? when the spirit moves me .
that was mighty charitable of you , claude . looks like we both got fucked tonight .
what are you talking about ?
while you were upstairs doing god s work , i was getting jack legged by a fool with four threes .
you lost all our money in a card game ?
he even got my daddy s watch .
fuck that cheap ass watch i mean , how the hell are we gonna get home without any money ?
we have still got cases of rum . that is better than money .
he is dead .
oh , man , i have never seen a dead body before !
it ai not here .
what ai not there ?
my daddy s watch . this is the dude i was telling you about
winston . his name s winston .
come on , ray , better get winston back to the truck .
hell with him then . if he cannot share the driving , he cannot ride in the truck .
spanky s gonna be pissed ? poor spanky . fuck spanky ! what the hell kind of a name is spanky , anyway ? you are responsible for this situation . i blame you for everything . if it was not for you , i would be home having a hot meal right now .
if it was not for me , you would be washing up on the beach at coney island right now . i need all my thumbs and fingers for praying and doing good .
life ? ! that is life mean ? there s no way i can do life . i got a job starts monday morning !
shut up . it is too damn hot . what do you know , anyway ?
somebody just told me he wins the three legged race every year .
so ?
he does it all by himself .
the fork is the least of your worries , claude .
what about you , radio ?
pack of lies . do not listen to him . we did not kill nobody . we were railroaded . and we gonna prove that .
he just blocked it out . nigger s crazy . he is the one who did all the stabbing . he is capable of some heinous shit . how about him down there ?
wait up there , claude . you give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you will be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails .
so ?
you know what i am saying .
yeah , i know what your saying . and i am saying if you made it that far , they would be watching every train that pulls out of that station .
that is why we will not take the train . cookie showed me where there s a farm house . they got a boat there .
what do you know about boats ? i bet you cannot even swim .
why are you always talking about we ? there is no we . there is a me , there is a you . but there is no we between us .
no , i do not like it here . look around . there s nothing but ass . male ass ! balls and ass ! believe you me , i am getting out of here .
what does that mean ?
forget it .
i am not gonna forget it . what does that mean ? if you have got a plan , i think i have a right to know about it . i told you my plan .
getting a map from a chubby chef named cookie ? dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm eaten boat ? that ai not a plan , that is a vacation for two in the hole . when you have got a map to new york city , you get back to me .
gimme that . that does not concern you .
i am sure it do not .
claude .
sure is hot today . think it will rain later ?
what do you want , claude ?
what do i want ? what makes you think i want something ?
my daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet .
your daddy must have been a helluva guy , a deep man , a wise man . sure wish i could have met him
cut the bullshit . what do you want , claude ?
you still got that map ?
yeah .
well , if you are still thinking about booking it , i want in . i think we can make it .
we ? did i hear you say we ? as i recall , you are the one who said there is no we . guess we got some bad news in that letter , huh ?
look , my cousin maynard is a lawyer . he filed an appeal on my behalf
on your behalf . what happened to we ?
the appeal was denied . then daisy went and fell for maynard . they are engaged to be married , can you believe that ?
well , let s just think about that for a moment . he is a successful lawyer up in new york city and you are down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business . eeny , meeny , miney , maynard .
come on , man . do not shut me out . i am telling you , you and me , that map , we can go places .
you know what , claude ? this whole time we have been down here , you have done nothing but think about yourself , acting like this whole thing is my fault . that plan with your cousin , did that include me ?
at least you are honest for once . so now you want to be my friend ? well , let me tell you something , claude my shit do not stink banks . you got a lot to learn about friendship .
does that mean i am in ?
i do not think so , claude . you would just slow me down . we would have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware . there s no way around it , you are soft .
what would you say ?
i said you are soft .
do not call me that . you know i hate it when you call me that .
new york s a long way s off . let s just keep moving , okay ?
absolutely . the map is very clear .
let me take a look at that map .
cookie did not draw it . i did .
you drew this ? !
i knew you would not come if i did not have a map .
that gripes my soul , man . we are out here in the middle of nowhere . there is shit nibbling at my balls ! do not tell me you do not know where we are going !
i am stuck !
hell , you would probably be half way to new york by now . . .
i am serious , man . do not mention it . ever .
he would be doing me a favor . i am getting outta here one way or the other ! goddamn rats and shit ! fuck !
how the fuck are we gonna do that , ray ? !
say what ?
that is right , we will get off at the next stop . the traings pulling into the station right now .
the hell you talking about ? what train ?
we are in the bronx , my man . hundred and sixty first street .
hell , yes , yankee stadium . bombers are playing a double header against the red sox .
red sox . . . who s on the mound ?
i do not know . who do you want ?
allie reynolds . he is my boy .
sure , it says allie reynolds right here in the program . he is warming up right now . man , we are so close to the field i need cleats . how would you get such good seats ?
i know people .
they must be the right people . whoa , there goes the hot dog man . let s get a couple . damn , that smells good . nothing like a ballpark hot dog , huh ?

do not matter who camp puts on the mound . all i know is when this seasongs over camp s gonna have pork chops .
so , blocker , what do you think of our boy ?
we are like his handlers . he cannot function without us .
damn straight . i expect those pittsburgh crawdads to remember that .
crawfords .
whatever .
let me see that .
i am not gonna let it go . the man needs to explain himself . making promises .
make em throw strikes .
i am not in the mood right now , ray .
he said they keep it parked out behind the barn . cannot be that hard to fly a plane . lots of people do it .
they are called pilots ! i am serious , ray . i am not in the mood for one of your stupid , fucked up plans right now .
i do not see you coming up with any plans .
my plan is on his way to pittsburgh right now . that congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us , but we cannot seem to do nothing for ourselves . do not you feel a little disgusted right now ?
crop duster .
i ai not getting in no airplane with you . i am finally wrapping my mind around the concept . they threw us in this shithole for life . do not you get it , ray ? we are gonna die here ! might as well head up to the cemetery , pick a plot and start digging .
maybe you are fooling yourself , ray . maybe you are just a chip off the old block .
take that back or we ai not friends no more , claude banks .
here s a news flash , ray . we never were friends . we have just been stuck together for years . it is been nothing but bad luck since the moment i ran into you . every time i look at you i get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if i would never bumped into ray gibson .
the only thing i regret is the day i met you .
well , if that is the way it is . . .
that is the way it is .
then i have nothing left to say to you .
excuse me ? are you talking to me ?
i would have knocked you off those bottles , put a bullet in your ass and be half way to new york right now .
after all these years of blissful silence , i almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be .
i hope you do not think i owe you anything . because i do not owe you a damn thing .
i did not do if for you , anyway . i just ai not no boot licking trusty , that is all .
that was five years ago .
i know , but since we are talking , i thought i would mention it .
we are not talking , you are talking , and doing too damn much of it , if you ask me .
you sure looked funny running for those pies , bullets flying all around you .
bullets were not the problem . that pie was too hot . burned my tongue .
he is just a lonely old man . he likes to talk .
hey , i am a lonely old man . i like to talk , too . so why do not we start by talking about what kind of a plan you are working on ?
i am not working on a plan .
you cannot fool me , claude . i know you got something brewing .
goodnight , ray .
do not touch that car .
you have not driven in years , you ai not even got a license . mangs taking his life in his hands , putting you behind the wheel ! where you taking him ?
greenville . we are picking up the new superintendent at the bus station .
what the hell are you doing in that trunk ? !
you did not think i was gonna let you escape alone , did you ?
i ai not escaping ! we are picking up the new super just like i told you .
then you are lucky i came along . does not take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this . now help me out of this trunk .
you ai not getting out of that trunk .
come on , man , i am starting to cramp up here . we have the chance right here , right now , i say we go !
go where , ray ?
back to new york for starters .
and what will we do when we get there ? i am sixty five years old , ray . so are you . what are we gonna do out here ? get married , have kids , settle down ? that boat sailed without us , man .
this boat s gonna sail without you , too . i do not care if i last one day out here . at least it is one day of freedom . now gimme those keys .
forget about that . you run if you want to , but you are not taking this car .
claude , man , i am serious . give me those keys .
i ai not spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride .
do not make me take them away from you .
hey , there s wilkins !
some faces you just do not forget . warren pike s is one of em .
i do not like it , i do not like it one bit . we shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity . we would be half way to new york by now .
we would be in the hole by now . hey , man , you are peeing on my shoe .
i know . simultaneously , they shake and zip . claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo , placing it on a tray next to an identical one .
he is got my daddy s watch , claude . i always knew whoever took that watch killed winston hancock . and that was you , mr . pike .
no , believe me , i am gonna kill him !
that is because you are soft . gimme the gun .
what would you say ?
i said you are soft .
do not call me soft , i hate it when you call me that .
he knows nobody wants to hear the truth .
an erection , huh ? have not had one of those in a while .
tell me about it . scared me at first . then , before i could figure out what to do with it , it was gone . imagine my disappointment .
well , ruth shoulda built it a little better . damn thing s falling to pieces . gonna hurt somebody .
what do you expect ? it is almost as old as we are .
they oughta tear that shit down and ship them yankees cross the river to jersey .
remember what that place looked like on a sunny spring day ? more beautiful than any church i was ever in .
course i was right . about what ?
you are the one who said that boneyard s the only way we are getting out of here . we are gonna join all the rest of em soon enough . jangle leg , biscuit , goldmouth , poker face , cookie , radio yes sir , pick a plot and start digging . . .
shh ! is that so hard to believe ?
do not tell me , i do not want to hear it . it is probably all fucked up , anyway .
you do not want to hear it , you do not want to hear it . there s no shame in that .
it is too late for plans .
never thought i would hear ray gibson say that . hell with you then . you would only slow me down anyway .
why the hell not ?
i saw that hot dog guy in the bathroom urinating . he did not wash his hands .
you did not get ketchup ?
gimme that damn thing .
hell of a day , ray . yankees are on fire .
so ?
they are touching .
yeah ? you and what army ?
next thing , you are gonna be complaining about the seats .
well , if you must know , they could be closer .
damn , i shoulda let spanky johnson drown you in the river when i had the chance .
i am sorry , he is on medication . . .
i am all right .
you ever done time before ?
you kidding ? i have been in and out of prison my entire life . mostly in . i am hard core .
then you will not have no problem making the adjustment . you need anything , help of any kind , gimme a holler . name s jangle leg .
preciate it . claude .
i try to moisturize regularly .
creamed chip beef on toast . except we are outta beef , so i had to improvise .

those are for trusties , unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs .
you killed santa claus ?
grandma dodi s pork rib joint .
well , not yet . it is still in the planning stages .
made just for you , cookie .
how about some steak sauce ?
no problem . oh , boy !
why ai not that pick swinging ?
listen up , jiggaboo ! state of mississippi ai not interested in your . . . in your . . . metropolitan assets !
tell him the state of mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown .
state of mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown . you got that ? !
new york . that is up north , ai not it ? they will find we do things different down here .
judge gave em the long ride .
life , huh ? they step outta line again , we will shorten up that sentence real fast .
you heard the boss ! let s move !
move it out .
moving it out , boss .
that is right . we do not need no fences , we have the gun line . it runs from shack to shack clear around the yard . you are now inside the gun line . . .
you heard what the man said ! move it !
my corn bread ? oh no , my friend . i love corn bread .
just because it is in my mind , goldmouth , do not mean it ai not real . everything worth anything starts with a dream .
he is a good friend of mine . drops by the club whenever he is in town .
hey , ray . . .
c mon , goldmouth , somebody s gotta watch the front door .
come on , old timer , hook the brothers up .
i seen the bodies before they sealed em up . them fellas sizzled up good . looked like some shit from the x files . damn , that shit is nasty .
no , they did not get their pardons , you dumb shit ! if they would got their pardons way back then , we would not be burying them today , would we ?
oh , right . well , why did not they get those pardons ?
what happened to em after that , willie ?
hell , no ! i just got something in my eye .
i think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago . come on , let s get this over with .
i was already here a good many years when they came in in .
? that is like , that is like . . .
sixty five years ago . they always said the farm could not hold em forever . looks like you are finally free , boys .
what were they , bootleggers ?
just like elvis .
of course nobody believed ray and claude .
hey , willie , what was claude s plan , anyway ?
nothing to it , really . claude figured they could steal a couple of bodies from the morgue . they got a couple of crackers working there do not know their asses from their elbows . then they was gonna set fire to the infirmary and make it look like those bodies was them that got stuck inside . claude figured during the commotion , it would not be too hard to slip onto one of the fire trucks and hang tight until it rolled right on out of here in the morning .
rayford !
i heard some things so i went to see spanky johnson . he told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here . what happened to your face ?
do not worry about that . hey , fellas , this here is my mama . these are some of my friends . that is willie , there s poker face , radio , cookie , goldmouth , biscuit , jangle leg .
do not cry , mama . this place ai not so bad as it looks . sure , we work hard , but there s plenty fresh air and sunshine . . . and you know something else , i have taken to going to church regular . they got services every sunday right there in the mess hall .
do not you lie to me , rayford . you still have your daddy s watch ? well , this is all i can give you . i wish it was more .
do not argue with me . you need it more than i do . i know how a little money can help in a place like this .
do not say that , rayford . do not ever say that . he gave up hope . that is where you gotta be different .
they gave me life , mama .
i gave you life . and they cannot take it away from you . remember that . you will get outta here someday . i believe that . you gotta believe it , too .
hey , where is claude ? i do not see claude !
stay calm , ray . we will find him . claude ! has anyone seen claude ?
he must still be in there .
it will be too late .
you cannot go in there , ray ! you will never make it !
i am going in for him . he would do the same for me .
i prefer bourbon .
i am sorry , i do not keep any liquor in the house .
well , fortunately , i carry my own .
you do not have to twist my arm . say now , that gumbo has quite a kick .
thank you , claude . that will be all for tonight .
i believe in treating the convicts with respect , if that is what you mean .
respect ? well , is not that progressive .
if somebody deserves respect , mr . pike , they receive it from me , convict or no convict .
i am afraid i am gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners .
do you realize what your saying , gibson ?
what difference does it make ? natchez was better off without winston hancock ! who cares if a couple of no account bootleggers went to jail for his killing ? at least the state of mississippi got years of cheap labor out of the deal !
excuse me , sheriff . as we explained to your associate here , there s been a mistake . we did not kill anybody . now , as for the bootlegging , we happen to work for a very important man in new york .
are you offering me a bribe ?
i am just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice .
you may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in new york city , but down here we take murder seriously .
that is a real nice watch you got there , sir . fancy old thing even plays a little tune .
yeah , it is special . they do not make em like this anymore .
sure do not . mind if i ask where you got it ?
why , my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back .
something like that , yes .
she give you that scar , too ?
like you shot winston hancock ?
shoot him , wilkins !
goddamn it , wilkins , would you please just shoot the nigger !
he shoots me , i swear i will take you with me ! i just want to hear you say it .
jenny ?
no , it says marleen here .
anybody else need anything read ?
they are called subways . a nickel will take you from one end of manhattan to the other . helluva ride , too .
satchmo .
greenville , that the nearest town ?
sure i have been to the cotton club . it is pretty sweet . but it do not hold a candle to the boom boom room . that is where the real action is .
you mean the boom boom room ?
that is it . the boom boom room . sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running .
you should have come by last night , radio . you woulda had yourself some fun .
me ? willie long .
what are you in for , willie ?
that is a long story . . .
you all been here a long time . does not anybody ever escape from this place ?
they run but they never get too far .
that is my joint . the swinginest nightclub in town .
i am talking about old satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint .
they will be sending you up there soon enough . and not just for a visit , neither .
i slipped in a couple of bottles of my latest batch . help wash down all them pills they will be giving you .
you found him .
that is natchez under the hill .
blacks welcome there ?
greengs the only color that matters under the hill . they got gambling , girls . you oughta check it out .
maybe we will . nice meeting you .
but you do . what does that say about you , ray ? what does that say about me ? i have given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father . but he did not last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so i guess i am gonna have to school you myself .
come on , spank , i am just trying to get by here . you remember how it was when you were starting out .
puerto rican rum . see for yourself .
comes up the mississippi . i can get more . a lot more . i was thinking about going into business for myself , but under the circumstances , i would be willing to take on a partner .
all i need is the front money and a truck . i could be back in two , three days tops if i had somebody to share the driving .
understood .
alright , ray , you have got a deal . pick your man and get going .
if i was you , i would want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot .
i just want somebody who will not put a bullet in my back once the truck is full .
you should not have come here .
please , get out of my mind !
he is sick ?
yeah , he needs souls to live . when you guys left , you broke the gates . we gotta get the gates burning again before he dies .
well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him .
how about this ? i stay here enjoying my schnapps and you go back .
let her go .
i hear a train coming . drink .
hey , that is dad s throne ! how did adrian get that ? is dad okay ?
adrian , i am asking you nicely , in the name of all that is good release my friends and get in the flask .
is this a joke ?
no . it is the inner light . and with it we can defeat anything you have got .
absolutely not .
i have been waiting on this day for ten thousand years .
and he is dead serious .
it is just such a slap in the face .
yeah , get out of here ! beat it !
could you concentrate for five seconds ?
i am concentrating . where can we rule ?
what do you think about . . . earth ?
you saying we go up there and kill everyone ?
eventually , cassius . but first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them . . .
. . . their damned souls will be ours .
it is our time , brother .
well , we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our new hell . how are things going down at city hall ?
i lowered the drinking age to ten .
brilliant . this is so much fun . i never want it to end .
why should it end ? who s gonna stop us ?
all right . let me out .
you know , new hell really only needs one new satan .
you mother . . .
i was going to let you out , eventually , cassius . i swear .
do not do it !
noon . . .
sure , why not ?
weed lowers the body temperature . i read that . . . in , uh . . . er , science magazine .
or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity .
uh . no it will not ?
urr . . . uggg . . . errr . . .
i am calling you out , brother . . .
you want a queen ? got one right here .
so excited .
try four and a half . at first i totally did not like him .
you know , we saw you save your girlfriend s life .
show him central park .
i would totally love to go there . but i hear it is really hard to get in .
maybe try the opposite of that .
my brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat . which would explain my chronic halitosis .
a mountain goat ? that is really sweet .
my mom was not a goat ?
try an angel .
an angel ?
unh huh . which would make you half angel .
well , she was about six three , only spoke portuguese and had really long grey hair .
angels do not get any older , son .
it was a long time ago , at some heaven and hell mixer .
well tell her i said hi back .
we can see that is going on anywhere on earth . look .
she is so nice .
yeah , you do . . .
stronger , yes . smarter , definitely . but you have something he does not have .
a speech impediment ?
i am not a hundred percent on that . god said when the time comes , you will know what to do .
it would be so okay .
you are already there . . .
trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on earth .
no .
he will be here . just keep your cool , kid .
i cannot screw . i cannot screw .
that turn you on there , rupaul ?
i just need to find my brothers and be on my way , beefy .
it is not gonna be easy . your brothers can possess people . so they probably will not look like themselves . you have to be suspicious of everyone .
it is not me , moron .
oh . sorry .
it is freezing up here , beefy .
you are on earth now , kid . gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has . we will stop by k mart . get you some warm clothes .
i also have this odd pain in my mid section . kind of a hollow feeling . . .
that pain is hunger .
put it in your mouth .
it sure is . now eat it up . you are gonna need your energy .
i got energy up the ying ying . let s get cracking !
great . now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the upper east side . but i misplaced it .
got ya . is it okay if i do the sleep thing ?
look , it is okay for me to shit the street . but you gotta use a toilet .
okay , just point me in the right direction next time .
come on , there s like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking .
well , let s rock and roll .
i think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects . now i am going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown .
what can i do about it ?
you cannot do jack shit . . . unless you learn your evil powers .
nobody s as evil as my brothers . those dudes put the wick in wicked .
go get a soda out of the fridge .
but those are my roommate s sodas . . .
but those are my roommate s sodas . . . does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make ?
release the evil ?
i am just saying , there s wickedness in you . . . i can tell from your snores .
maybe you love her . but what do i know ? i am baked out of my mind .
the shit has hit the fan , kid . take a look .
look . you were really high . things happen .
i was with valerie , i swear . this is adriangs work . i have got to find him .
i think you are looking at him .
he superimposed your head onto scarface .
everything s fine , pop .
last time you said that the renaissance happened .
please , pop , just go back to your room .
can i take him with me and have sex with his head ?
sure , pop . whatever you want .
c mon , man , i am just asking for one superbowl ring .
in exchange for eternal damnation of your soul ? you are too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you , mr . marino .
you did it for namath .
yeah , but joe was coming here anyways . just go back to earth and enjoy your records and the hall of fame and the beautiful family and all that .
this is bullshit , man . i am gonna win the superbowl this year , with or without you !
now you are talking .
yes , jimmy .
oh , and do not forget , you are shoving a pineapple up hitler s ass at four o clock .
now he is got no ears ! you happy , nicky ? your father s got no ears !
put it back on my head . i am falling apart here .
he is got til midnight tonight , nicky . you get your ass back up there . you save your father !
cassius , did not i tell you to stay out of your brother s mind ?
hey , dad , i am almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape . i really think it is a masterpiece .
okay , kid , we will listen to it later .
do not worry about coming up with anything . it is cool .
such a sweet boy . but after much thought and careful consideration , i have decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be . . . me .
the important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil . and i do not think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet . you need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time .
definitely .
i do not care what kind of mood you are in at the start of that song . when it is over , that mood has been altered . wow . great shit . that is next ?
well , i thought that after messing with your head , i would give you a little kick in the keester .
metallica , dad . come on .
i was just playing with you .
and i also happen to be a jets fan .
how bad ?
i am gonna die , nicky . if the gates are broken , no new souls can get in , which means i will start to deteriorate into nothing .
so go get em , dad !
i am too weak . the process has already begun .
are you telling me i have to go to earth and kill my brothers ?
son , just do your best .
well , i guess i am going to have to take a mulligan on this one .
please , nicky , get back up there . try to hurry .
what are you gonna do ? look at me , nicky ! i got no legs , i got no hips , i got one ear . . .
i cannot hear you , nicky . i cannot hear anything !
i came through for you , mom and the butterflies , dad .
you are back in hell now , kid . there s no butterflies here . if you want butterflies , you need to be on earth .
what about you and grandpa and everyone in hell ?
nicky , i let my butterflies die once upon a time and it is never stopped hurting . that is right , you heard me , holly . i am still in love with you .
i will , dad . but in the words of motley crue , this will always be my . . . home sweet home . . .
coulda been much worse .
that is what i am thinking . . .
that is a pretty brassiere .
thanks .
could you maybe not tell anyone about this ?
you got it . could you maybe not tell anyone about this ?
you got it .
beast .
i know , your wickedness .
i started slow , though . for years , i was just giving people hot foots . actually , you can give all the credit for hell to my first wife she was the inspiration . she was an ugly one , too . one day , she asked me if i wanted super sex . i said i will take the soup .
it is stanley , sir .
nothing . no mountains . no castles . looked like a giant parking lot . it was not even called hell .
what was it called , sir .
boogerland !
that is nice , grandpa . why do not you just enjoy the fishing ?
i cannot enjoy anything . i go fishing . i catch nothing . i go to orgies , i catch everything . . .
your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room .
okay , but jimmy , when the house is rocking , do not forget the knocking !
we gotta get this bad boy burning again . ideas ?
i am just a demon , nicky . i do not got devil blood in me . i would last two minutes up there with your brothers .
you are not saying it is up to me ?
you are the spawn of satan . you got it in you .
i got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal .
i gotta say this cake tastes a little funny .
by she , do you mean he ?
no .
oh , would you grow up .
of course you do , tommy tune .
about time . . .
mr . sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side .
gotta be one of his disciples or something .
should we wake him up ?
yeah . you do it .
the dark prince is here .
six , six , six , pick up sticks .
we are going to see ozzy play at the meadowlands , right now . wanna come , nicky ?
little nervous . wanna puke .
we know where to find nicky .
peppermint . . . alright .
cannot beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this ?
that way .
absolutely nothing . the blizzard always came straight with his messages . but wrap your minds around this one .
not again , fellas . it kind of hurts .
whoa , that chick must be the real deal , then . later on .
see ya , fellas .
oh , that is terrible , reege . . .
so i followed him . . .
you followed him ?
i followed him all the way downtown , and when he gets out of the car , i reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat .
you keep a bat under your seat ?
recently , yes ! so i run up behind this guy , and start bashing his brains in with this bat , and it made me feel happy ! did you ever see the untouchables ?
yes , great movie . . .
i was deniro !
all right . . .
dude , it is us . let us in .
dude . seriously ?
yes . i will meet you at grand central at noon . okay . do me . i command you .
i will just go to heaven .
you smell like coconuts .
it is comptoir sud pacific . makes me feel like a hula girl . which is kinda what i am going for . wanna come in ?
no thanks . i am looking for a girl named valerie who also smells like coconuts .
valerie doran ? two floors up , one window over .
thanks , much . good luck with the genital tucking .
i do not need luck . i am good .
andrew .
oh . sorry , andrew . valerie ?
that is okay . i get messed with all the time and when i saw him doing that to you i just lost it . i hate when people take advantage of tourists . it ruins it for the rest of us .
you think i am a tourist ?
i am sorry . i just assumed . your accent maybe . where are you from ?
the south .
really ?
yeah . deep south . she laughs along with him , not sure why .
why are you laughing ?
i do not know , but i like it . say . your glasses are nice . they make your eyes look sparkly and big . it is fun to look at them .
my dad s an optometrist .
my dad s in hell , and he is falling apart .
i am sorry . it is really tough when your parents get older .
if i do not save him , i do not know what i am gonna do .
well , i am sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out .
that is alright . i already ate lunch . i actually would not mind getting a gelati .
could i come with you to getting a gelati ?
if you want to .
want to ? a million angry octopus people could not hold me back !
octopus people ?
uh , it is a deep south expression .
it is not that cold . here , let me wrap it .
i have an apartment . i do not remember exactly where . my dog knows , though .
you have a dog ? what kind ?
i am not sure . i would ask him , but he is uptown talking to his contacts .
school ?
parsons school of design . i knew growing up i was not much to look at , so i put my energy into making things that are pretty .
that is that pleasant smell coming from , your skin ?
my perfume ?
sometimes , sure .
good . i was concerned .
basically , yeah .
wow . maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles .
thanks much . you know that is nice about you , valerie ?
what ?
what was that ?
i . . . i do not know why i just said that . i meant to say that . . .
nicky ? oh my god . stay right there .
i am not sure , but it did not involve getting blinded with poison .
are you dead ?
no .
what are you doing ?
i think i am floating .
why would you be floating ?
i do not know . maybe it is because of your sweet voice .
am i supposed to not be freaked out right now ? because i am .
that was not me . i was being possessed by my brother , adrian . he is the one who call you a gross pig .
what do you mean , possessed ?
remember when i told you my dad was in hell ?
yes . . .
well , that is because he is the devil . and he wants to keep his throne for another ten thousand years . which is fine with me , but not with my brothers , so they broke out of hell , causing my dad . . .
. . . the devil ? . . .
. . . to decompose . and i love my dad very much . so i came to earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and i met you and . . . well , my dog tells me i just might be in love with you .
okay , i do . get back up here .
next time . tonight , i want to share the most beautiful thing i could possibly imagine .
east rutherford .
mister crowley , that is inside of your head . . .
i have to , valerie .
that was cassius !
from my dad s side of the family .
i love you .
i love you .
uh , do not you want to know what the rent is ?
eight hundred , split down the middle . tuesdays and thursdays i rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits .
off limits .
right . and as far as household items we can share the soap , but we will split the cost . cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap should not have to pay as much as the other guy . are not you boiling in that outfit ?
no .
it is like eighty degrees in this hallway . you from the south ?
yeah . the deep south .
i do not know .
and sorry , man , but no dogs allowed .
a black guy ?
if it is cassius , yes .
why ? did she hurt you ? do you miss her ? need a shoulder to cry on ?
i have always wanted to kill someone . can i do it ?
see something you like , my man ?
yes . i would like my flask back .
no , i am just calling you . . . a guy who has my flask .
and if that is your so called flask , how would i have it unless i was , in fact , a thief ?
i do not know ?
sir , i would prefer if you did not raise your voice . it is making my muscles tighten .
i cut up a sandman yesterday . they said i would never get him . . . but i cut him up good , i did .
i feel sorry for you , boy !
no , for you ! how old are you , billy ?
nothing will happen ! i make the rules as i go ! ! cubs do what i say ! always have ! always will ! i got cathedral and i will never let go !
no cubs over fifteen , billy ! ever heard of a cub with a green flower ? you will leave cathedral then , billy , when you are on green , because they will not let a green stay here . if you try to stay the young ones will gut rip you apart !
shut up ! shut up your damn mouth !
all right what are you ?
your turn .
anything to eat ?
you walked in . i saw you . do not you remember ?
from ? from ? from ?
we were sent here and you know it . others have been sent here . where are they ? hiding ?
where do we go ? ! where do we go from here ? ? ! !
you know about sanctuary ! i know you do ! you have to help us ! you do not have a choice ! it is not your decision ! ! tell us .
never a pair . i have never had a pair .
where do you send them ?
you are a beautiful pair .
do you know how long all this will last ? not thirty years . . . or thirty thousand years . . . but thirty thousand years . . . and you will be part of it . ages will roll . . . ages . and you will be here . . . the two of you . . . eternally frozen . . . frozen . . . beautiful .
there must be somebody else up here . i cannot believe that he is
let me sculpt you and i will show you where the others have gone .
that is better . how do you want us ?
nude . imagine , a pair .
it will be all right . . .
up there .
wait for the wind ! wait and hear the birds sing over you !
we are ready .
regular storage procedure . . . the same as the other food . . . the other food stopped coming and they started .
what other food ?
fish and plankton , sea greens and protein from the sea . it is all here ready fresh as harvest day . fish and plankton , sea greens and protein from the sea . . . and then it stopped coming and they . . . . . . came instead . so i store them here . i am ready . and you are ready . it is my job protein , plankton , grass from the sea .
thanks . i thought you would be older . i expected a red .
i am .
your own work ?
and i did it myself right on there .
just the face .
fine . . . holly will get you ready . you are in good hands , believe me .
i do not care . . . just get it over with .
hurry . . . hurry . . . hurry .
turn this way . no , no . . . not you . . . you !
open your eyes once , idiot . it is not every day that a sandman son is born . i am telling you , francis that is him !
maybe , maybe not . that is the difference ? come on , logan , let s get out of here before everybody finds out .
even the alarm did not wake him .
has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are ?
not in my time . . .
just wondered . . . what happens ?
dunno . . . flameout maybe . whatever happens , you can bet it is final . but who would want to find out ?
well , why not ! ? that is exactly how everything works . how else could the city stay in balance you have a better idea ?
no , but at least i wonder sometimes instead of doing that one for one song of yours . you sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape .
well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering . you know , logan you wonder a lot . too much for a sandman .
i never even visited nursery before tonight . when you wonder , it slows you up you know ?
of course not ! i am curious , not sick .
well . . . you cannot have them all .
what an old , old man you are getting to be , francis . were not you ever a yellow ? i bet you were even wilder than come on , sandman .
come on . i do not want to miss the filing in . there will be some i know tonight , i think . . .
only a few ? you are just not trying .
i am in my party mood .
yes . but you look a little rusty to me what were you doing , wondering ?
you ? why ? you are already beautiful .
no it is that last runner someone in was trying to help him .
did you ever see anybody renew ?
i think you have been skulling out too much . first nursery and now stupid questions .
did you ?
of course .
anybody we know ?
look . . . why do not you get into the water . . . you need it . . . more than i do .
i am fine . . . see you . . .
at carousel tonight ?
it has nothing to do with you .
what are you talking about ? ! i saw you let a runner go ? i saw you , logan ? ? tell me ! !
i did not do anything , francis ! they have made us believe that . . .
why did you do that ? ? ? ! ! !
no , holly wait ! he is running . tell them the rest !
he is the one . you too . i remember . he was in a hurry . just a face job . dark hair , i said . then he killed doc and you grabbed me and the machine blew up and i ran . . . i ran .
holly . holly ! please . . . the other sandman . remember the one who came after
. . . and he was hunting the first one , this one . was not he ? was not he ? this one was running , the other one was hunting him . . .
yes . oh yes . he was after you . i remember . you are running !
i am mary .
where do you live , mary ?
here .
why are not you in nursery ?
i am very smart .
when do you go up ?
i never go upstairs . you are a nice old lady .
please . . . no .
no . just no .
you prefer women ?
no .
well then . . . ?
nothing . i felt sad , i put myself on the circuit . it was a mistake .
sad ? what made you sad ?
a friend of mine went on carousel tonight . now he is gone .
yes . . . probably he was renewed ?
he was killed .
killed ? why do you use that word ?
is not it right ? is not that what you do ? kill .
i never killed anybody in my life . sandmen terminate runners . who brought you ?
nobody . i felt sad . . . i put myself on the circuit .
you felt sad . that is your name ?
jessica .
you are beautiful . let s have sex .
no .
later .
no .
but you put yourself on the circuit !
i thought i had to do something .
and ?
i changed my mind .
and now ?
curious .
about what ?
how a sandman lives .
not about that .
i am listening .
i am afraid to tell you .
i am not armed . well ?
why is it wrong to run ?
you should not even think such things . . . and you picked a strange person to say them to
i suppose . but what if you want to live ?
so ? do what everyone does . try like hell for renewal .
i did not say that i would run . . . i just . . .
are you a or a ?
six . i go red next year .
you are years away . . . i do not know why you are thinking of these things , much less talking about them . want to try ?
k .
you are sure you do not want to try ?
but i was not sure you would come .
here i am . shall i come in ?
i am the most beautiful woman you have ever seen , i suppose ?
maybe . . . sure . . .
thanks . . . but i have the choice .
of course .
then it is still no .
you know .
i do not believe you . there has to be more .
all right .
i am going to run .
why tell me ?
you know something .
about running , dying what ?
both . . . running s what i am interested in .
i know what everyone knows . try like hell for renewal . you have the same chance everyone else has .
it is different now . help me .
how can i ?
a runner gave it to me .
and then you killed him , right ?
i let him go . . . believe me .
i do not . .
speak to your friends for me , jessica . . . please . . .
please ? what friends ?
i do not have much time .
i never heard of a sandman running . . . ever . . .
and i never heard of sanctuary .
what do you need ?
that is tomorrow .
i wish i could help you .
maybe you will think of something . . .
i wish i knew what you think i know .
of course
if you trusted me , you would know .
we are coming to arcade . shall we relive together ?
you are not going , are you ?
why not ? maybe she will help me . you will not . you would better stay here .
that is nice .
maybe they are angry because they are grown in meccano breeders .
instead of what ? nine months inside a woman we are all raised the same but most of us do not become cubs in cathedral .
some people say children need human mothering .
insane . nurseries are better than any mother could be .
i am only telling you what i have heard . . . have not you ever wondered what your seed mother was like . . . ?
uh uh .
i have .
when did you begin to question lastday ?
i do not remember exactly . . . except i was a green . what would you like to relive , logan ?
let s see how long has it been ?
but what is this why ?
the cubs . when they are flying on muscle there s no way to catch up . without the dazzle , they would just go past us too fast
muscle ? i do not know that one .
where ? sanctuary ? can you take me there ?
logan , i do not know where sanctuary is . but if i take you to them , they will kill you .
all right . but why ? i did not kill the runner .
yes , but they will not know that . . . or care . they are hunting you , logan . maybe me too , now . . .
that is nothing . . . there s a sandman behind us , too and there will be more soon . take me to them .
i i cannot .
then why do not you leave me go to them explain
no . not that either .
yes . i do not know what else to do with him following us . why do you keep running from your
because he is my friend and i do not want to be killed by him or anyone .
he is good , is not he ?
will he find us and kill us ? yes . . . or one of the others . you know there s only one place to go now . . .
they will not believe us .
i would rather take my chances with them . . . than with francis .
they will not listen .
you think sandmen will ? there s no other way for me ,
we will convince them .
how will they know we are coming ?
they are watching us now . they will let us in when they are sure .
why , jessica ? you are still a green .
it is the only way .
some kind of breeding pens . . . i suppose . . . they say people used to breed animals , fish , anything . . . . . . to eat , of course .
ycch . to kill things and then eat them . it must have been a savage world .
it is brighter there . . . besides , we cannot go back .
it does not make any difference anymore .
you are really one of us now , are not you ?
you knew that i was not before , did not you ? why did you stay with me ?
i wanted to . . . . . . and you . . . what made you kill sandmen ?
i had to . i did kill . . . for the first time in my life i killed .
because you felt like a runner , did not you .
i guess so . . . i know i felt something i never felt before . . . and i did not like it . . . not a bit . i will tell you one thing . . . sanctuary better be worth it . that is the last place for me to live now .
for us .
it feels like breath . it makes everything move . your hair is moving .
and yours .
we will be all right . . . we will . . .
sooner or later , we will have to try something .
why do not we rest here ? we know we can eat these .
i doubt it .
do not ever let go .
i will not .
do you think he was telling the truth ?
how would anyone know ? even if we find it we can never go back .
thirty thousand years did not last very long , did they ?
the lifeclocks have no power outside .
you know , jessica .
. . . but i still have the choice . . . ?
of course .
then the answer s yes . . .
yes , do you think that is why he looks so sad ?
beloved husband . beloved wife . what can all that mean ?
it could be . . .
he had a mother and father and he knew them .
one in a million , i suppose
you want there to be one . . . that does not . . .
there has to be ! i know it exists ! it has to ! !
no , there does not . not really just so many want it to exist . . . so many who do not want to die . . . want it so much that a place called sanctuary becomes real . but it does not exist . it never existed . just the hope .
you are wrong ! ! it has to be ! ! it just has to be ! !
he asked if we would bury him when his time comes .
we cannot . we are going back .
to what ?
i am going to try and tell people what we have seen and
you are lying ! you will never have the chance to tell anybody anything ! you will be killed the moment you are seen !
do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them ? !
things will not change . . . you know that ! we can live here together , logan . . . have a life as long as his . . . together !
things change !
you want to go back to kill , is that it ? ! now , you will want to kill your own ! ! ! kill sandmen ! ! ! killing s all you ever . . . ! ! !
i want to be alive and with you , that is all i want .
yes . you and i , jessica .
and sanctuary ?
sanctuary is the right to live . . . nothing more . but nothing less , either . . .
beloved wife . . .
it is part of the hydrogalvanic system . the ocean tides are changed into energy somehow .
is it inside the city ?
of course . i do not know where . . . i just took them for granted . it is our only chance .
but there are so many of them . do you know each one separately .
yes indeed , everyone . actually , they all have three . the naming of cats is a difficult matter . it is not just one of your holiday games . you may think at first i am mad as a hatter when i tell you a cat must have three different names . an ordinary name and a fancy name . that is two . do you want to guess what the third one is ?
yes . . .
are you sure ?
mother and father said so . . . you know ?
i do not know .
you are both full of secrets like macavity . did you steal this ?
no .
macavity , macavity , there s no one like macavity , there never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity .
all this . all of it .
what people ?
i do not know . . . but it does .
that is that ?
they are put into the ground so they can be visited by the living . . .
at least it is over . . .
we will remember . but that is a long time off . . .
where are you going ?
oh , my . . .
hello .
do you want to see doc ?
a sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else . where is the doctor ?
i like your face . would you mind if doc took a picture ? i would like him to give your face to somebody else .
it is all right with me . is he here ?
my name s holly . . . holly . in ancient times they said my number was unlucky . do you believe in luck ?
no look , i am in a hurry .
for as long as i can remember .
what kind of place is this ?
just a place , i suppose . . . who knows ?
i have always been here . . .
are there any other humans ?
gracious . . . no .
have any other people ever passed through ?
what makes you think so ?
my parents thought so . mother and father . you know ?
mother and ? you knew your mother and father ?
dead . . . they are dead . . . and buried .
no i am sorry . it is not possible .
it is not fair . i will give you one of my favorite cats . . . a jellicle cat . jellicle cats have cheerful faces , jellicle cats have bright black eyes they like to practice their airs and graces and wait for the jellicle moon to rise .
i am sorry but i do not have anything to give you .
no , no , no
did your mother or father ever mention another place ?
never , never , ever . nothing .
of course you can stay . this belongs to the people .
not yet .
all right .
what a pity . i was hoping you would be here to bury me .
alive ?
more . . . many more .
and all alive you say ?
i promise . we will go on as soon as it is light .
thank you . tell me what do those words mean ? beloved husband . . . beloved son . . . beloved wife . . .
my father was the husband and my mother was the wife . beloved is a word they used to stay together .
stay ? they lived together all their years ?
oh , yes . . . i think . . .
oh . . . i did so look forward to seeing all those people .
i am sorry .
yes . . .
can you make it back ?
oh my . . . i will try .
logan . . . francis , authorized duty quadrant . intrusion accidental .
clear logan and francis .
it does not matter who we are . follow the tunnel to the end .
will there be someone to tell us where to go from there . . . ?
no . jessica goes back now . take her back . now ! go on back . back outside , jessica .
i do not know . the cheeks maybe . . . look a little
cheeks ? cheeks ? right . too much , you think ?
too little .
too little ? too little . okay , wait for me .
you do not seem quite sure , jessica . can you do it ? will you ?
i do not think so .
good . . . you up for a drive ?
where to ? hey , lanie , i heard you were out of it for a while , too .
sheila will be at tops .

pile in .
what ?
you okay ? . . . that is wrong ?
yeah .
sure , i am okay .
this is our bedroom .
yes , i thought my wife . . .
what do you mean by that ?
how i remember them . not necessarily the way they happened .
it kept going off for some reason . false alarms .
i forgot . anyway , i hate the idea of acting paranoid .
what is ?
the angle . the high angle shot on the tape .
no . fred hates them .
maid ? relative ?
no , one of us is always here to let the maid in . nobody else has a key .
i do not know if i want to stay here . i do not feel safe .
and smooth . . . almost no movement back and forth , i mean .
like you would get if it was hand held .
right . . . this just glided along .
anybody else have a key to the house .
as best we can .
if anything else happens , you will call us .

andy s from utah . he says there you have a choice . . . you can die by hanging or by firing squad .
which would you choose ?
do they aim for the head or for the heart ?
the heart , i guess .
i would not . . . the brain would know that is going on . your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood , blood pouring into the chest cavity . savage pain , marian .
no , it is nothing . . . i am all right .
because if anybody s giving you trouble , pete , i can take care of the problem . . . like that .

at your house . do not you remember ?
no . no , i do not .
we just killed a couple of people . . .
what ?
great question ! ! in the east . . . the far east . . . when a person is sentenced to death . . . they are sent to a place where they cannot escape . . . never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head . . . it could be days . . . weeks . . . or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced . . . this uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation , do not you think ? it is been a pleasure talking to you .
yeah ? . . .
yeah .

oh , read it !
leaving today for london with conway aboard s . s . manchuria . conway can tell nothing of his experiences . is suffering from complete loss of memory . signed , gainsford .
yes . might as well all of it .
yes , sir .
i will dispatch a convoy to meet him .
let me have it . aboard the s . s . manchuria . last night conway seemed to recover his memory . kept talking about shangri la , telling a fantastic story about a place in tibet . insisted upon returning there at once . locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at singapore . am leaving ship myself to overtake him , as fearful of his condition . wrote down details of conway s story about shangri la which i am forwarding . lord gainsford .
she is remaining in her room . she is not feeling very well . now please go on without me . i eat very little .
thank you .
it is always been a source of deep regret , but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible .
yes . those are our own people . they never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning . it is much too hazardous .
yes .
fossils .
fossils , huh ?
i am a paleontologist .
a what ?
a paleontologist .
oh , i see .
well , what do you know about that !
found in asia !
uh huh .
when i get home i shall probably be knighted for it .
knighted ! you do not say . do you mind if i take a look at it ?
not at all .
this is the only thing i was able to save when those heathens surrounded me .
uh huh .
you see , from this vertebrae i shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton .
wait a minute , you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone ?
it was the vertebrae of a megatherium found in asia .
yeah , i remember . you said that before .
sir henry derwent was knighted , and he never got beyond the mesozoic era .
okay , brother .
do not call me brother .
okay , sister . no offense . no offense !
i beg your pardon .
i say , good morning , lovey .
good morning
i see .
i see .
well , it is a good morning , anyway .
i am never conversational before i coffee .
why , of course . yes .
well , it looks to me as if we are traveling west .
that is ridiculous .
is it ?
it certainly is .
look here
any child knows how to tell direction . any child . i do not care where the child is in the air , on the earth , or in the sea . if you face the rising sun , your right hand is the north , and your left hand is the south
i always get it twisted because i am left handed .
oh , really ?
yes .
well , you just reverse it . your left hand is what difference does it make what hand you are ? the north is the north !
uh huh . all i know is the sun rises in the east , and we are going away from it .
now you are irritating and absurd !
of course . that is what i told them last night . you cannot expect a man to sail around in the dark . during this george has been looking around he rises .
do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots ?
all right , all right . keep quiet .
yes !
do you think they are cannibals ?
will you stop squawking !
look at me . look at what they gave me to wear .
you never looked better in your life . as soon as our clothes are cleaned , they are going to give them back to us , lovey .
i just feel as though i am being made ready for the executioner .
that is what they do with cattle just before the slaughter . fatten them .
uh huh . you are a scream , lovey .
please do not call me lovey .
all the conveniences for the condemned , if you ask me .
mr . conway , i do not like this place . i do not like it . it is too mysterious .
i am thinking .
thinking ? what about some double solitaire ?
as a matter of fact , i am very good at double solitaire .
no kidding ?
yes .
then i am your man . come on , toots .
ha , ha who are you to be talking about a mask ? what do you mean ? you have been wearing a mask ever since we met you .
have i ?
it is very strange , you know . you have never told us anything about yourself . who are you , anyway ? why do not you take your mask off for once !
believe me , it is no fun . when you fellas picked me up at baskul , they would been on my tail for a year .
the police ?
uh huh . did you ever hear of chalmers bryant ?
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly you , the swindler of thousands of people
you know , that is what makes the whole thing so funny . a guy like me starts out in life as a plumber an ordinary , everyday , slew footed plumber and by the use of a little brains , mind you , he builds up a gigantic institution , employs thousands of people , becomes a great civic leader . and then the crash comes and overnight he is the biggest crook the country ever had .
you are a thief , sir , and a swindler , and i , for one , will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back .
sounds like a stall to me .
just call me barney .
barney ? why should i ? never ! we have nothing in common . hmmpf , barney ! what effrontery !
okay , lovey .
and this trip to the valley . i cannot imagine why i would allow you to drag me down here . why , we do not know anything about these people . we are not even armed !
they are very nice people except that they have got horns .
horns ?
horns ? what kind of horns ?
so that is where you are . i might of known it . no wonder you could not hear me .
you were asked to have a glass of wine . sit down !
and be poisoned out here in the open ?
certainly not !
this does not obligate me in any way .
i am going to sleep in my bed . come on , lovey !
they were in a quandary , and
come on , lovey .
why ? why come ong all the time ? that is the matter ? are you going to be a fuss budget all your life ? here , drink it up ! are not you having any fun ? where was i ?
in a quandary .
plumbing . everything modern . i am going to run pipes all through the village
nice puss to meet in a dark alley .
wonder that is happened to fenner .
well , there s nothing we can do until the morning .
i will say .
not for me , thanks . no , i am too weary .
please ! please ! do not wait for me ! i eat so very little .
all right , i will ! i will let my hair down ! why not ? it cannot make any real difference now . hey lovey , were you ever chased by the police ?
bryant s utilities that is me .
mr . chang high lamas or low lamas , do we get the porters ?
it is unbelievable .
think of it ! in times like these .
say , what about that gold deal ?
huh ?
gold . you were going to
oh that ! that can wait . nobody s going to run off with it . say , i have got to get busy . i want to show this whole layout to chang . so long . do not you take any wooden nickels .
all right .
no .
say , you are an american , are not you ?
say , listen will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates ? let me alone !
nothing . why ?
why , you look beautiful .
pipes ? where are you going to get pipes ?
oh , that is a cinch . i will show them how to cast pipes out of clay .
sure sure . do not you worry . i will take care of you .
over by that hill .
look , bob !
leaving ?
yes . i have just been talking with the porters . they are going to take us . we have got clothing , food , everything . come on !
when are you going to start ?
right this very minute ! the porters are waiting for us on the plateau . and that chinaman thought he could stop me . come along .
i think i will stick around . i will leave with the porters on their next trip .
you mean you do not want to go ?
well i am
i see . you are afraid of going to jail , eh ?
well , no . you see , i got this plumbing business
all right ! if you insist on being an idiot , i am not going to waste time coaxing you . how about you ?
oh , no you do not want to go yet , honey . she will stick around too . is that right ?
how do you do ?
you have no idea , sir , how unexpected and very welcome you are . my friends and i and the lady in the plane left baskul night before last for shanghai , but we suddenly found ourselves traveling in the opposite direction
he must have had a heart attack , or perhaps the fumes . when the plane landed he was dead .
thank you .
i am glad you like it . it is made right here in the valley .
who and what is shangri la ? you ?
goodness , no !
so there are others ?
oh , yes .
who , for instance ?
in time you will meet them all .
there are some things , my dear conway , i deeply regret i may not discuss .
you know , that is the fourth time you have said that today . you should have a record made of it .
shall we go inside ? i should so like to show you some of our rare treasures .
we follow many .
that is intelligent .
we find , in the valley , it makes for better happiness among the natives . we rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience . as a result , our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy .
how about law and order ? you have no soldiers or police ?
oh , good heavens , no !
how do you deal with incorrigibles ? criminals ?
why , we have no crime here . what makes a criminal ? lack , usually . avariciousness , envy , the desire to possess something owned by another . there can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything .
you have no disputes over women ?
only very rarely . you see , it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted .
suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he did not give a hang if it was good manners or not ?
well , in that event , it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her .
that is very convenient . i think i would like that .
you would be surprised , my dear conway , how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems .
they were .
well , it must have taken
centuries .
centuries ! where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures ?
of course we have no money as you know it . we do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because , well , because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it .
our valley is very rich in a metal called gold , which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world . so we merely . . .
buy and sell ?
buy and sell ? no , no , pardon me , exchange .
i see . gold for ideas . you know mr . chang , there s something so simple and naive about all of this that i suspect there has been a shrewd , guiding intelligence somewhere . whose idea was it ? how did it all start ?
that , my dear conway , is the story of a remarkable man .
who ?
a belgian priest by the name of father perrault , the first european to find this place , and a very great man indeed . he is responsible for everything you see here . he built shangri la , taught our natives , and began our collection of art . in fact , shangri la is father perrault .
when was all this ?
oh , let me see way back in , i think it was , that father perrault stumbled into the valley , half frozen to death . it was typical of the man that , one leg being frozen , and of course there being no doctors here , he amputated the leg himself .
he amputated his own leg ?
yes . oddly enough , later , when he had learned to understand their language , the natives told him he could have saved his leg . it would have healed without amputation .
well , they did not actually mean that .
yes , yes . they were very sincere about it too . you see , a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here . they have never known anything different . so what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here .
well , is it ?
rather astonishingly so , yes . and particularly so in the case of father perrault himself . do you know when he and the natives were finished building shangri la , he was years old and still very active , in spite of only having one leg ?
and still active ?
you are startled ?
oh , no . just a little bowled over , that is all .
forgive me . i should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age . climate , diet , mountain water , you might say . but we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live . in your countries , on the other hand , how often do you hear the expression , he worried himself to death ? or , this thing or that killed him ?
very often .
and very true . your lives are therefore , as a rule , shorter , not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide .
that is all very fine if it works out . a little amazing , of course .
why , mr . conway , you surprise me !
i surprise you ? now that is news .
i mean , your amazement . i could have understood it in any of your companions , but you who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds . or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it ?
mr . chang , if you do not mind , i think i will go on being amazed in moderation , of course .
then everything is quite all right , is not it ?
the only one .
and he can arrange for the porters to take us back ?
the high lama arranges everything , mr . conway .
well , then he is the man i want to see . will you come along ?
shall we have another ?
no thanks . not tonight if you do not mind .
yes , charming .
your brother seems quite fascinated by her .
why not ? she is an attractive young woman .
young ? she arrived here in . she was at the time . she was on her way to join her betrothed when her carriers lost their way in the mountains . the whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people .
amazing ! she still does not look over . when is she likely to grow old in appearance ?
not for years . shangri la will keep her youthful indefinitely .
suppose she should leave it ?
leave shangri la ! that is not likely . you could not drive her out .
no , i mean about her appearance . if she should leave the valley what would happen ?
oh , she would quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age .
it is weird . chang , how old are you ?
age is a limit we impose upon ourselves . you know , each time you westerners celebrate your birthday , you build another fence around your minds .
i cannot let him go alone . it is suicide !
i have offered you some warm broth . i thought perhaps
you get out of here ! if any of you men think you can come busting in here
i do not need any advice from you ! get me a doctor !
i am sorry , but we have no doctors here .
no doctors ? that is fine . that is just fine .
please let me help you .
sure , you can help me ! you can help me jump over that cliff ! i have been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain , but i have not got the nerve to jump !
you should not be looking at the bottom of the mountain . why do not you try looking up at the top sometimes ?
do not preach that cheap , second hand stuff to me ! go on , beat it . beat it !
i am afraid that would not help . you see , we have no porters here .
no porters here ! !
no .
well , we have been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years .
the high lama ! who in blazes is he ? !
yes .
you may not know it , mr . chang , but right here you have utopia .
you have very kind mr . lovett .
i do not mean it in that sense . i only give credit where credit is due . er , mr . chang , i am very anxious to have you realize that i never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story .
oh , i am so glad .
simply preposterous . do you know what i did last night ? last night , mr . chang , i held a sort of a self inventory . i said to myself last night , mr . chang , i said , lovey mr . lovett ! mr . lovett , i said , you are an ungrateful fool . . .
why , no .
ungrateful fool . . . ! those were my very words to myself last night . here are these people in shangri la doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and i have not done one single thing to show my appreciation .
now , what would you like to do ?
well , mr . chang , i thought , with your permission of course , and while i am waiting for these porters , i would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful . geology .
splendid !
is not it ? is not it ! you know i was a professor for twenty years ? and a very good one .
i am sure you were . when would you like to start ?
oh , immediately .
then it is done .
oh , thank you . thank you !
thank you .
pardon me
are you so certain you are away from it ?
as far away as i ever want to be .
oh , dear .
how can we get in touch with them ?
in that respect , you are exceedingly fortunate . we are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now
do not believe him , bob . he is just trying to get out .
now , my dear boy . you should not
you have been lying to us ever since we got here ! apparently it is worked with some people . perhaps it is because they lack the courage to do anything about it . but not me , chang . you are up against the wrong man . i will get out of here , if i have to blow this fantastic place into the valley ! i will get outporters or no porters !
do you mean to tell me you want to leave shangri la ?
i will die if i have to stay here another minute ! i have waited a long time for this chance to go , and you are not going to stop me now . if i have to , i will go alone . it was i who bribed the porters . if it were not for me , you would never get out !
i thought the porters had instructions from the high lama not to take anyone .
the high lama ? who pays any attention to him ? the porters laugh at the high lama . all they want to know is how much gold he will give them . well , i gave them more gold . i have been stealing it for a year . i would do anything to get out of this place . to get away from that high lama the one who calls himself father perrault ! why , he is been insane for years !
father perrault is dead .
he is dead ? that is fine . you will not see me shedding any tears over him ! oh george , you must take me with you !
are not you afraid to leave ? you do not want to look like an old woman , do you ?
old woman ? chang told you that , did not he ?
yes .
i thought so ! he tells everyone i am old . he wants them to stay away from me . he cannot stand it when anyone comes near . he is punished me for every minute i have spent with george . if it were not for him , i would have been out of here long ago , but he always stops me . six months ago , i tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room . i nearly went crazy . look at me , mr . conway , do i look like an old woman ? is this the skin of an old woman ? look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman ?
no , mr . conway , i am not lying . what reason could i have for lying ? the chances are that we will never come out of that horrible trip alive , but i would rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive , than to stay here one more minute now .
yes , of course . certainly . come on !
hey !
are you the high lama ?
yes .
personally , i have enjoyed your community very much . but my friends do not care for this mystery . they are determined to leave as soon as
what is it , my son ?
you are the man chang told me about ! you are the first who two hundred years ago you are still alive , father perrault !
sit down , my son . you may not know it , but i have been an admirer of yours for a great many years .
that i be brought here ? who had that brilliant idea ?
sondra bizet .
oh , the girl at the piano ?
yes . she has read your books and has a profound admiration for you , as have we all .
of course i have suspected that our being here is no accident . furthermore , i have a feeling that we are never supposed to leave . but that , for the moment , does not concern me greatly . i will meet that when it comes . what particularly interests me at present is , why was i brought here ? what possible use can i be to an already thriving community ?
we need men like you here , to be sure that our community will continue to thrive . in return for which , shangri la has much to give you . you are still , by the world s standards , a youngish man . yet in the normal course of existence , you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity . here , however , in shangri la , by our standards your life has just begun , and may go on and on .
but to be candid , father , a prolonged future does not excite me . it would have to have a point . i have sometimes doubted whether life itself has any . and if that is so , then long life must be even more pointless . no , i would need a much more definite reason for going on and on .
we have reason . it is the entire meaning and purpose of shangri la . it came to me in a vision , long , long , ago . i saw all the nations strengthening , not in wisdom , but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy . i saw their machine power multiply until a single weaponed man might match a whole army . i foresaw a time when man , exulting in the technique of murder , would rage so hotly over the world that every book , every treasure , would be doomed to destruction . this vision was so vivid and so moving that i determined to gather together all the things of beauty and culture that i could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing . look at the world today ! is there anything more pitiful ? what madness there is , what blindness , what unintelligent leadership ! a scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other , propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality . the time must come , my friend , when this orgy will spend itself , when brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword . against that time is why i avoided death and am here , and why you were brought here . for when that day comes , the world must begin to look for a new life . and it is our hope that they may find it here . for here we shall be with their books and their music and a way of life based on one simple rule be kind . when that day comes , it is our hope that the brotherly love of shangri la will spread throughout the world . yes , my son , when the strong have devoured each other , the christian ethic may at last be fulfilled , and the meek shall inherit the earth .
i knew you would understand . that is why i came to you for help .
you must not look to me for help . your brother is no longer my problem . he is now your problem , conway .
mine ?
because , my son , i am placing in your hands the future and destiny of shangri la . for i am going to die .
do you think this will come in my time ?
colonel , wait a minute , they may be here now ! say george , get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here .
yes .
yes .
hello ? colonel ?
come on ! we will burn the hangar . that will make light for them !
right , bob .
come on ! quick ! this way .
aha very good , freshie . very good . you would better put his name on the list and make out a report later .
you ?
just this once , bob . i feel like celebrating . just think of it , bob a cruiser sent to shanghai just to take you back to england . you know what it means . here you are . do not bother about those cables now . i want you to drink with me . gentlemen , i give you robert conway england s new foreign secretary .
how i am going to bask in reflected glory ! people are going to point to me and say , there goes george conway brother of the foreign secretary .
do not talk nonsense . give me the bottle .
yes , bob .
did you say we saved ninety white people ?
yes .
hurray for us . did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated ? no , you would not say that . they do not count .
you would better try to get some sleep , bob .
just you wait until i am foreign secretary . cannot you just see me , freshie , with all those other shrewd , little foreign secretaries ? you see , the trick is to see who can out talk the other . everybody wants something for nothing , and if you cannot get it with smooth talk , you send an army in . i am going to fool them , freshie . i am not going to have an army . i am going to disband mine . i am going to sink my battleships i am going to destroy every piece of warcraft . then when the enemy approaches we will say , come in , gentlemen what can we do for you ? so then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think . and what will they think , freshie ? they will think to themselves something s wrong here . we have been duped . this is not according to form . these people seem to be quite friendly , and why should we shoot them ? then they will lay down their arms . you see how simple the whole thing is ? centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants and i will be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum .
do try to sleep , bob .
huh ? oh , sure , freshie . good thing , sleep .
the bloke up there looks a chinese , or a mongolian , or something .
i am going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is .
i do not know . i cannot get the dialect .
it is not knowing that is so awful , bob . not knowing where you are going , or why , or that is waiting when you get there .
it looks like it . smell those fumes ?
dead ?
see that spot ?
yes .
that is where we were this morning . he had it marked . right on the border of tibet . here s where civilization ends . we must be a thousand miles beyond it just a blank on the map .
that is it mean ?
it means we are in unexplored country country nobody ever reached .
thanks . i suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure .
we have had plenty of it the last few days .
it is far from over , from what i can see . this place gives me the creeps , hidden away like this no contact with civilization . bob , you do not seem concerned at all .
oh , i am feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything . i think i am going to like it here .
you talk as though you intend on staying .
something happened to me , when we arrived here , george , that well did you ever go to a totally strange place , and feel certain that you have been there before ?
what are you talking about ?
i do not know .
you are a strange bird . no wonder gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill .
what could there be except just another hill ? in any event , i am not curious . at the moment , it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home . i would give anything to be in london right now .
of course you would . if ever we get out of this place , the thing for you to do is to take that job with helengs father .
what do you mean if we should get out ?
did i say if ?
that is what you said .
well i mean
that is on your mind , bob ? you talk as though we are going to have trouble getting out of here .
george , i have been putting things together . do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot ? and why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane ? chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point . what brought them there ? unless it was to meet us ?
chang s first question was about the pilot .
uh huh .
there must be some connection between the plane and this place . they must have deliberately brought us here . why , bob ? what reason could they have for doing a thing like that ?
that is that is on the other side of the hill .
nothing about the porters yet ?
porters ?
good heavens , bob , we have been here two weeks and we have not found out a thing .
well , we have not been murdered in our beds yet , george , have we ?
i am afraid the porters are just a myth . i guess we never will know why we are here , or how long we are going to be held prisoners .
shhh !
let me go , bob !
chang ! chang ! chang !
all right . sorry , george .
porters ?
did not you find out anything about the porters ?
why i am sorry but i
george . george do you mind ? i am sorry , but i cannot talk about it tonight .
i do not see that there s anything to say .
you cannot leave , george .
why not ? that is going to stop me ?
you must not . you have got to stay here now .
stay here ? ! that is the matter with you , bob ? you have been acting strangely ever since we came here . i have never seen you like this . why cannot we leave ? that is stopping us ?
i do not know what you are talking about . you are carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up . if you will only tell me about it .
i will , george . i want to tell you . i will burst with it if i do not . it is weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable , but so beautiful ! well , as you know , we were kidnapped and brought here . . .
so you think i am mad ?
what else can i think after a tale like that ? good heavens , bob , things like that do not happen today . we are living in the twentieth century .
so you think it is all nonsense , huh ?
i think you have been hypnotized by a lot of loose brained fanatics . why , i would not believe it if i heard it in an english monastery . why should i swallow it here in tibet ? how do you know the things they told you are true ? did they show you any proof ?
i do not need any proof .
i knew there was a reason i hated this place . i would give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they have done to you . how do you know the things they told you are true ? did they show you any proof ? all this talk about the lamas being hundreds of years old . how do you know ? did you see their birth certificates ? i cannot believe it , bob . a bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world . and you , bob conway two feet on the ground conway want to join them . it is horrible .
is that all my story meant to you ?
what else could it mean to me ? it is obviously a lot of bunk .
then you would better go , george . this is no place for you .
it is no place for you , bob . think of that is waiting for you . do you want to stay here until you are half dead ? until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them ?
please , george . i do not want to talk about it anymore .
you have got to talk about it . what about me ? you said they stole that plane to bring you here . i did not want to come . you owe me some responsibility .
i am tired of owing you things . you are free to go . go ahead .
it is that girl that girl has twisted and turned
enough ! never mind the girl ! well , why do not you go ?
oh , george . . .
besides , i i do not feel like making that trip alone , bob .
george , you could not possibly stay here , could you ?
i would go mad !
george , i may be wrong , i may be a maniac . but i believe in this , and i am not going to lose it . you know how much i want to help you , but this is bigger , stronger if you like than brotherly love . i am sorry , george . i am staying .
well , i cannot think of anything more to say . goodbye , bob .
oh yes . it is all set . maria made the arrangements .
maria ?
yes , the little russian girl .
that is she got to do with it ?
she is going with me .
why not ?
because you cannot . do you know what will happen to her if she leaves shangri la ? she is a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved . take her out of this valley and she will fade away like an echo .
what do you mean fade away like an echo ?
she came here in !
you are wrong , george .
i am not wrong . she told me so . besides , she would not have to tell me . i would know anyway . i found out a lot of things last night . i am not ashamed of it either . it is probably one of the few decent things that is ever happened in this hellish place .
i do not believe it ! i do not believe a word of it !
all right . i will prove it to you ! you believe everything they have told you without proof ! i will prove my story !
i do not believe it ! i cannot believe it . she is lying . you are lying . you are lying ! every word you have been saying is a lie ! come on , say it !
yes .
the clothes ?
yes , everything !
what about the others ?
i have already asked them . they are afraid to make the trip . we will have to send an expedition back after them .
come on ! we are wasting time !
what was that ?
was saying
cannot you shut up ? must you go on babbling like an idiot ?
there s nothing that would suit them better than to lose us , but we must go on . come on .
as long as they keep on aiming at us , we are safe . come now , child .
i am alexander p . lovett , sir .
why are not you registered through our office ?
hiding ? oh , no . hunting i was in the interior hunting fossils . this morning i looked up suddenly
i know and a war broke out right over your head .
of course . we never left the air . i know i did not sleep the whole night long .
that fellow got on at baskul .
that is he doing ? where is he taking us ? he may be a maniac for all we know .
what if he refuses ?
we will smash his face in . that is what we will do .
brilliant ! can anyone here fly a plane ?
in for what ?
i do not know . he must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from fenner . when he lands , we will find out .
you mean to tell me you are not going to do anything until we land ?
what do you suggest ?
why , you you look here he may dash us to pieces !
it might afford you a great deal of relief . now gentlemen , i am going back to sleep . oh , and i was having such a peaceful dream . as soon as he lands , let me know .
where are we going ? huh ?
well , mr . conway , for a man who is supposed to be a leader , your do nothing attitude is very disappointing .
we would be eternally grateful if you
my name s sondra .
hope you will forgive me for
oh , you mean my pigeons .
yes . hold this pigeon .
you suggested my being brought here , did not you ? what gave you the idea i would fit in ?
that was easy . i read your books .
oh , you have read my books . you do more things ! what have my books got to do with it ?
i saw a man whose life was empty .
a man whose life was empty !
oh , i know . it was full of this and full of that . but you were accomplishing nothing . you were going nowhere , and you knew it .
a little boy whistling in the dark ! ? do you realize that there is a british cruiser waiting at shanghai , smoke pouring out of its funnels , tugging at its moorings , waiting to take mr . conway back to london ? do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that conway is missing ? does that look like a man whose life is empty ?
yes .
you are absolutely right . and i had to come all the way to a pigeon house in shangri la to find the only other person in the world who knew it . may i congratulate you ?
do not worry about the pigeons . from now on , you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet !
i will help you . to begin with , you would like to know what i am doing here . whether i was born here .
thank you .
well , i was almost born here . it took place in that wild country beyond the pass . my father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year . when chang found us , only father and i were alive . but he was too weak to climb the pass . he died on the way . i was brought up here by father perrault himself .
father perrault ! i envy you . i talked to him last night .
yes , i know .
father perrault . of course i cannot quite get used to this age thing .
oh , you are going to make life very simple .
all of it . father perrault and his magnificent history . this place , hidden away from the rest of the world , with its glorious concepts , and now you come along and confuse me entirely .
i am sorry . i thought i was to be the light . but why do i confuse you ? am i so strange ?
on the contrary , you are not strange . and that in itself is confusing . i have the same idea about shangri la . the sense that i have been here before , that i belong here .
i am so glad .
i cannot quite explain it , but everything is somehow familiar . the very air that i breathe . the lamasery , with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley , while its head explores the eternal . all the beautiful things i see , these cherry blossoms , you all somehow familiar . i have been kidnapped and brought here against my will . a crime , a great crime , yet i accept it amiably , with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend . why ? can you tell me why ?
perhaps because you have always been a part of shangri la without knowing it .
i wonder .
i am sure of it . just as i am sure there s a wish for shangri la in everyone s heart . i have never seen the outside world . but i understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy . yet i just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security , where there s beauty and comfort , where they would not have to be mean and greedy . oh , i just wish the whole world might come to this valley .
then it would not be a garden spot for long .
bump ?
when the plane lands at shangri la and wakes us all up .
you see , it is not a dream .
you know , sometimes i think that it is the other that is the dream . the outside world . have you never wanted to go there ?
goodness , no . from what you tell me about it , it certainly does not sound very attractive .
it is not so bad , really . some phases are a little sordid , of course . that is only to be expected .
why ?
oh , the usual reasons . a world full of people struggling for existence .
struggling , why ?
well , everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself , accumulate a nest egg , and so on .
why ?
you know , if you keep on asking that , we are not going to get anywhere . and do not ask me why .
i was just going to .
it is the most annoying word in the english language . did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it ? mother s little darling mus not stick her fingers in the salad bowl . why ? because it is not lady like to do that . why ? because that is what forks are made for , darling .
why , mother ?
because mother read it in a book somewhere , and if mother s little darling does not take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant , mother s going to wring her little neck .
i would love it !
why ?
forgiven . you know , when we were on that plane , i was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it . that silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys , covering ten times the distance of the plane . it was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed . and i have been thinking that somehow you are that plane , and i am that silly shadow . that all my life i have been rushing up and down hills , leaping rivers , crashing over obstacles , never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms .
how could i know that a war was going to break out right over my head ! right over my head . oh , my word ! i tell you , those chinese were pouncing on me from every direction . i had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape .
i tell you , we are going west , and shanghai is east of here !
be quiet ! fenner s the best pilot in china . he knows what he is doing .
it is fenner .
i do not know . i am a paleontologist , not a foreign secretary .
mountain grass . it is good , too . here , have some . i have read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff .
english !
the first thing we want to do is to cable the foreign office . all of england is waiting to hear about my brother . there s a cruiser at shanghai ready to take him back .
we did not get much information out of him , did we bob ?
go ? where ?
home . away from here . i have got porters to take us back .
oh , my dear boy , i am sorry . that is impossible . why , i have my classes all started .
i do not care what you have got started . do you want to go ?
well no i think i would better wait . yes , yes . i will . i will wait .
you will wait till you rot !
yes . barney !
please do not go .
i am sorry . i have not even got any cigarettes left !
i will make some for you ! you will come today ?
perhaps .
please say you will . the days are so very long and lonely without you . please . . .
all right , i will be there .
thank you .
you will tell me some of the things i want to know , will not you ? you will tell me who runs this place . and why we were kidnapped . and what they are going to do with us !
hesitated , sir .
i am not talking about that . i am talking about your choice of targets .
uh . . . yes . apparently i did , air .
the hell were you thinking ?
well , i dunno . i mean , when you looked at all the other options . . . it just seemed sorta obvious .
obvious ? why do not you and i have a little talk about the obvious . . . outside .
cowan
wait . uh sir . please . anyway . hook head guy . i am thinking how can he think with a hook for a head ? answer that is not his head . then i think
cowan
of course not , cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road , cause , if you looked at it , the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually one guy and
cowan will you shut your god damed mouth ?
it means i know you think you got a beat on things . but trust me , you do not . you do not even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to that is really going on in the world . and if you want to find out even a little , you will shut up and come with me . and if you do not , fine . go with them . cause i am not interested in breaking in another little hot shot only to have him wig or die on me just when i am starting to count on him . so forgive me if you do not exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard , but this is not the love boat . and i am not captain fucking stubing . now i am sorry . but this has been one long , bad day .
it is not even a fucking door .
what the hell . . .
kids game a couple galaxies over .
i guess i lost
you got smeared .
and goodwill toward man ?
no . just peace on earth .
i gotta be honest about something .
oh , you will still , be guarding him .
and if i say yes ?
lose your name and identity , work endless hours an behalf people who do not know you exist , and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe .
your supervisors have no idea why you are here .
they do not ?
they do not . now , son . if you get the job , you are going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways . here s a little piece of advice do not use this so much .
i . . . i do not know , air . this guy . mr . best of the best of the best . . . i do not know . it is just still find it a little . . . humorous . i am sorry . sir .
for instance . . . it says here you lost your parents at , and , since then . . .
sir . i thought those records were sealed .
we are the government , cowan .
no it makes sense . cause i gotta tell ya , when i was in third grade they told me i was crazy cause i swore that our teacher was from , like , venus or something .
mrs . edelson ?
what happens if i say no ?
yes , sir .
yes , air ? ooomph .
sorta literally gets ahead of himself .
hang on . and this is the good part when you are fully ordained , he will come when you call him , too . dave .
his physics are a little different than ours . do not worry
it will make sense later ?
no . but you will get used to it . welcome to the men in black .
further . . . what are you talking about , air ? that makes no sense i hold three cadet class records
actually , it did not come from me .
well this did not .
then where did it ? sir . forgive me , but it makes no sense . worked my ass off to grad
actually , sir
cowan . do you ever think that maybe , just maybe , other people might be right and you might be wrong ?
all the time , sir .
you do ?
yes , air . but i am usually wrong . sir .
i would go with number three .
three , huh ? really ? cause a cup of coffee says we are talking about . . . number . . . four ? huh ? no ?
oh . shit . it is in the car
what ? i thought you just
kay , i am sorry . . .
do not worry about it . four eyes will run a track on him . we will get that son of a . . . whatever the hell he is the son of .
do not worry about it . it is been a long night . speaking of which you owe me a cup of coffee , remember ?
oh yeah ? the hell you were not . little pither just out of school . . .
listen do me a favor do not mention the thing
do not worry about it .
yup . sure is .
dee , you have been useful for years . we are clueless , you are tired . why do not you go home and get some rest .
home ? you gotta be kidding me . black ?
kay . . .
what ? who the hell are you ?
ins , washington . special services .
sir
pasen al furgon v larguense de aqui ! take the van and go .
sir , you cannot just
do not sir me you have no idea who you are dealing with .
why ? what are you gonna do ?
actually that is a very good question . the answer if you will just look at this part is here .
what ?
you heard me . you two , especially .
we wear black .
oh . right . i guess that is kind of cool , too , in it is own way . course , this is not really black it is kind of a dull , dirty , tarry sort of noncolor , is not it ?
i understand . hey , it works for the hasids , right ? no one recognizes them .
right .
but not a bug bug it is an insect .
so that is the problem ?
well , first of all . . . i gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a ferrari testerrosa . i mean , there is a lot of em on the street these days , and . . . uh . . .
it is the way we do it . the way we have always done it .
i know , but we are on a college campus . . .
this is a college ? i am sorry , i thought it was a carnival .
keep her out of here while i check it out .
i am , uh . . . real curious about your met up here . i see you have the , uh , double office type thing going here . .
she did not even know you . .
i know , that is usually the only time i actually have a shot . and what if i wanted to see her again ? i would have to completely re introduce myself .
such a shame , too . cause you made such a good impression the first time .
hey , i was working her . i was working my thing .
just so i understand . . . you are thing is . . . acting like an idiot ? or is it actually being an idiot ? besides
i know , i know . i read the manual . no attachments . we work alone . blah . blah .
if you do not have anyone to tell , you will not tell anyone . believe me , you get used to it .
i think you are too used to it . if you ask me , you have been doing this job too long .
you do not know the half of it .
what would you do before this , anyway ? wait let me guess . ice sculpture ? rock ?
i taught kindergarten .
ha ha . no , really .
it was a long time ago .
why ?
why ? well , it would not hurt you to have a little more fun . i know i do not know you all that well , but
you do not know me at all .
um kay ?
let s see . . . that was second gear . . kay shifts into third . jay winces .
something seem unusual to you about that ?
uh . . . you mean . . . a family of sixeyed , red faced space creatures travelling to new mexico to have dinner with their cousins , the invertebrates ? seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me .
if it was just a meal , why did they have so much luggage ?
i dunno . maybe it was baby supplies , kay starts the car , starts to pull a u turn .
let s check am out .
it is an edna named after zed s ex wife . all you do is at the target . the scope matches the image with the image on your retina . the barrel will find the target on its own .
i guess it is simple , huh ? they are either gone . . . or dead .
or someone has a nitrogenizer .
a what ?
history s proven that where there s a nitrogenizer , there s a legged signazoid . they use it to make our food digestible for their systems .
then would not we also know if he is here ?
hold it .
there s gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown philadelphia . i take it there s a reason we are going to this one .
there s a god damn good reason .
gee . you really think ?
jeebs is eager to have me deport him . but would rather kill himself than go downtown . why ?
i dunno . why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner ? .
why did mikey leave nazca ?
and that is this . . . ?
what ?
where to ?
i do not want to rattle you , but dee was here for the war of the worlds .
the radio show ?
no . the aliens organized , all of them , and tried a coup . they made it seem like a radio show afterwards .
you think that is that is happening ?
i think that is that is happening . . .
that is the loch ness monster . and . . . kay that is . . . eyes ?
get back in the car !
we are rising .
the pentagon .
i dunno , man . maybe we should .
what if he is telling the truth ?
you know something ? i actually never think of that . i gotta get some coffee .
hang on . there s gotta be something on this guy . did you contact the alliance ? do they have anything ?
yes . well , in his own mind , yeah . what if , from his point of view , he is ?
how does that help me ?
well . . . if you think about it , then it would mean that maybe everything he is saying is true .
kay . all i am saying
i know what you are saying . and i am telling you i do not trust him
i know you do not trust him . you do not trust anybody
cause i have been doing this thirty years and if i do not know when something does not feel right by now
that is my point . for thirty years you have been looking through things and under things and behind things . well what i am saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things . he said our enemy in already here . well maybe it is . maybe our enemy is , literally , already here .
everything left the planet , right ? except one thing . that little insect the one we found in sudbury . did it leave when everything else left ?
since as long as we have been keeping records . . .
for how long ?
well , if the bugs have hatched , and they are not here . . . then where are they ?
all of it ?
i would double it and add .
do his job .
right . oh , and here .
actually , it is a shotgun . hold onto it
in case i need it ?
in case i need it .
kay ! ?
getting eaten ! ? that was your plan ! ?
and i almost got digested . it goes with the job .
you coulda told me what you were doing .
there was not time , sport !
not her . me . they are beautiful , are not they ? the stars . i never just look anymore and they are beautiful .
kay , you are scaring your partner .
i have not been training a partner i have been training a replacement .
oh no , i cannot do this job by myself .
or that is no horrible down here that everyone s trying to avoid it ?
why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet . . . is having then leave the planet ?
you know , there s something we never really thought of . . .
me , too . i feel a long day coming on .
kay . seriously . what if he actually means what he says ?
actually , they disgust me . but that is what i love about them . like a car wrack , you know , how you should not look , but you always pull over and watch real close , or even pretend you are a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures ?
i would prefer if you were just a little more blunt .
oh , yeah , well , you know . i am a big fan . i have read all your work .
yeah , right . even i can barely read all my work .
with exclusionary frecto inhibitors ?
exactly . i very much enjoy that .
do have any idea what i just said ?
actually , you may have .
i guess you could say we are entopologists of a sort .
i do not think so . i mean , him , he could be a scientist , maybe . but you . . . exterminator , i would understand . but entopolgist ? no way .
why not ?
well , first of all , it is entomologist .
what is it ?
it is the most amazing insect nest i have ever seen . and i will tell you one thing , it sure as hell ai not the andean mollatoosa .
but it is definitely a nest , is not it ?
man , hey maybe you are an entopologist after all .
it would have had to have been recently within a few weeks .
so . . . how did they get here ?
what do we do ? lean into it .
what the hell does that mean ?
actually . . . i do not know .
out of focus ?
the only thing i could think of would be . . . you would have to get rid of the queen .
what if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is ?
are you sure you do not ?
they respond to fear , right ?
yeah . . . ?
well i am going to give them something to be afraid of .
no .
maybe you need a closer look .
you figured what ?
i figured it did not matter . it is my last day of business . i was wrong . i am sorry . hey , look what i got for you a free floating plasma pad ? one of the good ones , too , with zoids .
i understand . i understand , thank you . how about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser ?
yes . yes , that is eminently fair of you .
and i am bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me
you are not taking me in !
how could it not ?
why do not you ask the mosebacke ? brazil . until years ago they ate with their hands , lived in huts , and did not even know the rest of the world existed . years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork . today , they do not exist .
come on now . people are smart .
no a person is smart . people are dumb . and the more people you put together , the dumber they get . and you know that .
give or take . it was right around your civil war , i think , when i was here last . we were waiting till your planet was warm enough .
most entirely . earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which , in order for the planet to survive , must be exterminated .
nowhere , huh ? odd you would get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere .
i do not believe you , mikey . and you know why i do not believe you ? cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon .
yeah , wall , you know , i was just going there . . . to pick then up .
i dunno . one ?
try seven . from unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident . you wanna tell me that is going on ? huh ?
it is . . . coming .
what are you talking about , it is coming ? that is coming ?
we have got about eight or nine prospects i want you look
yeah , i will talk to you .
nothing .
nothing at all ? now ? last month ? anything in the last few years ?
nope . nothing at all .
yeah , kay ?
did our friend announce when he is making his speech ?
noon exactly .
did he say where ?
actually , yeah
would not happen to be the lincoln memorial , would it ?
how would you know that ? kay ?
cause i think we are looking at it .
they are not my pals
they are not even gonna be your enemie a if you do not give that to me really soon .
what if i do not ?
in about seconds they are gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute .
will it lower the curve ?
i do not think it is a tradeoff you really want to make . now give it to me i can reverse the effects if you give it to me now .
i wanna make a deal .
tell us the truth . you do not just find these things , at least not in this neighborhood .
i promised i would not tell .
this guy . where was he ?
scientific american ? really ?
yeah . nov i know it looks normal , but watch this .
may i have a look ?
come again ?
but , unfortunately , you are even less attracted to guys you have never seen before .
the what ?
seriously . i am not going any further until you tell who you are .
wait listen
fine . good .
so whattya say , kid ? you in or out ?
highway , just west of smith . why ?
i need you in philadelphia . i got a code , in a high school .
what the hell is going on ?
what about the other agents ? ella ? tee ?
elle s up in portland three of her charges left visibly at a trailblazers game . shots got a lot to mop up . tee says his shanghai quadrasectionals have not been around since morning .
jesus , everyone s moving . could be an assembly . does it look aggressive ?
hard to tell . i hope not .
keep an eye on things there . we will see what we can find out at ernie goosels .
dee ? what are you doing here ?
what do we have ? are we showing anything ?
they went right to the president .
they went to the president ? directly ? they went over our heads ?
where is he making his big speech ?
they have not announced it yet . all i know is we are in motion for the most watched media event in history .
did it leave ?
actually , i do not know . . .
oh shit !
i got a planet check on that bug . it is from way the hell out in the third belt . it is organic , formed in the same blast that made our solar system .
do not tell me . insects .
just a guess . but i think found a nest .
well , uh . . . so we can got into things , i guess .
that is why you have doors , mr . president . keys , however , are to lock the doors . and locks , as you know , are to keep people out . why ? fear . you humans are afraid . so you set up boundaries . borders . your car . your home . your country . all the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you . well i am here to let that enemy go . because there s a border you did not even know existed . it is the border to the universe . and unlike your other borders , you humans did not set this border up to keep other planets from you . it was set up by others , to keep you away from them . until now . because i have been sent here to open the door . to present you , so to speak , with the key to the universe .
if i may , sir . . . what exactly are you offering ?
a good question . and a simple answer . no more hunger . no more smog . no more overpopulation . no more war .
and i assume you are bringing this to us because we are the most powerful country on the planet . . .
that and , well . . . i want my friends to see me on cnn . okay , i will admit it ours is an illegal hookup . we will gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it .
can you see ?
is it now ?
what ?
is it now ?
they are inside .
who ?
agatha . . .
can you see the balloon man ?
what ?
forget that guy
do it . right here . on the ground .
he will turn around .
he will not .
wait .
anderton , leave .
please
i have to find out what happened to my life . agatha . i am not going to kill the man . i do not even know him .
what is it ?
anderton
you were right . i am not being set up .
i cannot leave . you said so yourself , there is no minority report . i do not have an alternative future .
but you still have a choice . the others never had a chance to see their future . you did .
someplace safe .
i have to go back .
why ?
the other two will die without me .
you want to spend the rest of your life in the temple ?
agatha , you are never going back there .
i am going back . i see myself there .
who wanted her little girl back ?
the drowning woman . anne . . . but it was too late . her little girl was already gone .
she died ?
she grew up .
she is still alive ?
oh , jesus . . .
what
run !
then who was he ?
just some guy . . . they found .
found ? where ?
somewhere .
because i found out about her . . .
about who ?
anne lively . . .
i know . . . i do , too . . .
how did i not see this ? agatha , who killed you mother ? who killed anne lively ?
that is comforting .
you do understand i cannot just give you new irises . the scanners will read the scar tissue . alarms will go off . large men with guns will appear . . .
right . i know
yeah
and replace them with new ones .
i know that , but i wanna keep the old ones .
why ?
because my mother gave them to me . what do you care ? they are no good to you on the secondary market anyway .
whatever you say , john .
it is all i could safely move .
tell you what , since you and i go way back , i will give you my old pal discount . how is that sound ?
we know each other ?
oh , yes .
baltimore . eastside . solomon p . eddie m . d . i was a plastic surgeon .
yes , you did .
you made those tapes . . .
they were performance pieces .
you set your patients on fire !
and put them out . some not as quickly as others , but let s change the subject , shall we ? the future is much more interesting than the past . do not you think ?
how can i do what i do now ? let s just say i spent a lot of time in the prison library .
how do i find the
here
i cannot even stand up
i know you are in a hurry , so i juiced up the nano reconstruction around your new eyes .
the nano . . . what ?
organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels . it will feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs . but whatever you do , do not scratch .
go blind . i know .
yes , sir . i am gideon . the music relaxes the prisoners .
no , you are not in trouble . i am interested in a murder .
kill type ?
drowning .
this about the justice department ? they laid on a tour for tomorrow a . m . told me to wear a tie . you like this one ?
this is the official composite of the three precogs ?
that is right . it is a combined data stream based on all three previsions .
show me just agatha s data stream .
for that , we have to go for a ride .
i work graveyard , swing and day all by my lonesome .
. . . graveyard shift .
not to mention , saved by the bell .
on account of those are not his eyes . he had em swapped out to fool the scanners .
try again .
no . . . we have the two previsions from the twins right here , but . . . . . . i cannot pull up any data from the female . probably just a glitch .
just tell me about the intended victim . this anne lively . . .
so she cleaned up . where is she now ?
lara
it is actually kind of a rush . they say you get visions that your life flashes before your eyes . that all your dreams come true .
do not worry , lamar .
the nation votes this week . . .
uh huh . . .
has the observer from justice shown up yet ?
hang on , lamar
lamar , i am sorry . i do not know what
do not apologize , john .
i understand . sir .
yes , sir .
you can let him look around , answer his questions , but watch him . if there s any problems , make sure we know about it first .
i understand . that is the other thing ?
tuck in your shirt .
i am saying the third prevision was not there . and that is not all . i spent a few hours down there and it turns out there s a dozen more cases with missing previsions .
so give him a tour . he does not know enough to ask the right questions .
if he is looking for a flaw in the system
he is not . he is looking for a flaw in us , john .
what ?
she is worried about you . and , quite frankly , so am i .
i am fine .
i hear you have been spending a lot of time in the sprawl .
i go running down there .
in the middle of the night ?
i am fine , lamar .
we will not let them .
no ? how is an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them ?
justice already knows . talk to me , john . tell me that is happening ?
this is all witwer . he is setting me up .
stop . just wait . who s the victim ?
somebody named leo crow .
and who the hell is that ?
i have no idea . i have never heard of him . but i am supposed to kill him in less than thirty six hours .
all right , john , just take a breath , let s think about this . . .
i am out of breath ! i am a fucking fugitive !
then come to my house . we will talk
i cannot . they are following me right now . they will meet me there . they will halo me .
how could witwer have accessed the case file ?
can you fake the cerebral output ?
we are years from that . john , i am asking you please , come in , we will shut down the system until we get this thing figured out .
you know i cannot do that . you cannot do that . . . lamar , i need you to talk to wally , see if witwer s gone inside the temple again . then ask jad for any off hour eyedents into the analytical room
john . just tell me , who s leo crow ?
i am not getting halo would .
you cannot run
everybody runs .
i just wanted to congratulate you . you did it . you have created a world without murder . so what if you had to kill someone to do it .
beauty ? the precogs do not even always agree with each other !
no doubt .
then go ahead , pull the trigger .
armor up sick sticks and concussion guns this is gonna be close .
you are kidding , that is today ?
i wrote it down in your calendar , then left a message at your house
all i need , some twink from the fed poking around right now . check again with the paper , they had it forwarded . see if the neighbors know where they went , check all relations
uh , sir . . .
get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside .
the brick has been repointed , the glass is original with new glazing bars . i show composite mouldings with dentils . someone took care in the renovation . let s find the architect . . .
victims are pronounced here . killers here . we never touch anything .
i show a cop on horseback .
everybody runs .
you do not have to do this , chief .
you do not have to chase me , fletcher .
red ball double homicide one male , one female . killer s male , white , s .
case , previsualized by the precogs and recorded on holoshpere by precrime s q stacks . my fellow witnesses for case are dr . katherine james and chief justice frank pollard .
run the subscription list . . .
send a dcpd blue white out there , set up a perimeter and tell em we are en route . that is our confirmed time ?
from solar position , trig image confirms it at approximately eight oh four a . m .
no maglev system .
the mall ?
georgetown .
yeah ? so ?
now look at him . . .
did he close the front door ?
what ?
did marks close the front door ? !
come on , chief , you think about it , the way we work changing destiny and all we are more like clergy than cops .
uh huh . jad ?
sir ?
go back to work . all of you .
we are in motion on something .
nope . somebody s thinking about this one .
amazing there s someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that .
start a location run and a contact search for future victim leo crow . and , jad , i will need a last known sheet when you get it .
i have got no address last known or otherwise no tax returns for the last five years .
check ncic , maybe he is got a record . then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location .
that was easy .
any id on the shooter yet ?
still scrubbing . . . looks like there s a third party , somebody wearing shades just out the window . . .
sure , chief . i think i will grab one for myself while i am at it . . .
take your time .
your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office . . .
they did . make yourself comfortable . we will be back in an hour .
you mind if i tag along ?
yes , it is .
because it was going to fall .
you are certain ?
yes .
but it did not fall . you caught it .
you ever get any false positives ? someone intends to kill his boss or his wife , but they never go through with it . how do the precogs tell the difference ?
the precogs do not see what you intend to do , only what you will do .
then why cannot they see rapes , or assaults . . . or suicides ?
speaking of interfacing , i would love to say hello .
to hineman ?
cops are not allowed inside the temple .
really ? you have never been inside ?
we keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering .
so i will be the first one to go in then ?
maybe you did not hear me .
if it is a question of authority .
there s no question . you do not have any .
i have a warrant in my pocket that says different .
the precogs are pattern recognition filters , nothing more .
but you call this room the temple .
just a nickname .
the oracle is not where the power is anyway . the power s always been with the priests . even if they had to invent the oracle .
what does he think of your chosen line of work ?
i do not know . he was shot and killed when i was fourteen on the steps of his church in bethesda .
why do not you cut the cute act , danny , and tell me exactly what it is you are looking for ?
flaws .
there has not been a murder in six years . there s nothing wrong with the system . it is perfect .
i agree . the system is perfect . if there s a flaw , it is human . it always is . thank you for the tour , wally .
i will write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night .
you gonna tell on me ?
possession alone will cost you six months , not to mention your badge .
wally . this is danny witwer . he is from justice and we are to give him a full run of the farm .
it helps if you do not think of them as human .
nothing . . . she grabbed me , and then there was an image on the screen . . .
she grabbed you ? impossible . the precogs are not even aware of us . in the milk all they see is the future .
it could have been a nightmare . . . sometimes they dream about the old murders .
to you ? i do not think so . . . what would she say ?
she said . . .
do i know you ? who are you ?
oh . . . hi , john .
there s no way of knowing for sure . she could have forgotten whatever it is you are looking for . . .
okay . fine . where the hell is that ?
i need your help .
well , hey , you did not have to come all the way down here . for you , chief , i make housecalls . . .
i need help with her .
well , hello there , honey pie .
rufus . she is a precog .
she is a precog ?
that is right .
rufus , for christ s sake , get up .
i am sorry for whatever i am gonna do ! and i swear , i did not do any of the stuff i did !
no . no way . i would not even know where to begin ! those thoughts about my cousin elena they were just thoughts . i would never
c mon , rufus , you have been busted twice for felony hacking .
so ?
so now i need you to hack into her .
they do not belong to anybody .
then take her to radio shack .
tell me how .
i guess that is all of it .
uh , i will try . . .
that is great .
what a big boy . how old are you ?
i love you , too ! i love you daddy . love ya , dad .
are you kidding ? there s absolutely positively no way , on my best day , i could ever beat twelve seconds !
come on !
all right , i will try . . .
you gotta have faith , dad .
it is a little late for that .
wanna hear something funny ?
what the hell .
i lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father . he took me all over the world .
no . he got tired of pretending .
oh , sean
the funny thing is , i started to believe he really was my dad .
sean
i feel bad about that . i need you to forgive me .
i forgive you .
once i even told him i loved him .
i forgive you . . .
the more you want to believe something , the easier it is to be fooled .
i was looking for you . . .
i know that . i know you would have done anything to find me . i know you would have died for me .
i wanted to .
good bye , dad . . .
i am your son . i am you .
sean , wait . . .
hold your breath , dad . . .
did i ? i do not recall . . . i got lots of kids from that place
some somebody s father ?
his name was sean . six years ago . francis pool .
he is alive ?
i put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay .
no !
no .
the precogs were wrong .
if you do not kill me , my family gets nothing !
who said i would ?
crow . i am not gonna kill you .
look , believe me , i know it is hard , but you gotta do it
i am asking you again , who made you do this ?
i do not know i never saw his face . all i know is , the next day i was out , so the guy must have had juice somewhere . look , man , you gotta go through with this .
what the fuck is going on ?
fake . he gave it to me . now shoot me , goddammit , before i lose my nerve !
tell me , who was it , set this up ?
if i tell you , my family gets nothing .
who made you do this ?
kill me !
tell me !
you are not gonna kill me . . .
good bye , crow .
i am a little dizzy . . .
the what ?
the vine the baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall . . .
i am . . . not . . . a . . . killer .
you can tell me how someone . . . could fake a prevision .
and how would i know that ?
if the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention , then yes , i invented precrime .
you do not seem all that proud .
i am not . i was trying to heal them , not turn them into . . . something else .
heal who ?
the innocents we now use to stop the guilty .
you are talking about the precogs . . .
you think the three in the tank come from a test tube ? they are merely the ones who survived .
and how did lamar become involved ?
back then , he was still a da , and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom . you have to understand , these people were the dregs of society . but once they saw their children . . . he decided he would do whatever he could for them . he is that way , you know , paternal about certain things . precrime . the precogs . you .
you say some of the children died ?
so many of them . . . despite what we did for them . or maybe because of what we did to them . it does not matter . it is a perfect system now , is not it ?
i am not a murderer . i have never even met the man i am supposed to kill .
and , yet , a chain of events has started . a chain that will lead inexorably to his death .
not if i stay away from him .
how can you avoid a man you have never met ?
so you will not help me ?
i cannot help you . no one can . the precogs are never wrong .
most of the time , all three precognitives will see an event in the same way . but once in a while , one of them will see things differently than the other two .
jesus christ why did not i know about this ?
because these minority reports are destroyed the instant they occur .
why ?
obviously , for precrime to function , there cannot be any suggestion of fallibility . after all , what good is a justice system that instills doubt ? it may be reasonable , but it is still doubt .
i am saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might , just might , have an alternate future .
does burgess know about this ? about the minority report ?
i used to joke with lamar that we were the mother and father of precrime . well , in my experience , parents often see their children as they want them to be , not as they are .
answer my question . did lamar burgess know about the minority report ?
yes , of course , he knew , but at the time , he felt we both felt their existence was . . . an insignificant variable .
insignificant to you maybe , but what about those people i put away with alternate futures ? my god , if the country knew there was a chance they might not
the system would collapse .
i believe in that system . . .
do you ? really ?
but you will bring it down if you kill leo crow . why , that will be the most spectacular public display of how precrime . . . did not work .
i am not gonna kill anybody .
hold that thought .
why should i trust you ?
you should not . you should not trust anyone . . . certainly not the attorney general who wants it all for himself . not the young federal agent who wants your job . not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he is created . do not trust anyone . just find the minority report .
you said they are destroyed .
i said the record is destroyed . the original report exists for all time . i designed the system so that whenever a report occurred , it would be stored in a safe place but not declared .
what safe place is that ?
the safest place of all .
inside the precog who predicted it . all you have to do is download it .
that is all , huh ? just walk right into precrime , go into the temple , somehow tap into the precogs , and then download this minority report . . .
if . . . you have one .
and then walk out .
actually , i think you will have to run out , but yes , that is what you have to do .
you are insane or you think i am .
sometimes in order to see the light , you have to risk the dark .
it is always in the more gifted of the three .
which one is that ?
the female .
he is dead , lara .
oh , god , what did you do ?
nothing . i did not kill him .
then how did he
lara , i do not know why this is happening . i just know they are setting me up . i cannot trust anybody . i do not know who to talk to or where to go . . . lara ? are you there ?
no , it is not , lamar . there was nothing anyone could do .
you look great .
i thought you were retiring ?
i was , but this whole incident with john made me realize the fragility of what we have built here . this is johngs legacy as much as mine and i want to protect that .
anne lively . john was talking about her right before they took him .
i do not know who that is .
we know why john was tagged .
he also said crow was a fake .
sean
no . that is what everyone thinks . john shot a man dead in baltimore six months before .
no . i do not think you do . the other day , when he came to the cottage , he talked about a lot of things , but danny witwer , the man he was supposed to have just killed ? he did not mention him . he did not say his name even once .
lamar
all right . tell you what i will do . first thing monday , i will look over the witwer evidence and i will have gideon run the containment files , see if anyone drowned a woman named what did you say her name was ?
anne lively . . . but i never said she drowned .
tell him not now .
he just wanted a few minutes before
not . now .
i will be right there .
my god . . .
i padded your expense account for the last six months .
thank you . this is burgess .
the mets . john does not think they have got a deep enough pitching roster this year , and i am inclined to agree .
why are you protecting him ? you knew he was doping , yet you did nothing about it .
the man lost a child , for christ s sake . . .
six years ago . what did you two talk about yesterday afternoon ?
none of your damn business .
oh , it is all my damn business now , lamar . investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction . . . so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy . he is my suspect .
he is my subordinate !
i do not want john anderton hurt .
what ?
i do not wanna say over the phone , but i think we may be chasing the wrong man .
where are you ?
wait , just a second . . .
yes . this is from the twins , arthur and dashiel . agatha s stream was missing . now this one is from the cyberparlor . anderton downloaded it directly from agatha . watch . . .
not quite .
i do not understand
this murder is happening at two different times .
i know . he came to me , told me about the missing data stream . he was concerned that you might find it .
i did find it . it was inside of agatha all this time . so the question is , why would someone want this erased from the data file ?
danny , tell me what you are thinking .
i am thinking someone got away with murder .
how ?
yes . . . it is called an echo . the act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the precogs .
precog deja vu . . .
we teach the tech s to identify them and disregard . . .
yes .
shhh . you know what i hear ?
what ?
nothing . no footsteps coming up the stairs . no hovercraft out the window . no clickity click of little spyders . no one crashing through that door . and do you know why i do not hear any of those things , danny ? because right now , the precogs cannot see .
i wanna kill my boss .
uh huh . okay . you got some images i can work with ?
right here .
good . what i can do is set you up down in the
no , i wanna kill my boss !
get the hell outta here . you sick bastard .
nice to meet you . gum ?
not after the vote next week . once the amendment passes , we go national , there s gonna be nowhere to run .
that is the red ball alarm .
people have gotten the message . gum ?
i am sure you have all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology .
somehow , i do not think that was walt whitman .
actually , gordon , you are not gonna do that . i am taking control of the team .
what ? !
yes , i know .
there s thousands of units like this one .
they are everywhere .
no offense , sir , but why would not he just run ?
because he thinks he is innocent .
two ?
we can stop him .
she is in the room with him when he kills crow . she is already a part of his future .
he cannot download her without a lot of technical help .
no . he cannot . . .
i do not know , why ?
if you were a child killer , you took these pictures , would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find ?
they could have been put away . anderton could have found them .
what kind of cop were you before this ?
i was a treasury agent for eight years . why ?
treasury . . . then this would be your first actual murder scene .
how many ?
none . this was arranged .
i think you are swell company , knott .
it is not at all that you do not trust me to be alone with the chief . that you think i might , you know , fuck with him , if i had the chance . . .
knott !
cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore .
you friend s a murderer and he ruined our perfect record . six years , not one damn murder . . .
who ?
the man across the street . i have seen him before . . .
how can you even tell ? you know how blind you are without your glasses .
i will reschedule . i have been working too much anyway .
i would love to , but i have got an open house today at the ressler place .
ah . that must be why you look so nice .
sure . raincheck .
i forgot my glasses .
i know who you are .
yes .
thanks . you take anything in your coffee ?
cream and sugar .
i do not have any cream . sorry .
just sugar then . you and john ever come here ?
we used to , every summer .
he is not here now , is he ?
thank you . he has not tried to contact you ?
no .
you ever heard him mention the name leo crow ?
no , but then i do not talk to john that much anymore .
so you have not seen his apartment ?
that was our apartment .
have you been there recently ?
you mean after he lost your son .
it was nobody s fault .
but john was with him at the pool ?
yes .
it was not a suicide attempt . i regret ever saying that .
what was it then ?
the fbi found something that belonged to my son . a sandal . . . anyway , john was upset . he . . . he . . .
he took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies . this is all in your statement , lara . . .
he shot a hole in the damn ceiling . so what ? you lose your son , let s see how well you handle it .
not very well , i am sure . i would probably start doping myself . or maybe i would . . .
i left him because every time i looked at him , i saw my son . every time i got close to him , i smelled my little boy . that is why i left him . and now you can leave .
to what ? trap him ?
to prevent a murder . sooner or later , he is going to contact you .
i have not seen him in two years .
but i have seen the three hundred hours of your image he is got stored away .
shhh ! they are sleeping .
tell me how all this works .
what does he want with a precog ?
what do you think ? so he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it .
but there s still the other two .
you do not understand . . . they are a hive mind . it takes all three for their predictive abilities to work .
are you telling me they cannot see murders anymore ?
maybe if he would taken one of the males . but the female , she is the key . she is the one they listen to , the one with the most talent . the one who takes care of the other two .
jesus . . .
what are you talking about ?
maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow . he wants you to come by the office today .
they were grabbing her fucking ass
hey . i do not know , i do not want to know . far as i am concerned , you are a good kid . i got news , though , without you here i cannot keep on your friend . i got enough people pretending to sweep .
do me a favor , arthur , keep him on til i see that is happening .
good luck .

yeah .

it is as good a suite as we have , unless you want two bedrooms .
no . that is cool . bring me back eighty .

manhattan .
you girls are not from brooklyn or anything ?
no .
we are in fashion .
so you are models ?
what happened ? i thought we were playing truth or dare .
look at , ladies . i could sit here and take turns throwing skittles at your ass all night . but i feel what you guys are putting out there . i am only a mirror reflecting what i am getting from you . and i am saying yes to it . i am shaking hands with it . i see the road that you are pointing down and i am saying i will ride shotgun . and when your foot slams on the accelerator , i will not get scared . i will stand up and let the wind blow through my long blonde hair . with my summer dress clinging to my bosom yelling faster , billy ! faster ! drive faster ! faster yet !
somebody s getting comfortable .
holy shit .
i am having fun , sean . can you handle that . . . ? yeah . he does not judge me .
he is okay .
should i fuck him ?
i do not know . do whatever you want .
he is great , right . is he great ?
he is alright .
i know .
but maybe that is okay . maybe that is just what you need .
we used to take baths together .
come on . let s go .
you wanna get us busted ? if max found out you were turning tricks
i got news for you , bobby , he do not give a shit .
bullshit .
you think he do not know ? i give him his cut of seventeen hundred , i think he knows i cannot make that lap dancing .
no more .
and how could you fucking leave horrace hanging ?
i got news for you , horrace got his ass out of there before you did .
bullshit .
what ? you do not think horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang ?
ricky , can you put on a seat belt ?
she is , uh , sleeping .
it is daytime .
mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes . do not you like your pretty clothes ?
no .

bobby , this is a plumb gig . it is a bunch of young agents and it is at a restaurant . it is gonna be easy and we will make a lot of money .
i do not like you working with wendy . why are you working with wendy ?
they requested her . it was her gig . max put me on as a favor .
some favor . i hope they know you are not like wendy .
oh , please .
if they asked for her , they are probably expecting blowjobs all around .
will you cut it out ! get ready , we are already late .
who s watching the baby ?
she is downstairs with ruth . get ready .
i am ready .
bullshit . these are classy customers . you cannot show up all fucked up with a fila running suit on .
they are not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face .
i am not gonna mention ricky to him .
do not expect you to mention it to him . i am just saying , if
the only way he will go with ricky is if you are in too .
well , that is not gonna happen .
fine . you want to help ricky , talk to maxie yourself .
i feel weird asking him .
you should not . he likes you .
i just wish he never brought it up . ricky will not shut up about it .
forget ricky . you should be glad max got you driving for me .
no coke tonight . right ?
leave me alone . i have not touched anything in months .
yeah ? you sure ?
go .
maybe if you did not go rambo every time i did a lapdance , you would still be doing it yourself . meantime , i gotta feed my little girl .
maxie s fucking with me . he put you with the spook to get under my skin .
ho s a good guy
ho s a fucking pimp ! he encourages wendy to turn tricks . and she is his fucking wife !
shhh . he will hear you .
good ! it will save me the trouble of repeating myself . he is not fucking driving you !
listen to me , bobby . this is my job . it puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay .
i want you to quit .
look at the bills . i cannot . i am not gonna put my daughter through what i went through .
i will support you .
with what ?
max offered to stake me .
yeah , well max offers a lot of things . and i got news for you . he is not the sweet old man you think he is .
do not get my hopes up . if i quit , what then ? i cannot go through this again .
how could you let her see this ?
goodbye , bobby .
just so you know , i bought you out with maxie . i suggest you leave while you can .
do not you get it ? i do not want to leave . this is who i am .
tell you the truth , i do not give a shit for me . but that little girl is so special , and you are gonna fuck her up .
what would you say ?
i want you to take her with you .
there s no touching .
but what about them ?
i do not give a shit . i work for her . no touching .
look , man , i am the bachelor , alright ? i gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone
get your hands off of her .
dude , listen , man . i am cool . how much for the treatment ?
your dance is over .
come on , dude . the other chick s giving my best man a blow job in the toilet . i know the drill , i will wear a rubber
i do not get it .
i had a fight up at sportsmangs .
well , you look it . you win ?

.
yeah , well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money .
yeah , sure .
i am serious . humping sheetrock and driving on weekends got to get to you after a while . might be nice to buy your lady something . all it takes is one fight .
you driving her ?
yeah .
she will be out in a minute .
get away from her .
excuse
yeah . where is he ?
nah , man . he is just making contact . that is our man . the welsh guy .
that is his name ?
ruiz do not like using names on cell phones . he refers to him as the red dragon .
so , whengs the drop .
to be honest , man , i do not know shit either . all i know is it ai not drugs and it ai not now .
it is bad . before you even showed up , he said you were maxie s token goons , and not to be trusted . he wanted to tcb alone . i was gonna ride shotgun to keep the english dude above board . now he is spooked . this shit is snowballing .
whengs it going down ?
was gonna be tomorrow morning . now , who knows ?
shit .
this welsh dude is tripping on ruiz cause he is a shot caller .
that is that ?
a shot caller . a boss , a capo . he is running shit .
yeah .
we go and hang out with the dude , make him happy , drink some tea , whatever it takes , until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own . we make the drop , go home to california .
where is this happening ?
we meet at the globe on park avenue at six forty five . i will see you then .
no .
brooklyn .
yeah ?
he must have that shit troughed .
what do you mean troughed ?
troughed off . protected . like , you know , like he got a moat around it .
ruiz tied in out there ?
nah , man . no one is . they got some puerto ricans and a new crop of fuckin irish immigrants .
they ran shit back in the eighties . used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar . that is back when the irish was making a play against the italians . i do not know if they still around , but i do not fuck with those motherfuckers just in case .
it sounds to me like everybody s just a little jumpy . and since all it is is a drop , the welshmangs got nothing at stake . i say we go to his troughed off bar . it will calm his nerves , we drop the bag , and we all get back to our lives .
and not a word to maxie . he will shit if he knew we crossed a bridge .
quick drop . in and out .
where is ricky ?
ricky s taken care of .
how so ?
he was uptown when i paged him . i gave him the address . he is meeting us there .
that it ?
that is it .
where is ricky .
i guess inside . or he never made it . either way , i do not give a shit . let s get this over with .
sure . yeah .
you bet the ponies ?
me ? no . not really .
smart . hard as hell to handicap . you know what i like ? hai alai . fast game . you know why i like it ?
why ?
it is fixed . that is the only way to win . a sure thing . see that horse . the blaze .
this one ?
yeah . the blaze . i bought her in . hired a trainer , stall , whatever it was . that horse made me over a hundred grand . in sixties dollars . you know what that is today ?
pshhh . . .
a million . easy .
she was fast , huh ?
never won a race . but it got me in with the trainer . we would have a thing , i do not remember , some fucking thing . the jockey would raise his whip , it meant the fix was in , we would all go running . people get greedy . first they bet small , they keep their mouth shut . within a month s time , everyone and their brother was in on it . the odds would drop , i mean you could watch the goddamn board . it looked like a fuckin stopwatch , the odds would drop so fast .
that is why they call it the smart money .
mr . reuben , i swear to god , they were out of line .
last time , maybe , with the puerto ricans , but these were nice jewish boys .
they were out of line
they are fucking yeshiva buchas . you did not have to tear up the goddamn place . you knocked out a guys teeth .
that prick tried to get jessica to blow him in the bathroom
bobby , i love jessica like she is my own daughter . i would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter , but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in beverly hills and wants i should buy him an implant . your silverback horseshit is gonna cost me eight grand .
i will work it off .
not driving jess , you will not .
what ?
you are not driving jess no more . two strikes , bobby , and this last one was big . the bachelor s father goes to my schul .
so , that is it . i am out ?
i did not say that .
then what are you saying ?
bobby . you are a bull terrier and i got you herding sheep .
i do not understand .
it is my fault . i send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life , then i wonder why you seered . it is my fault . the tooth is on me . but no more . i am areassigning you .
i do not want to drive another girl , max . the only reason i am
who the fuck do you think you are talking to ? this ai not a fucking democracy . you want out ?
no .
do not i put food on you are table ? i sponsor your training , i take care of your girl and her little baby . i even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom .
i know .
now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what i got to say ?
yeah . sorry .
i got a way we make everybody happy .
yeah .
we try something out . there s someone i am in business with named ruiz . i want you to accompany him on a drop . just as scenery . ruiz has his boys . i just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench . as a deterrent .
ruiz knows about this ?
ruiz wants to go alone , but it is not up to ruiz . it is up to me , and i like a sure thing . just go and we are square on the tooth .
what about ricky ? he would jump at the opportunity .
ricky ? ricky i lost the truck ricky ?
you told him you liked him .
that was before he lost my carpet cleaning van .
he will work it off .
i do not know the kid , and what little i do scares me .
he is good people , mr . reuben . i swear .
you vouch for him ?
how about this . if you are in , he is in .
i gotta tell you , mr . reuben , i am not comfortable getting in any deeper . it is one thing to look after jess . . .
you are ready to move up . christ , the way you busted up the place , you are doing worse already . may as well get paid instead of punished .
it is not that i do not appreciate the offer . . .
do me a favor . think about it . is that too much too ask ?
no . okay . i will think about it .

yeah , i know how you do . i know how you do . i have heard your kibbles and bits all fucking night . you have been shaking your ass like an unemployed clown . how the room s a boiling pot of sugar water . how you are gonna dip a string into it and make rockcandy . who wants to play just the tip ? dancing around like a smacked ass . oh , and that coat check girl you have been dragging around as insurance does not even speak english .
i swear to god , i did not do anything .
she was jonesing for me .
that is up ?
he wants to see us now .
where ?
he said it is being arranged . he said jimmy will know .
we are getting whacked .
we are not getting whacked .
why else you think he will not tell us where the sit down is ?
it is not a sit down . he said he is telling us the plan .
i got a bad feeling , man . i do not want to go in naked .
you gonna shank him in the shower ?
is it so unrealistic to think ruiz , who does not even want us here , is throwing us to the wolves ? as an apology ? and i do not even know what we are dropping off or picking up
we are getting ahead of ourselves . we have not gotten any sleep . let s just keep our mouthes shut and not make any mistakes . now hurry up and get your shit on so we are not late and make things worse .
c mon , man . . .
i swear to god , i will fucking puke .
hey , jimmy , where they taking us ?

did you hear what he just said ?
whatever . we are here . we may as well go to the penguin house .
i am tired and i am scared , and i am not looking at fucking penguins .
we do not need guns .
i am pretty sure we do .
i listened extremely carefully . nothing was even vaguely implied . he even laughed in your face when you asked him
all the more reason .
you would not even know where to get one .
wanna bet ?
you could not even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse , how you gonna get a gun ?
that is cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden .
it was six in the fucking morning .
float me a hundred bucks .
why ?
you wanna see how fast i get a gun ?
you are out of money ?
no .
what do you have left ?

you did ?
yes i did . you asshole ! what about the room ?
what about it ?
they only cover one fifty in incidentals . you have been ordering fucking . . . motherfucker . . .
i fucking vouched for you . i vouched for you and you fucked me .
this shit is peanuts compared to what we are gonna make with maxie .
ricky . i am trying to save this money . understand ? i am trying to make it so my girlfriend does not have to grind her ass into other mengs erections so her daughter can go to private school .
i am sorry . . .

it is gonna be fine .
no more , man .
let s get some sleep . that is what we need , man . sleep .
how we gonna sleep ? we only got a few hours til dinner .
so what do we do ?
let s just go now and wait .
three and a half hours ?
i do not want to take any more chances .
let s just go get guns , i would feel better .
do not fuck around . you are gonna get us all killed .
think about it you knocked out that jewish kid s tooth , cost him eight grand , maybe more . maybe lost his whole line of clientele ? he knows you are fucking up jess dancing , and i got a feeling he knows i stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me . he cannot kill us in la cause that leads to too many questions . so he flies us out here first class for a wouldrop that is turned into whatever ? he can make us disappear out here real nice . . .
where do you get this shit ?
scenario b . i think i am getting under ruiz s skin . i am no dummy . he does not like how it went down with the red drag welshman , whatever . now i got fruitpie the magician telling me i cannot call my man max ? and that welshmangs sketchy . whatever , i do not know where it is coming , which way it is coming from , i am telling you one thing right now , i am not gonna be late for the dance .
you are not getting a gun .

he has a cute what . . . ?
outfit ? that is he talking about ?
shut it , man . shut it . tom is a square . he do not but dabble in shit . maxie had me hook up a loan back with him , through an austrian passbook account .
so , we are talking money laundering . . .
will you tell peter jennings to shut up and fucking listen . the shit is as routine as you get . i coulda turned it over offshore in a week , but maxie likes to do it all his way . safe . i coulda dropped the bag alone . it is only two hundred g s . but he sent you all . so i can either send you home and tell maxie , or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down .

that is the last stuff you will ever get from me .
what did you give it to me for then ?
cause you needed it . cause you could not hear me without it .
when you go busting your fists against a stone wall , you are not using your brains . cause that is what the white man wants you to do . look at you .
man , you been locked up too long , everybody conks . all the cats .
why ? why does everybody conk ?
cause i do not want to walk around with my head all nappy , looking like
like what ? looking like me ? like a nigger ? ! why do not you want to look like what you are ? what makes you ashamed of being black ?
i ai not said i am ashamed .
let it burn . maybe you will hear me then .
man , i do not want to hear all that .
i thought you was smart . but you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you . like a monkey . and the white man sees you and he laughs . he laughs because he knows you ai not white .
elijah who ?
elijah muhammad can get you out of prison . out of the prison of your mind . maybe all you want is another fix . i thought you were smart .
i ai not never seen a cat like you . ai not you scared talking like that in front of an ofay ?
that is he gonna do to me he ai not already done ?
you the only cat do not come on with that whatcha know , daddy jive and you do not cuss none .
i respect myself . a man cuss because he has not got the words to say that is on his mind .
tell you this you ai not no fool .
do not con me . do not try . . .
okay , okay .
do not con me .
what do you do with your time ?
i read . i study . because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself . respect his body and his mind . quit taking the white mangs poison into your body his cigarettes , his dope , his liquor , his white woman , his pork .
that is what mama used to say .
your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy beast part rat , part cat , and the rest is dog .
i am telling you god s words , not no hustle . i am talking the words of elijah , the black mangs god . i am telling you , boy , that god is black .
what ? everybody knows god is white .
but everything the white man taught you , you learned . he told you you were a black heathen and you believed him . he told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light . and you believed him . he taught you to worship a blond , blue eyed god with white skin and you believed him . he told you black was a curse , you believed him . did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary ?
what for ?
did you ever study anything was not part of some con ?
what the hell for , man ?
go on , fool the marble shooters are waiting for you .
okay , okay . show me , man .
soiled with dirt , foul sullen , hostile , forbidding as a black day . foully or outrageously wicked , as black cruelty . indicating disgrace , dishonor or culpability .
they sure ai not no black mangs books in here .
then what you telling me to study in them for ?
you got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him . the truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words . it is buried there . you got to dig it out .
man , how m i gonna know the ones worth looking at ?
look em up and and out what they mean .
where am i gonna start ?
start at the beginning . page one , the first one . here
read it and keep on reading .
lemme tell you about history black history . you listening ?
the first men on earth were black . they ruled and there was not one white face anywhere . but they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees . black men were never like that .
a black man playing big league ball is something .
i told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth . they let us sing and dance and smile and now they let one black man in the majors . that do not cancel out the greatest crime in history . when that blue eyed devil locked us in chains , , of us broke up our families , tortured us , cut us off from our language , our religion , our history .
no . that is the name of the slave master who owned your family . you do not even know who you are . you are nothing . less than nothing . a zero . who are you ?
who are you ?
then the devil is white .
i knew you would hear me . the white man is the devil . all white men are devils .
i sure met some .
no . elijah muhammad does not say that white man is a devil . he teaches us that the white man is the devil . all white men .
i will not touch the white mangs poison his drugs , his liquor , his carrion , his women .
a muslim must be strikingly upright . outstanding . so those in the darkness can see the power of the light .
but the key to islam is submission . that is why twice daily we turn to mecca , to the holy of holies , to pray . we bend our knees in submission .
for evil to bend its knee , admit its guilt , implore his forgiveness , is the hardest thing on earth
i want to , bembry , but i cannot .
the hardest and the greatest .
i cannot .
for evil to bend its knee , admit its guilt , implore his forgiveness , is the hardest thing on earth
i want to , bembry , but i cannot .
the hardest and the greatest .
i do not know what to say to allah .
have you ever bent your knees , malcolm ?
tell him that .
i do not know how .
you can grovel and crawl for sin , but not to save your soul . pick the lock , malcolm pick it .
i want to . god knows i want to .
i am sure we can . this is a new sister , sister betty .
i am telling you god s words , not to hustle .
you want a new car ? you want a new house ? is that it ? it is the money , right ?
mr . x , i was out there tonight . i saw what you did . i want to be a muslim . i ai not never seen a negro stand up to the police like that .
not exactly , but i want to be one , like you .
i admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly .
mr . x , i will not make you out a liar .
brother benjamin , do not rush , it has to be exact .
all praises are due to allah . thank you , brother minister .
come , sit with us .
no , brother minister .
why not ? you have had ample time , you and the sister .
next week , brother minister .
has the reverend called ? is he going to show ?
and now , without further remarks , i present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you
she ate .
if you want to tell me .
shall i tell my sisters that we oppose marriage ?
that you have not time for either marriage or eating
let me explain . no . i will do better than that . i will show it to you . scientifically . but it is demonstration purely in the interest of science , you understand ?
so it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat . the meat itself is foul .
i am sorry . i have had you on your feet for hours .
you have been on your feet for days . and did not even finish your salad .
what ?
sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda .
how do you like it ?
delicious .
there s nothing to talk about .
oh , yes , there is . i know a lot about you . brother bembry briefed me .
oh ? purely scientific interest i am sure .
you are from detroit , near where i come from . you majored in education at tuskegee . you are studying nursing and having trouble with your family .
i can handle it .
they want you to quit the muslims or they will not pay your tuition , is not that it ?
you have enough worries of your own .
no , good sisters are rare . we need every one . tell me something how tall are you ?
why do you ask ?
just an idle question .
if it is just idle , i will not answer it .
how old are you , betty ?
there s a few things you do not know about women , brother malcolm . they are possessive and vain .
are you ?
and dogged when i set my mind to something .
what have you set your mind to ?
being a good muslim , a good nurse and a good wife .
i know .
at a gas station . will you marry me ?
yes .
did you hear what i said ?
yes i did . did you hear my answer ?
i think so . can you catch a plane ?
yes . did you eat ?
i love you .
just hold me .
it will be rough .
hush your mouth .
i will be away a lot .
you are with me even when you are away .
what do you think ?
the simplest thing in the world i want to have a lot of babies with you . dear heart , i love you .
because you are in trouble .
how do you know ?
i am not made of glass .
i just want to sit here and be still .
we have never had a fight . not a real one . but we are going to have one right now if you do not talk about it .
talk about what ?
the talk is everywhere !
there s always talk , always been talk , and always will be talk . do not they say how i am trying to take over the nation , how i am getting rich off the nation ?
we will get to that , too , but this is not just talk any more .
there are always slanders , always lies . you are reading the devil s lies . cannot you see they are trying to bring us down , bring down the messenger .
both women , in their s , charged they had had intimacies with elijah muhammad since . . .
i was going to talk to bembry about it tonight .
to bembry ? is bembry your friend ?
woman , have you lost your mind ? that is the matter with you ?
i am not interested in personal publicity . our people know what i am doing .
do you know what bembry is doing ? you are so blind , everyone can see this but you ! ! !
bembry saved my life . the honorable elijah muhammad saved my life .
a long time ago . you have repaid them many times over . ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture .
is that what this is about ? material wealth ?
what do we have , malcolm . a broken down jalopy and the clothes on our backs . we do not even own our own home . what about our children ? what about me ? you do not even own life insurance .
the nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me .
will they ? are you sure ? are you sure or are you blind ?
what do you want me to do ? our people need me .
we need you too !
what do you want me to do ?
open your eyes , you can face death hours a day but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind . if you will not do that for yourself do it for us .
you have to sleep for three .
shhh !
families should not be separated . i will never make another long trip without you and the kids . we will all be together .
dear heart , i love you .
we had the best organization that black people ever had and niggers ruined it .
betty it is me . it is me .
do not answer the phone . it is all right . it is all right . nothing is gonna happen to anybody .
dear heart , where are you ?
at the hilton . the girls asleep ?
i just put them to bed . can we come to the meeting tomorrow ?
i do not think that is such a good idea .
i am tired of praying .
that is enough , brother earl .
let s get out of this cold .
malcolm , where are you ? we have been calling all over the city .
let some of us come down there .
no , that will not be necessary . i will be all right .
i wish you would listen to us . what about the meeting tomorrow ? we need to frisk people .
i do not want folks to be searched , it makes people uncomfortable . if i cannot be safe among my own kind , where can i be ? allah will protect me .
so now we have no opening speaker ? why was not i informed last night ?
i called sister betty , she did not tell you ?
since when do you start telling sister betty my business ? since when ? she has nothing to do with this . you tell me , not her , not anybody else .
i assumed . . .
what did i tell you about assuming ?
the way i feel , i ought not to go out there today . in fact , i am going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself that is all a part of the white mangs big maneuver , to keep us fighting amongst ourselves , against each other . i am not fighting anyone , that is not what we are here for .
let s cancel .
is my family here yet ?
down front as always .
preacher , take your tin jesus and the virgin mary , both , and shove em .
you have been talking about the disciples . what color were they ?
i do not think we know for certain .
that is right .
as jesus was . jesus was also a hebrew .
just what is your question ?
what color were the original hebrews ?
i told you we do not know for certain .
then we do not know that god was white .
but we do know that the people of that region of asia minor , from the tigris euphrates valley to the mediterranean , are dark skinned people . i have studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels . i have never seen a native of that area who was not black .
just what are you saying ?
i am not saying anything , preacher . i am proving to you that god is black .
please , go ahead .
mr . malcolm x , why do you teach black supremacy ? why do you teach hate ?
for the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped , or the wolf asking the sheep , do you hate me ! the white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate .
you put it very well .
you left one phrase out . another educated kneegrew said to me and i quote brother malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the negro subculture . would you agree ?
entirely .
well , i have this to say . do you know what a negro with a b . a . , an m . a . and a ph . d . is called by the white man ? i will tell you . he is called a nigger .
thank you . now the negro in the field caught hell all day long . he was beaten by the master he lived in a shack , wore castoff clothes and hated his master . if the house caught fire , he would pray for a wind . if the master got sick , he would pray that he would die . and if you said to him , let s go , let s separate , he would yell , yeah , man , any place is better than this . you have got a lot of field negroes in america today . i am one .
women are deceitful . they are untrustworthy flesh . i have seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women .
let me do it then .
no , each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing . allah has given you a great gift . use it wisely , never forgetting that we are nothing , while he is all .
allah akbar .
yes , sir , i did .
that was a very bad statement . the country loved this man , and you have made it hard in general for muslims .
sure , man .
are you elijah s pimp ?
what ?
his greatest greatness .
say what you are saying .
if you do not know , man , then i feel sorriest for you .
i say a lot of things .
and like a fool i believe it .
do your job , get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of lucky s .
mind your own goddamn business . . . she comes in a lot ?
about every other night , red .
with him ?
if she got eyes , she do .
not yet . but the way things going , that boy gonna turn her out any day .
two years in the womengs reformatory at framingham .
but our crime was not burglary . it was balling white girls . they gave us the book .
burglary , count one to years count two , to years count three , to years . . .
the sentences to run concurrently .
shorty thought he hit us with years till i explained what concurrently meant . it meant a minimum sentence of years hard labor at the charlestown state prison . the date was february . i was not quite . i had not yet begun to shave .
now you come back .
i ai not stupid .
i mean it is late , baby .
i know where you are going .
i am going to bed . i gotta work tomorrow , need my rest .
what for ? i ai not white and i do not put out .
all them books you read and you still do not know nuthin .
i do know i love you .
why ? is it because of your white gal ? folks say you are running around town with her .
save it , baby . save it for mr . right , cause your grandma s smarter than ya think .
murder .
there is a serious question as to whether
these are my children . mine . and they ai not no question . none .
i think sometimes , mrs . little , candor is the only kindness .
all of your children are delinquent , mrs . little , and one , at least , malcolm is a thief .
get out .
your control over your children , therefore
did you hear me ? !
you will regret this , mrs . little .
if you do not move out through that door , you are going to be past all regretting .
.
make it . we got a lot of fishing to do .
brother malcolm , i want you to meet brother earl . he just joined the nation .
please make way , please
how long has this been going on ?
all day since you and betty left . brother minister , i have to level with you . they gave me a mission . but i could not do it . i love y all .
what mission ?
to wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition . the ministers say you are spreading untruths about the messenger . the ministers say you are a great hypocrite , judas , benedict arnold . the ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the messenger s doorstep .
what does sidney say ?
i am with you , brother minister .
no . you will be marked for death .
let me die then .
i will not let myself come between you and your father . go home .
you are my father .
and do not come back .
. . . that is not a whore ?
shhhh ! i do not like women that talk .
c mere .
you hear me , girl ?
you better believe it .
that is your story , baby ?
me ?
you will , baby if the time come .
lemme feed you , sweetie , while they hot .
well , bitch you move too slow .

jesus christ , homey , you are nuts .
it is not a hype , shorty . and i meant what i said join us .

what can you do ?
so what about him ?

eddie , let s see that blotter .
watch your tongue , boy .
do not you call me boy , you pig . letting a man bleed like that .
he told you that ?
yes sir .
are you sure ?
yes , i am , brother minister . all i want is support for my children . he should provide for his children . that is all i want .
allah will provide .
this is your room , malcolm . i know you will keep it clean .
this is malcolm , our new guest . we will treat him like a brother .
i was special . the only colored kid in class . i became a sort of mascot . like a pink poodle .
i did not know then that i was a nigger .
he is bright .
they talked about me like
good grades . fine athlete . president of his class .
i was not there . like i was some kind of pedigreed dog or a horse . like i was invisible .
believe it or not , you are safe here . the judicial police will kill you . if they can . this page ?
no .
am i a suspect ?
no . it would be convenient , but no .
all these photos you just saw were of policemen . sadly they are protected . la hermanidad . the brotherhood .
it is what you and rosanna named me . right ?
sit , creasy . everything that happens from now on does so with my permission . really . you will not find a better carne asada in all of mexico .
what do you want ?
the same thing as you . except , my reach is not as long as yours . my father was a policemen , did you know that ?
i do not know shit about you .
he was one of the original founders of le hermanidad in the days when it represented good not evil .
it is not worth it . be with them instead .
it galls me to watch you . you can do as much in days as i can in years . men like the the dreamer are protected . out of everyone s grasp it seems , but yours .
are you going to arrest me or talk me to death ?
so you are going to talk me to death .
you walk out and deal justice . you are what i wish i could be . the policemen who kills you , his family will have all they want .
then i hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids . what do you want ?
i want to arrest you for murder ! i want to shake your hand and reload your gun ! i want to kill my pride and give you my blessing .
my deal is with rosanna . i knew you guys were up to something . are you two fucking ?
no , but i have to admit i thought about it .
liar . just tell me who the bank card belongs to . name and address .
you have no interest in making things easy , do you ?
i am not . . . easy .
off the top of my head , i do not know what they could have been .
south america .
where are you staying in mexico ?
i am on to juarez .
why ?
i have a friend there .

i want you .
this is not possible . but in that house i have money . if i tell you where
your brother wants to talk to you .
listen ! i will give you a life for a life .
what do you mean ?
her life for your life .
you are a liar . pinta s dead .
i am a businessman . a dead girl is worth nothing . she is alive .
and one of the founding members of la hermanidad .
correct !
it is all up to you , commandante . tell me about you and the dreamer .
lucky how ?
that he used policemen . that you killed them , it made it a police matter . the ramos family could not refuse our involvement .
and ?
and i had my men ready .
you stole the drop .
o . k . so tell me more .
there was no ten million dollars .
the ransom was ten .
two and a half . that is how much there was .
do not lie to me !
two and a half ! the rest was paper ! strips of paper !
no . whoever took the rest took it before the exchange .
who gave the bags to ramos ?
his lawyer . jordan kalfus .
that is what everybody keeps saying .
yes .
show me , please .
nine millimeter . a sig sauer .
have you used this type before ?
it is loaded .
i drink .
how does it affect you ?
my coordination . reaction time . if top professionals try to kidnap your daughter , the service will be on par with the pay .
and what if amateurs try it ?
i will probably kill them . is that likely ?
no . and no one is to know of your drinking problem . that includes my wife .
creasy ? ? ? where the fuck are you ?
i am here .
what do you mean , i am here ?
i am in a customs holding tank in mexico city international . bring a bunch of cash . . . about k . i am going to need it .
listen it was a calculated risk . i have done it a million times and never got caught .
everything happens once if you live long enough .
it does not make sense to x ray your bags coming off the plane .
this is mexico , they do everything backwards .
nothing wrong .
do not give me that bullshit .
japanese are here in a big way . cheap labor . factory space . but they feel a lot safer living over the border in el paso . i ferry em back and forth . they think i am john fucking wayne .
but do not you stay in el paso ?
fuck , i love mexico . i live like a king down here .
oh , like you have not been in worse places .
and a level five shithole is better than a level six . your logic s inescapable .
not for eight months . i was in columbia looking around , but , nothing seemed interesting .
how long you staying , crease ?
got no plans , rayburn , nothing on . just wanted to see you , how you were . came by on impulse .
everything happens once if you live long enough .
you are crazy . people would hire a has been , ray ? a drunk ?
well , you would have to keep it under control .
and what if , just say , there was a kidnap attempt ?
you do your best . they will not be paying you enough to perform miracles .
a bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time . willing to talk . i am not good at that .
so you will be the silent type . people will appreciate that .
i came to visit you .
bullshit . i have known you fifteen years . you do not visit .
a bodyguard . . . who s the guy ?
samuel ramos . owns one of the plants in juarez . the jap car industry is in the toilet . he is trying to persuade ford to partner with him . i think he is in trouble . he asked me if i knew anyone he could trust .
oh , now you think i can be trusted .
take a job , creasy . breathe some air . then decide if you want to . . . stick around or not .
you got tossed . do not trust the cops , especially the judicials . oh you know that ?
i mean nothing . the hammer came down and nothing happened . dimple on the primer .
i have heard of it . never happened to me though . maybe the firing pings off .
maybe . . .
sorry i woke you , ray .
i said the plan was right here .
pinta . . .
two days gone . they are negotiating a ransom .
i will get you up to the border . friend of mine will take you in to san diego . drop you right at the hospital .
yes or no ?
i will not kill again . hunt people . i gave that up . anything else ? it is yours .
i know it is old fashioned , but it is reliable . like us .
different door . not far from here .
if they like me .
frank does not take to most people . do you speak german ?
ein klines bisschen . a tiny bit .
frank only responds to commands in german . he was trained in frankfurt . my dad loves the idea of having a dog around , but hates the fact he lives inside .
who s emilio ?
my last bodyguard . he drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon .
creasy . just call me creasy .
creasy . . .
the united states .
i know . but which state ?
you can drive and talk at the same time , cannot you ?
no .
why not ?
i am looking for potential .
places where the road bends , places away from buildings , places where the traffic thins out . but you do not have to understand . i do . so no talking .
are you going to quit ? my last bodyguard quit .
let me guess , you would not stop talking ?
someone gave him more money than we could .
i am a bargain .
being black , is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in mexico ?
time will tell .
there were kidnappings in mexico city in the last six days . four a day . what do you think about that , mr . creasy ?
pretty impressive . maybe i need to up my fee or get a larger gun .
that is right .
no .
not at all ?
no .
but why not ?
it was not a school like yours and there was no sister anna .
so you were unhappy ?
being unhappy is a state of mind . i never thought about it .
oh . . .
i am not crying .
i go to school , do not i ?
once i get in the water but not starting off . by the time i catch up , it is too late .
calling for emilio s macaw . i thought i heard him .
do you think he will come back ?
maybe . did you hear him ?
no .
how do you think he got out ?
well , i let him go .
it is better to be free , right ?
yes . actually , he was driving me crazy .
they can stay for two weeks . i do not care .
where ?
everywhere !
my ankle .
white lie . i did not have a family . but i did have two kids . they are adults now .
i am too old for him . do not tell my friends .
i do not talk to them much . does he have a name ?
yes .
how is the ankle ? can you put your weight on it ?
it is not too bad . will it take a long time before it is better ? our big swim meet is in three weeks . interschools . i was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle .
in a week you should be fine .
you need to practice .
it was in a book at school . concubine .
but the emperor of china had of them ! how can that be ?
in the west , it is one wife for one husband , but different cultures have different rules .
it must be difficult having lots of wives .
you feel sorry for the husband ?
yeah . can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand ?
i had to do my homework on them when i worked there . also i enjoy history .
what did you do in asia ? is that where you met the man with cigarettes ?
no , that was in columbia .
i do not understand .
do not worry . you will .
yes .
where you are from is not so much about geography it is about events . where you are from is what happened to you .
good things happen , too , creasy . like meeting me .
i guess that really does make me a hard case .
no .
did you used to ?
yeah . two or three .
i am sorry .
you were never late before , i was worried .
i dropped her at home .
it is no wonder you are late . why did not she just come with you ?
i know you are not .
are you afraid of me ?
the gunshot holds no fear .
you welcome the sound . the sound is what lets you go . the sound is what frees you . you are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound .
there s no such thing as tough . you are either trained or untrained .
your father has business .
why today ? and why would she have to go with him ?
i am a prisoner in them . until the gunshot sets me free .
could i stop you ?
you do not drink like you used to .
that is not a question .
i know because i go in your room and check the bottles .
still not a question .
my mom drinks , too . . . why do people drink , creasy ?
now that is a question . i do not know about your mom . for me , the problem is not in the glass . the problem s in between my ears .
you think too much ?
yeah . because at one time , i did not think enough .
frank . frankie .
you should break all my fingers , creasy , then tape them back together . i will not be able to play the piano , but i could still swim .
do not be a baby . you are tougher than that .
there s no such thing as tough , creasy . just trained and untrained .
then be trained .
i am going to keep people safe someday . just like you .
be a swimmer .
i could do it . remember the day you wanted the pencil ? i know why . and i saw that car again . i wrote the license number in my notebook . except i missed the last number .
dyslexic ?
like st . jude . a hopeless case that has a complete block about c minor . but remember , whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves . new testament , romans .
you got that right .
you will be back in the water in twenty four hours .
it is war . the weakest suffer the most .
you are american .
so are you .
never .
i am fine .
is the food alright ? maria tells me that you did not eat .
the food s fine . sometimes i do not eat .
it insults maria . slip it to the dog if you have to . . . do you mind if i talk to you for a moment ?
we will be okay once she realizes i am not a new toy .
yes , she told me . do you have children , mr . creasy ?
no .
you should know they are tenacious when they want something . and pinta wants to be friends .
you are paying me to protect her , not amuse her . right ?
no , you are right . you were hired to protect her , that is enough . i am confident you will do that .
it is serious , mrs . ramos .
please , it is lisa . . . i will be coming with you tomorrow . i have lunch with friends .
the traffic takes some getting used to .
if something happened , my reaction would be to fight to protect her . i have skills in that respect . pinta would benefit by the fact that . . . i am a soldier .
because . . . i was already dead .
planned what ?
an autosequestra . kalfus arranged for pinta to be taken to a safehouse . i am sure he thought she would sit there for three days eating pizza and watching tv . it did not work out that way . everything got fucked up when i killed the cops and tazinari saw an opportunity .
i want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between reforma and the freeway junction . in minutes .
you are lying . i do not believe you .
then do not come .
stay here . if you do something stupid , we will not get her back .
it is creasy .
where are you ?
los arcos . was a little girl kidnapped recently ? about twelve maybe ?
last night . do you know something ?
what was her name ?
camila . camila valencias .
and now every mother with money in mexico city wants bigger and better bodyguards . my own wife included .
if she pisses you off , you get another one .
do you know what she told me last night ?
yeah ? and if she was ugly ?
i have a policy , aig . it covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days , without a bodyguard , i will not be able to renew it .
i know you need to please lisa . an ass like that is hard to find . good bodyguards are even harder .
i know ! i just had to let one go because i could not afford him !
for a year ?
for a few months . hire someone cheap . you have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance . then fire him for incompetence . the important thing is lisa s daughter will return to school .
her beauty fucks with your mind .
for an american she understands this country very well .
she understands men .
yes .
ok , repeat the drop instructions .
the money , million u . s . will be divided into two gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the k r agent . then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car .
the car will not be powerful and have no trunk .
no . why ?
he has a heart condition . angina . he responds badly to stress .
ok . you will arrive at columbus circle and reforma avenue at am . you will drive around the square two times . samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to i . d . the car .
i am trying , mom .
when ?
samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard . it may take a few days , but you are going back .
we will see . and thank your father in the morning . a man always needs to be thanked .
this is mr . creasy .
you do ?
he is like a great big bear . creasy bear . . .
well , think about going to sleep . good night , baby .
do not forget your towel .
you are going to miss mexican halloween . the day of the dead .
and bankruptcy . where will that put me in the social strata ?
i am only asking for one thing . and it is not an extravagance . it is not even for me it is for our daughter .
our daughter .
these people are professionals . they do not waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt .
samuel , it is not something we should skimp on . a bodyguard s presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent . now he is gone , i feel totally exposed .
lisa martin ramos , mr . creasy .
do you have any family , mr . creasy ?
i think it is fantastic .
you realize that you have brought a killer into the house .
hmm ?
creasy . pinta likes him .
pinta loves school . she would like count dracula is he took her back there .
what ? who ?
creasy .
why ? you were so pleased with him .
pinta likes him too much . she thinks of him as a father .
that is ridiculous .
it is not .
he has to go .
she is young . she will get over it .
i was not thinking of pinta .
is that good or bad ?
that is good . really good . he shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack . they are saying he is responsible .
he sounded strong to me . stronger than we are .
we did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings , including the little girl . the same man the dreamer . listen to this .
creasy is not a policeman . my sense is he could be very valuable to us .
it is a moral issue . on one hand you are cleaning up the bad guys , but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys .
and left three more dead men .
no . not by the rules of polite society at least .
i think he is . . . magnificent .
you only give information so you can fuck me .
a beautiful circle .
i should start going for your tits first .
he is the man , the boss ? my guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots . we had to inject the whole barrio . we bugged the house and stole the picture of him .
i am sure he is not . though he is certainly adept at killing .
he was doing his job , protecting the girl . if police were involved , you figure it out . i am here for him .
so am i .
i already ate .
you just said it . he is my friend . nothing else to say .
i read the file . you and creasy have been seen quite a bit together .
two tourists who never went home .
you helped him get this job .
that is what friends do .
yes . but if i traced creasy to you , others will do it as well . their facilities are as good as my own , if not better .
i can take care of myself .
you and creasy both . a two man army according to interpol . panama . lebanon with the druze . desert storm . where you were contracted by the u . s . army to hunt down elite iraqi military commanders . you two were a married couple .
the kind that gets divorced , but still stay friends .
what happened to him ? what happened to creasy ?
this is my jurisdiction . i want these men as much as creasy does .
he will deliver more justice in a weekend , than ten years of your courts and tribunals . so stay out of his way .
i plan to . i will even help him if i can . he is going to lead me to the the dreamer . someone i want very badly . but i would like to understand him . give me that .
pinta martin ramos is just a number to you . tragic , a public outcry , but a number . one more dead .
what was she to creasy then ?
light . at the end of a long , dark tunnel . somehow , she showed him it was alright to live again .
and they took that away .
a man can be an artist in anything . stone , paint , words . food . anything if his soul is true to it . creasy s art is death . and he is about to paint his masterpiece .
she is all right , andy . it is just that i get one saturday night off every three weeks , and i was expecting something better , that is all .
i told you she was not attractive . . .
you told me that she was a little tall , but that she was not bad looking at all .
millie s been after me to fix her up with a date , so i . . .
all right , i am having a fair time . it is just that i get one saturday night off in three weeks , and i wanted to wind up with something tonight .
what ?
you wanna have a drink before we start dancing ?
listen . you people go grab a table . i will be back inna minute . i will be right back .
i do not know , ang . wadda you feel like doing ?
well , we oughta do something . it is saturday night . i do not wanna go bowling like last saturday . how about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the rko chester ?
which one was that ?
that big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend .
oh , yeah .
we took them home alla way out in brooklyn . her name was mary feeney . what do you say ? you think i oughta give her a ring ? i will take the skinny one .
she probably got a date by now , angie .
well , let s call her up . what can we lose ?
i did not like her , angie . i do not feel like calling her up .
well , what do you feel like doing tonight ?
i do not know . what do you feel like doing ?
well , we are back to that , huh ? i say to you , what do you feel like doing tonight ? and you say to me , i do not know , what do you feel like doing ? and then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer , watching sid caesar on television . well , i tell you what i feel like doing . i feel like calling up this mary feeney . she likes you .
what makes you say that ?
i could see she likes you .
yeah , sure .
i will call her up .
you call her up for yourself , angie . i do not feel like calling her up .
angie , i am thirty four years old . i been looking for a girl every saturday night of my life . i am tired of looking . everybody s always telling me to get married . get married . get married . do not you think i wanna get married ? i wanna get married . they drive me crazy . now , i do not wanna wreck your saturday night for you , angie . you wanna go somewhere , you go ahead . i do not wanna go .
my old lady , every word outta her mouth , when you gonna get married ?
my mother , boy , she drives me crazy .
i do not know . what do you feel like doing ?

well , waddaya say , you wanna ask them ? i will take the one inna green dress .

oh , i could not eat nothing . my mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws .
i was gonna call that girl from last night . take her to a movie tonight .

you got me mad , that is why . hey , joe , show marty that picture .
i do not feel like going , angie . i thought i would take this girl to a movie .
boy , you really musta made out good last night .
we just talked .

she musta kept you inna shadows all night .
brush her . listen , you wanna come with me tonight , or you wanna go with this dog ?
waddaya getting so sore about ?
i looked all over for you last night , you know that ?

he was here last night till about two o clock . i hear you really got stuck with a dog last night .
who told you that ?
angie . he says she was a real scrawny looking thing .
she was not so bad .
i came to see you . how you feel ?
i been getting a pain in my shoulder .
i gotta pains in my shoulder too . i have a pain in my hip , and my right arm aches so much i cannot sleep . it is a curse to be old . how you feel ?
i feel fine .
that is nice .
that is nice . i gotta letter from my husband s cousin in abruzzi . his mother died .
oh .
do you remember emilio digiorgio , owned the tavern in abruzzi ?
i do not think i remember him .
well , he died . you know who else died ?
who ?
you know the old man upstairs in this house . old irishman , always drunk . he got pleurisy . he was inna hospital two weeks . he died yesterday .
well , i always like to visit you , catherine , because you always got such cheerful news .
it is her baby too , you know .
that is my son thomas s baby .
well , it ai not your baby .
did i tell you she threw the bottle a milk at me ?
you told me .
she is a witch , that one . i tell you what happen yesterday ?

she gave me the evil eye .
i keep one eye open when i sleep , because she is gonna come in , stab me in my bed .
catherine , i want you come live in my house with marty and me .

who ?
your son thomas and his wife virginia . . .
when was this ?
this afternoon , about four , five o clock .
what they say ?
you know what they say . they say things are no good in this house . catherine , your son is married . leave him in peace . he wantsa be alone with his wife . they do not want no old lady sitting inna balcony . now i tell you what i think . i want you come live with me in my house with marty and me . in my house , you have your own room . you do not have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here . we will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls . you are dear to me , and you are dear to marty . we are pleased for you to come .
catherine , do not make an opera outta this . the three a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms . you are an old goat , and she has an italian temper . she is a good girl , but you drive her crazy . catherine , you are no fool . you know this is no good , an old woman living with a husband and wife . two women inna same kitchen , anna house burns down .
oh , catherine , please ! do not make a tragedy . you come to my house where you know you be happier yourself .
it pains that they should do this .
i know it pains .
these are the worst years . i tell you . it is gonna happen to you . i am afraida look inna mirror . i am afraid i am gonna see an old lady with white hair , like the old ladies inna park , little bundles inna black shawl , waiting for the coffin . i am fifty six years old . what am i to do with myself ? i have strength in my hands . i wanna cook . i wanna clean . i wanna make dinner for my children . am i an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close ? these are the terrible years , theresa ! terrible years !
catherine , my sister . . .
who ?
marty .
your son marty ?
well , what marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl ?
were the lights on ?
oh sure . this girl is a college graduate .
they are the worst . college girls are one step from the streets . they smoke like men inna saloon . my son joseph , his wife , you know , she types onna typewriter . one step from the streets , i tell you . mrs . pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment .
that is the first time marty ever brought a girl to this house . she seems like a nice girl . i think he has a feeling for this girl . you heard him sing . he been singing like that all morning .
i do not sell this house , i tell you that . this is my husband s house . i had six children in this house .
you will see . a coupla months , you gonna be an old lady , sleeping onna couch in her daughter in law s house .
catherine , you are a blanket of gloom . wherever you are , the rain follows . someday , you gonna smile , and we gonna declare a holiday .
i was up here twice before . once with a friend of mine and once i came up alone . the last time . . . do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there ?
yeah .
well , the last time i was up here , that is where i sat . i sat there for an hour and a half , without moving a muscle . now and then , some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind . i will never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap . then i began to cry , and i had to get up and go home .
i cry a lot too . i am a big cryer .
this is something recent with me , this bursting into tears at the least thing .
oh , i cry all the time , any little thing . my brothers , my brother in laws , they are always telling me what a goodhearted guy i am . well , you do not get goodhearted by accident . you get kicked around long enough , you get to be a real professor of pain . i know exactly how you feel . and i also want you to know i am having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself . so you see , you are not such a dog as you think you are .
i am having a very good time , too .
so there you are . so i guess i am not such a dog as i think i am .
you are a very nice guy , and i do not know why some girl has not grabbed you off long ago .
i do not know either . i think i am a very nice guy . i also think i am a pretty smart guy in my own way .
i am thirty four .
benjamin franklin high school .
benjamin franklin , where is that ? brooklyn ? i went to theodore roosevelt right up here on fordham road . it is right arounna corner from my house . i have a cousin who s a teacher . he teaches latin . he lives in chicago . he was studying to be a jesuit , but he gave it up after his first vows .
thank you .
yes , i know .
i am a catholic , you know , and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin .
yes , i know .
so then mr . gazzara he was a frienda my father he offered me this job in his butcher shop , and everybody pleaded with me to take it . so that is what happened . i did not wanna be a butcher .
there s nothing wrong with being a butcher .
well , i would not call it an elegant profession . it is in a lower social scale . people look down on butchers .
i do not .
it is my feeling that you really want to buy this shop , marty .
that is true . i do . but i am gonna have to take outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars . that is a big note to carry , because i have to give mr . gazzara a mortgage , and what i have to weigh is will it pay off in the end more than i can make onna salary ?
i think anything you want to do , you will do well .
i really should get home . . .
i really should get home , i told my father . . . well , i suppose a little while longer . i wonder if there s any place around here i could put some makeup on . . .
why do not you just move out to portchester ?
well , that is what i was saying . my father is getting old . and we are very close . he is a wonderful man , really . . .
i am afraid of being lonely .
oh , you will not be so lonely . you will make friends right away .
actually , i do not make friends easily .
what are you talking about ? you are a real likeable person . you will make friends out there in portchester one , two , three . you will have people visiting you alla time . i will come visit you . i will borrow my brother freddie s car , or you can call me up when you feel blue , or i will call you up . and it is gonna be nice . do not be so afraid .
yes , i know .
come on inna dining room .
no , thank you . i do not think i should stay very long .
sure . just take off your coat a minute .
oh , i am fine .
you want me to take you home , i will take you home .
maybe that would be a good idea .
i like you . i like you . i been telling you all night , i like you . . .
marty . . .
i just wanna kiss , that is all .
please . . .
no . . .
please . . .
marty . . .
nothing .
i will call you up tomorrow morning . maybe , we will go see a movie .
i would like that very much .
the reason i cannot be definite about it now is my aunt catherine is probably coming over tomorrow , and i may have to help out .
i will wait for your call .
we better get started to your house , because the buses only run about one an hour now .
all right .
nothing .
how do you do ?
we just live one flight up .
so i will call you tomorrow .
okay .
okay .
no , mrs . pilletti . we were just going home . thank you very much anyway .
well , siddown a minute . i just come inna house . i will take off my coat . siddown a minute .
it is a very sad business , i tell you . a woman , fifty six years old , all her life , she had her own home . now she is just an old lady , sleeping on her daughter in law s couch . it is a curse to be a mother , i tell you . your children grow up and then what is left for you to do ? what is a mother s life but her children ? it is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home .
could not she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time ?
hobby ! what can she do ? she cooks and she cleans . you gotta have a house to clean . you gotta have children to cook for . these are the terrible years for a woman , the terrible years .
you must not feel too harshly against her daughter in law . she also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for .
well , i do not know the people , of course , but as a rule , i do not think a mother in law should live with a young couple .
where do you think a mother in law should go ?
i do not think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life .
well , maybe that is what they teach you in new york university . in real life , it do not work out that way . you wait till you are a mother .
it is silly of me to argue about it . i do not know the people involved .
sure .
goodnight .
yeah . i was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl .
i am stag .
well , i will tell you . i got stuck on a blind date with a dog , and i just met an old girl i used to know , and i was wondering how i am gonna get rid of the girl i am with . somebody to take her home , you know what i mean ? i would be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me .
what ?
i will take you over , and i will introduce you as an old army buddy of mine , and then i will cut out . because i got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck , and i will pay you five bucks .
are you kidding ?
no , i am not kidding .
you cannot just walk off onna girl like that .
i came up to dance , wadda you think ? you here with somebody ?
i am just here with another girl .
where you going now ?
i am just gonna get my cigarettes . i left them in my coat .
i will see you around .
i will see you .
well , at the time she told me this , she already had six . every time i saw the woman , she was either . . .
well , i bumped into her on the street , and she was as big as a barrel .
oh , no ! she died right in the hospital . . .
oh , that is a sad story . and her husband is that little fellow , works in peter reeves .
that is the one .
oh , that is a sad story .
boy , that mickey spillane , boy he can write .
boy , that mickey spillane , he sure can write .
that means he would have to marry the girl when she was one year old .
i never thoughta that .
about eight o clock .
sure , what ?
you are the accountant inna family , and i figure you might know about these things . my boss wantsa sell his shop to me . his kids are all married , you know , and he and his wife live alone , and they wanna move out to california where his daughter lives , so he wantsa sell his shop . he wants five thousand dollars down , although i think i can knock him downa four . . .
sure . thanks a lot about my mother . we will work out some arrangement , because naturally i want to pay . . .
do not worry about it .
no , listen , that is my mother , i am gonna pay for her . . .
sure , great if you ai not married .
waddaya talking about , do you know what you are talking about ?
no , i do not know . that is why i am asking you .
well , you see , thomas i figure the big problem is the supermarkets . but patsy s shop , that is a specialized trade . the supermarkets do not carry italian meat .
who buys italian meat anymore ? you think my wife buys italian meat ? she goes to the a p , picks up some lamb chops wrapped in cellophane , opens up a canna peas , and that is dinner , boy .
marty , see that my mother is nice and comfortable , eh ?
sure . this girl said . . .
what girl , what does she know ? why do not you let her hold the baby once in a while ? ! your mother , boy , she wantsa take the kid for a day , that is fine !

marty , thomas and virginia are here . they had another fight with your aunt catherine . so they ask me , would it be all right if catherine come to live with us . so i said , all right with me , but we have to ask you . marty , she is a lonely old lady . nobody wants her . everybody s throwing her outta their house . . .

sooner or later , there comes a point in a mangs life when he gotta face some facts , and one fact i gotta face is that whatever it is that women like , i ai not got it . i chased enough girls in my life . i went to enough dances . i got hurt enough . i do not wanna get hurt no more . i just called a girl just now , and i got a real brush off , boy . i figured i was past the point of being hurt , but that hurt . some stupid woman who i did not even wanna call up . she gave me the brush . i do not wanna go to the stardust ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like i was a bug . i got feelings , you know . i had enough pain . no , thank you .

you should be ashamed of yourself .
she is right . she is right . young husband and wife , they should have their own home . and my sister catherine , she is my sister , but i gotta admit , she is an old goat . and plenty a times in my life , i feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself . and i tell you now , as far as i am concerned , if catherine wantsa come live here with me and marty , it is all right with me .

well , there s the stardust ballroom . that is a kind of a big dance hall . every saturday night , it is just loaded with girls . it is a nice place to go . you pay seventy seven cents . it used to be seventy seven cents . it must be about a buck and half now . and you go in and you ask some girl to dance . that is how i met virginia . nice , respectable place to meet girls . you tell marty , aunt theresa , you tell him , go to the stardust ballroom . it is loaded with tomatoes .
the stardust ballroom . it is loaded with tomatoes .
right .
oh , marty , thanks a lot . that really takes a load offa my mind .
siddown , thomas , siddown .
hello , thomas .
i just this minute got the baby to sleep .
do not worry . i am gonna take care a the whole thing .
hey , why do not you go to the movie ? your mother and me , we are gonna be baby sitter .
hello , thomas , how do you feel ?
ah , my mother , she drives me crazy . i hadda beg her to let me drive her over here . the martyr . she always gotta be the big martyr .
so what happened , aunt theresa , about the milk bottle was my mother in law , she comes inna kitchen , aunt theresa , and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there , so then she begins telling me how i waste money and how i cannot cook , and how i am raising my baby all wrong , so she got me so nervous , i spilled some milk i was making for the baby . . .
she was here , you know , wednesday , and i said , catherine , my sister . . .
so she say , you are spilling the milk . so she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk i spilled , so she got me so mad , so i said , mama , you wanna see me really spill some milk ? so i took the bottle , and i threw it against the door . i did not throw it at her . that is just something she made up . she goes around telling everybody i threw the bottla milk at her . i did not throw it anywheres near her . well , i was sorry right away , you know , but she ran outta the house .
well , i do not know what you want me to do , virginia . if you want me , i will go talk to her tonight .
aunt theresa , you got this big house here . i mean , you got this big house just for you and marty . and i thought maybe tommy s mother could come here and live with you and marty .
well . . .
because i called up tommy s brother joe , and i said , joe , she is driving me crazy . why do not you take her for a couple of years ? and he said , oh no ! i know i sound like a terrible woman . . .
no , virginia , i know how you feel .
i just cannot stand it any more ! every minute of the day ! do this ! do that ! i do not have ten minutes privacy with my husband ! we cannot even have a fight ! we do not have no privacy ! everybody s miserable in our house !
that is all right , that is all right . . .
on accounta . . .
i am gonna see you tonight . . .
i think it be a better idea if you and thomas go out , because otherwise she is gonna start a fight with you , and everybody s gonna be yelling .
sure , sure .
lemme tell it , tommy .
okay .
we want you to do a very big favor for us , aunt theresa .
how is marty been lately , aunt theresa ?
tommy , i promised the babysitter six o clock .
i will see you at mass tomorrow . we will sit down and we will discuss the whole thing .
all right , ginnie . i do not wanna talk anymore about it . i do not think i got one hour s sleep the whole night . last night was the first time in my life i ever heard my mother cry , you know that ?
tommy . . .
i do not wanna talk about it !
why do you always put me inna position of being the louse ?
virginia , i do not wanna hear no more about it !
i do not wanna hear anymore about it , you hear me ?
oh shaddup , will you do me a favor ?
waddaya talking about ? ! !
once a month you could not let her use the kitchen !
i told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted . . .
. . . you hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time !
she do not wanna use my pots and pans !
i do not care about the intention . i just know your cross action is a plus on our side . i have seen it come through four times .
well , sure , but i am also worried about walt waldowski painless . his poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling , and he said what difference did it make , it was just a card game .
you talked to walt ?
he is parted his moorings .
put in one of your fixes . walt knows he is loused himself with the church , but it is part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom . which he will think if you grease the skids for him .
i do not think i can give absolution to a man who s about to commit suicide . it is a mortal sin .
what is , red , the intention or the act ?
i believe it takes both . i would have to look it up .
just use common sense . your job is preventing sin , and the way to do that is give him your best cross action .
he will live if that is what you mean . but somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there s nothing left between his legs .
did not recognize you , red . when you get the clamp all the way down , open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery .
do not you know the first thing you are supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders ?
reckon so , but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite .
you are welcome to one of these , whatever they are .
they give you copies to burn .
never this close .
they have hit us on cherry hill . i just got word . we have our slack periods but when the action starts , you will have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week .
just one for a start .
i have been in this army a long time . i know just what you guys are up to . but there are limits . . .
