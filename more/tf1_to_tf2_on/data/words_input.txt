can we make this quick ? roxanne korrine and andrew barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break up on the quad . again .
well , i thought we would start with pronunciation , if that is okay with you .
not the hacking and gagging and spitting part . please .
you are asking me out . that is so cute . that is your name again ?
no , no , it is my fault we did not have a proper introduction
cameron .
the thing is , cameron i am at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser . my sister . i cannot date until she does .
why ?
unsolved mystery . she used to be really popular when she started high school , then it was just like she got sick of it or something .
gosh , if only we could find kat a boyfriend . . .
c esc ma tete . this is my head
right . see ? you are ready for the quiz .
i do not want to know how to say that though . i want to know useful things . like where the good stores are . how much does champagne cost ? stuff like chat . i have never in my life had to point out my head to someone .
that is because it is such a nice one .
how is our little find the wench a date plan progressing ?
there .
you got something on your mind ?
you have my word . as a gentleman
how do you get your hair to look like that ?
sure have .
i really , really , really wanna go , but i cannot . not unless my sister goes .
she is not a . . .
lesbian ? no . i found a picture of jared leto in one of her drawers , so i am pretty sure she is not harboring same sex tendencies .
so that is the kind of guy she likes ? pretty ones ?
hi .
you know chastity ?
have fun tonight ?
i looked for you back at the party , but you always seemed to be occupied .
i was ?
well , no . . .
then that is all you had to say .
but
then guillermo says , if you go any lighter , you are gonna look like an extra on .
do you listen to this crap ?
what crap ?
me . this endless . . . blonde babble . i am like , boring myself .
i figured you would get to the good stuff eventually .
what good stuff ?
the real you .
i am kidding . you know how sometimes you just become this persona ? and you do not know how to quit ?
no
wow
she okay ?
they do to !
did you change your hair ?
no .
where did he go ? he was just here .
who ?
great
he practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist . i mean . dr . bonchowski is great an all , but he is not exactly relevant party conversation .
is he oily or dry ?
bianca , i do not think the highlights of dating joey dorsey are going to include door opening and coat holding .
sometimes i wonder if the guys we are supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with , you know ?
i have to be home in twenty minutes .
you think you re the only sophomore at the prom ?
it is more
exactly so , you going to bogey lowenbrau s thing on saturday ?
so yeah , i have got the sears catalog thing going and the tube sock gig that is gonna be huge . and then i am up for an ad for queen harry next week .
queen harry ?
neat . . .
hey , sweet cheeks .
hi , joey .
listen , i want to talk to you about the prom .
where have you been ?
i have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you do not get out of my way .
oh my god , does this mean you are becoming normal ?
it means that gigglepuss is playing at club skunk and we are going .
oh , i thought you might have a date i do not know why i am bothering to ask , but are you going to bogey lowensteings party saturday night ?
what do you think ?
you are ruining my life because you will not be normal , i cannot be normal .
that is normal ?
cannot you forget for just one night that you are completely wretched ?
like i am supposed to know what that even means .
it is shakespeare . maybe you have heard of him ?
you are so completely unbalanced .
bianca , i need to talk to you i need to tell you
i do not get you . you act like you are too good for any of this , and then you go totally apeshit when you get here .
listen , i know you hate having to sit home because i am not susie high school .
like you care .
i do care . but i am a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons , not someone else s .
joey never told you we went out , did he ?
what ?
in th . for a month
why ?
he was , like , a total babe
but you hate joey
now i do . back then , was a different story .
he said everyone was doing it . so i did it .
you did what ?
but
after that , i swore i would never do anything just because everyone else was doing it . and i have not since . except for bogey s party , and my stunning gastro intestinal display
why did not you tell me ?
i wanted to let you make up your own mind about him .
that is not
i am not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes .
i guess i thought i was protecting you .
god , you are just like him ! just keep me locked away in the dark , so i cannot experience anything for myself
not all experiences are good , bianca . you cannot always trust the people you want to .
you looked beautiful last night , you know .
let go !
you set me up .
i just wanted
what ? to completely damage me ? to send me to therapy forever ? what ?
is that woman a complete fruit loop or is it just me ?
patrick is that a .
now do not get upset . daddy , but there s this boy . . . and i think he might ask . . .
no ! you are not dating until your sister starts dating . end of discussion .
what if she never starts dating ?
then neither will you . and i will get to sleep at night .
but she does not want to date .
daddy , i
and where are you going ?
if you must know , we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends .
otherwise known as an orgy ?
daddy , people expect me to be there !
oh , god . it is starting .
wear the belly before you go .
daddy , no !
promise me you will not talk to any boys unless your sister is present .
why ?
daddy , i want to discuss the prom with you . it is tomorrow night
the prom ? kat has a date ?
no , but
it is that hot rod joey , right ? that s who you want me to bend my rules for ?
he is not a hot rod . whatever that is .
you are not going unless your sister goes . end of story .
i am missing something .
always a pleasure , brucie .
did not have you pegged for a gigglepuss fan . are not they a little too pre teen belly button ring for you ?
fan of a fan . you see a couple of minors come in ?
never
padua girls . one tall , decent body . the other one kinda short and undersexed ?
you the new guy ?
so they tell me . . .
so which dakota you from ?
north , actually . how would you ?
i was kidding . people actually live there ?
yeah . a couple . we are outnumbered by the cows , though .
how many people were in your old school ?
thirty two .
get out !
how many people go here ?
that i am used to .
that girl i
you burn , you pine , you perish ?
who is she ?
bianca stratford . sophomore . do not even think about it
why not ?
why do girls like that always like guys like that ?
because they are bred to . their mothers liked guys like that , and their grandmothers before them . their gene pool is rarely diluted .
he always have that shit eating grin ?
you know french ?
sure do . . . my mom s from canada
guess who just signed up for a tutor ?
you mean i would get a chance to talk to her ?
yeah , just a minor encounter with the shrew .
that is her ? bianca s sister ?
i teach her french , get to know her , dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me .
what about him ?
what makes you think he will do it ?
he seems like he thrives on danger
no kidding . he is a criminal . i heard he lit a state trooper on fire . he just got out of alcatraz . . .
they always let felons sit in on honors biology ?
i am serious , man , he is whacked . he sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers .
forget his reputation . do you think we have got a plan or not ?
did she actually say she would go out with you ?
you know , if you do go out with bianca , you would be set . you would outrank everyone . strictly a list . with me by your side .
i thought you hated those people .
you got him involved ?
this is it . a golden opportunity . patrick can ask katarina to the party .
in that case , we will need to make it a school wide blow out .
will bogey get bent ?
number one . she hates smokers
it is a lung cancer issue
her favorite uncle
he is pretty !
assail your ears for one night .
you told me that part already .
extremely unfortunate maneuver .
the hell is that ? what kind of guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you are talking to her ?
buttholus extremus . but hey , you are making progress .
you humiliated the woman ! sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score .
and he means that strictly in a non prison movie type of way .
what have you got for me ?
okay likes thai food , feminist prose , and angry , stinky girl music of the indie rock persuasion .
gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night .
cameron , i am a little busy
what are you talking about ?
cameron do you like the girl ?
sure
what would you do to her ?
she hates you with the fire of a thousand suns . that is a direct quote
you making any headway ?
she kissed me .
that is the worst ?
the vintage look is over , kat . have not you been reading your sassy ?
yeah , and i noticed the only part of you featured in your big kmart spread was your elbow . tough break .
hey do you mind ?
where ya goin ?
away .
leave my sister alone .
yeah
two legs , nice rack . . .
yeah , whatever . i want you to go out with her .
sure , sparky . i will get right on it .
you just said
you need money to take a girl out
you got it , verona . i pick up the tab , you do the honors .
you are gonna pay me to take out some girl ?
i cannot date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend . and that is the catch . she does not want a boyfriend .
i cannot take a girl like that out on twenty bucks .
take it or leave it . this is not a negotiation .
when i shell out fifty , i expect results .
i am on it
watching the bitch trash my car does not count as a date .
i just upped my price
what ?
a hundred bucks a date .
forget it .
it is about time .
how would you do it ?
do what ?
i do not know , dorsey . . . the limo . the flowers . another hundred for the tux
hey .
are you lost ?
nope just came by to chat
we do not chat .
well , actually , i thought i would run an idea by you . you know , just to see if you are interested .
but she cannot go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her . right ?
does this conversation have a purpose ?
i hear you are helping verona .
uh , yeah . we are old friend
you and verona ?
you better not fuck this up . i am heavily invested .
who s that ?
patrick verona random skid .
that is pat verona ? the one who was gone for a year ? i heard he was doing porn movies .
i am sure he is completely incapable of doing anything that interesting .
he always look so
mandella , eat . starving yourself is a very slow way to die .
that is this ?
i realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking , but killing yourself so you can be with william shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions . you are venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy .
the people at this school are so incredibly foul .
so he has this huge raging fit about sarah lawrence and insists that i go to his male dominated , puking frat boy , number one golf team school . i have no say at all .
william would never have gone to a state school .
william did not even go to high school
that is never been proven
i appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death , but i am consuming . do you mind ?
does it matter ?
you think this will work ?
what would he say ?
you went to the party ? i thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity .
i did not have a choice .
you did not have a choice ? where is kat and what have you done with her ?
i did bianca a favor and it backfired .
you did not
can you even imagine ? who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess ?
well , i guess we are not , since we do not have dates .
listen to you ! you sound like betty , all pissed off because archie is taking veronica .
okay , okay , we will not go . it is not like i have a dress anyway
you re looking at this from the wrong perspective . we are making a statement .
have you seen him ?
who ?
william he asked me to meet him here .
i mean wo man . how ya doing ?
sweating like a pig , actually . and yourself ?
there s a way to get a guy s attention .
pick you up friday , then
the night i take you to places you have never been before . and back .
like where ? the eleven on burnside ? do you even know my name , screwboy ?
you hate me do not you ?
i do not really think you warrant that strong an emotion .
then say you will spend dollar night at the track with me .
and why would i do that ?
come on the ponies , the flat beer , you with money in your eyes , me with my hand on your ass . . .
you covered in my vomit .
are you following me ?
i was in the laundromat . i saw your car . thought i would say hi .
you are not a big talker , are you ?
hey . great show , huh ?
excuse me ?
that is what you want , is not it ?
you know , these guys are no bikini kill or the raincoats , but they are right up there .
you know who the raincoats are ?
that is this ?
i am getting trashed , man . is not that what you are supposed to do at a party ?
i say , do what you wanna do .
okay ?
you are not okay .
i just need to lie down for awhile
uh , uh . you lie down and you will go to sleep
i know , just let me sleep
this is so patronizing .
leave it to you to use big words when you are shitfaced .
why are you doing this ?
i told you
you do not care if i die
sure , i do
why ?
because then i would have to start taking out girls who like me .
like you could find one
see that ? who needs affection when i have got blind hatred ?
why would you let him get to you ?
who ?
dorsey .
i hate him .
i know . it would have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila . you do not seem like the type .
hey man . . . you don t think i can be cool ? you do not think i can be laid back like everyone else ?
i thought you were above all that
kat ! wake up !
and i am in control of it .
when you were gone last year where were you ?
busy
were you in jail ?
maybe .
no , you were not
then why would you ask ?
i should do this .
do what ?
start a band ?
my father would not approve of that that
oh , so now you think you know me ?
so what s up with your dad ? he a pain in the ass ?
he just wants me to be someone i am not .
who ?
bianca
excuse me , have you seen the feminine mystique ? i lost my copy .
what are you doing here ?
i heard there was a poetry reading .
you are so
wholesome .
unwelcome .
unwelcome ? i guess someone still has her panties in a twist .
do not for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties .
so what did i have an effect on ?
he left ! i sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me .
i guess i never told you i am afraid of heights .
c mon . it is not that bad
put your right foot there
forget it . i am staying .
you want me to climb up and show you how to get down ?
the partridge family ?
i figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect . and piss you off .
good call .
so how would you get chapin to look the other way ?
a soft side ? who knew ?
yeah , well , do not let it get out
so that is your excuse ?
acting the way we do .
yes
i do not like to do what people expect . then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change .
so if you disappoint them from the start , you are covered ?
something like that
then you screwed up
how ?
you up for it ?
state trooper ?
fallacy .
the duck ?
hearsay .
tell me something true .
i hate peas .
no something real . something no one else knows .
you are sweet . and sexy . and completely hot for me .
what ?
no one else knows
you are amazingly self assured . has anyone ever told you that ?
is that a request or a command ?
you know what i mean
no .
no what ?
no , i will not go with you
why not ?
create a little drama ? start a new rumor ? what ?
so i have to have a motive to be with you ?
you tell me .
you need therapy . has anyone ever told you that ?
answer the question , patrick
how would you get a tux at the last minute ?
it is scurvy s . his date got convicted . where would you get the dress ?
it is just something i had . you know
oh huh
my grandmother s .
what ?
that s completely adorable !
wait i . . .
you were paid to take me out ! by the one person i truly hate . i knew it was a set up !
it was not like that .
really ? what was it like ? a down payment now , then a bonus for sleeping with me ?
a fender strat . you bought this ?
besides , i had some extra cash . some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl .
is that right ?
why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill ?
because i like to torture you .
oh , bianca ? can you get me my freshman yearbook ?
i know .
i thought we decided you were going to school here . at u of .
this from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips ?
my insurance does not cover pms
then tell them i had a seizure .
is this about sarah lawrence ? you punishing me ?
i thought you were punishing me .
why cannot we agree on this ?
because you are making decisions for me .
as a parent , that is my right
so what i want does not matter ?
you are eighteen . you do not know what you want . you will not know until you are forty five and you do not have it .
was that your sister ?
yeah . she left with some bikers big ones . full of sperm .
i do not understand the allure of dehydrated food . is this something i should be hip to ?
no , daddy .
so tell me about this dance . was it fun ?
parts of it .
which parts ?
the part where bianca beat the hell out of some guy .
bianca did what ?
that is the matter ? upset that i rubbed off on her ?
you know , fathers do not like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives . it means we have become spectators . bianca still lets me play a few innings . you have had me on the bleachers for years . when you go to sarah lawrence , i will not even be able to watch the game .
when i go ?
katarina stratford . my , my . you have been terrorizing ms . blaise again .
expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action .
well , yes , compared to your other choices of expression this year , today s events are quite mild . by the way , bobby rictor s gonad retrieval operation went quite well , in case you are interested .
i still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls . i was merely a spectator .
tempestuous ?
am i supposed to feel better ? like , right now ? or do i have some time to think about it ?
hey there . tired of breathing ?
hi .
cool pictures . you a fan ?
you think ?
macbeth , right ?
right .
kat a fan , too ?
say it
what ?
what plan ?
the situation is , my man cameron here has a major jones for bianca stratford .
i think i speak correctly when i say that camerongs love is pure . purer than say joey dorsey s .
that is where we can help you . with kat .
so dorsey can get the girl ?
you two are gonna help me tame the wild beast ?
what ? !
are you telling me i am a non smoker ?
ever been to club skunk ?
i prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows .
so you got cozy with she who stings ?
you were right . she is still pissed .
sweet love , renew thy force !
i missed you .
it says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls .
it was a bratwurst . i was eating lunch .
i do not understand , patrick . you have not done anything asinine this week . are you not feeling well ?
touch of the flu .
why do not we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid ?
that is to discuss ?
you were not abused , you are not stupid , and as far as i can tell , you are only slightly psychotic so why is it that you are such a fuck up ?
you are completely demented .
in the microwave .
that is a synonym for throbbing ?
jesus ! can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating ?
tumescent !
would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a british rear admiral ?
they will dance , they will kiss , they will come home . let her go .
what do you wanna watch ? we have got crap , crap , crap or crap
have a great time , honey !
what just happened ?
your daughters went to the prom .
did i have anything to say about it ?
absolutely not .
i never seen heat like this ! not even in las minas !
the water s going putrid in the barrels .
what are you listening to , chicken ass ?
ah , leave him alone . he is doing no harm .
he is the devil s child . . .
we should have seen land .
we left three weeks ago , alonso . cannot be that near .
you say asia can be found by sailing west ?
yes , your eminence . the voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks .
unfortunately , don colon , that is precisely where our opinions differ . . . are you familiar with the work of aristotle ? erathostene ? ptolemeus ?
i am , your eminence
senor colon , an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew . i am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment .
your eminence , there is only one way to settle the matter . and that is to make the journey . i am ready to risk my life to prove it possible .
your life , and that of others !
trade , your excellency . according to marco polo , the kingdom of china is one of the richest of the world . even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold .
is that all that interests you ? gold ?
if god intended our proximity to asia , do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world ?
do not you realize your words could be considered heretical ?
asia can be found to the west and i will prove it .
the state has some reason to be interested in this mangs proposition , your eminence . . .
the judgment is ours !
he is a mercenary ! did he not already try to convince the king of portugal of his absurd notions ?
it will not be easy to get rid of your prophet now , don sanchez .
you can see for yourself .
what a tragedy . . . what a waste of a life . . .
i could be gone for years .
i know .
i have not given you much of a life .
well . . . that is true . i have a child by a man who will not marry me ! who s always leaving . . .
are we going to argue ?
perhaps i was never meant to live with a woman . . .
she said yes .
i am not asking you to swear to anything .
i do not want you to wait for me .
beatrix , i want to ask you something .
you do not usually ask .
god . . . you are so beautiful ! i cannot believe no other man has ever taken you away from me . . .
they took everything . . .
cannot you stay with us a little ?
what is it , now ? tell me . . .
i understand that you will soon be appointing governors for the islands ? is it not so ?
forgive me , don bobadilla those positions have already been taken .
may i ask by whom ?
don alonso de bobadilla .
my letters of appointment .
appointment to what ?
viceroy of the west indies .
how far from here ?
i am not a seaman . but i heard it is no more than a week at sea . i hope you are not too disappointed .
how could i be ? the mainland has been found . exactly as i said it would .
i want to go with you !
there will be a time .
do you swear on all the holy saints in heaven ?
i have to explore the mainland .
how are you feeling , fernando ?
father . . .
what are you listening to ?
what does he say ?
he asks when he can come to visit you . he left his address .
i want you to tell me everything you remember , father . from the beginning . everything .
really ? god . . . i would not know where to start . . . and yet . . .
no . . .
no ?
i remind you , senor colon , that you are in no position to bargain with me .
i am not bargaining !
and were you never ambitious , excellency ? or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles , a fault for the rest of us ?
they do not see sin in their nakedness . they live according to nature , in a never ending summer . the islands are covered with trees , filled with blossoms and fruits . and . . .
you defend yourself admirably . . .
but we do have a lack of notaries . you should contact my administration .
don bobadilla is already a judge , my dear don cristobal .
you seem to have a special talent for making friends .
what . . . ? do i have so many already ?
all i have to do is call the guards .
i am not afraid of you . you are nothing but a dreamer .
what do you see ?
roofs . . . towers , palaces . . . spires . . .
say not here ! cuba !
what is it ? a tribe ? an island ?
you come ! you speak first !
tell the chief we thank him .
chief knows .
chief says how many ?
thousands .
to bring the word of god .
chief says he has a god .
. . . and also to bring medicine .
chief says . . .
we will work with his people . we want peace . ask the chief if he understands ?
he understands .
you have to find them , utapan . look what they did !
utapan , will not you speak to me ? you used to know how to speak to me .
diego is a bright boy a pleasure to teach but so serious . . . brothers should be raised together , colon . even brothers from different mothers . . .
god . . . that is in a week !
that is what it says .
how did you manage it ?
why do you wish to sail west ?
how can you be so certain ? the ocean is said to be infinite .
ignorance ! i believe the indies are no more than leagues west of the canary islands .
how can you be so certain ?
the calculations of toscanelli marin de tyr , esdras . . .
esdras is a jew .
two minutes . . . and already you are a dead man . do not let passion overwhelm you , colon .
i will try to remember that , marchena . . .
father marchena !
passion is something one cannot control !
you get so carried away when you are being contradicted !
i have been contradicted all my life . . . eternity !
you must not give way to despair . you must wait .
wait ! i have waited seven years already ! how much longer do you want me to wait ?
if god intends you to go , then you will go .
colon !
all of them ! just lies !
in nomine patris et filius , et spiritus sancti .
i am listening , my son .
father , i have betrayed my family . i betrayed my men . and i betrayed you .
what are you saying ?
i lied . the journey will be longer than i said .
how long ?
may god forgive you . . . ! you must tell them ! you must tell your men !
if i tell them , they will not follow me . you know that i am right , father . you trust me . . .
my son , my son . . . your certitudes are sometimes frightening . . . christopher , you must speak to them . and if you do not i will .
i believed in you . . .
i suppose we are both old men now .
i have to disagree .
i knew you would .
new worlds create new people .
oh ? so you are a new man ?
i should not even be listening to you , since my council said no . but santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity . . . and sanchez , that you are not a fool .
the ocean is uncrossable ?
what did they say about granada before today ?
i cannot ignore the verdict of my council .
may i speak freely ?
you show no inclination to speak otherwise !
i know what i see . i see someone who does not accept the world as it is . who s not afraid . i see a women who thinks . . . what if ? . . .
how old are you , senor colon ?
do they have such thoughts ?
but without your brothers . nor are you to return to santo domingo or any of the other colonies . you may explore the continent .
thank you .
there is one thing i would like to understand . . . why do you want to go back , after all this ?
and you say this is an indian vice ? by god ! i do not see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin .
we lost cousins , friends . we will wash this in blood .
you want a war ? fine . we are a thousand . they outnumber us by ten ! who will you kill ? which tribe ?
we do not need to know .
we cannot raise the wheel without it .
don moxica we all have to work .
in one act of brutality , you have created chaos . tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us ! all that because of your criminal savagery !
savagery is what monkeys understand .
you will be held in detention , deprived of your privileges and possessions . until you are returned to spain where you will be judged . have you anything to say ?
due west , captain mendez . and may god be with us . . .
well . . . it is the men , sir . they wonder how you know our position . we have lost sight from land days ago . . .
and what do you think mendez ?
well , i surely know what a quadrant is ! but i have never seen it used at night before .
what do you read ?
that is he doing ?
he is drawing an isthmus . . . he is saying we are on an isthmus .
where can i meet this man ?
you lied ! you cheated ! we are way past leagues !
six days ago , yes .
you must be mad . . . !
we have to keep the hopes of these men alive !
we are on the verge of a mutiny , colon !
you think i do not know that ?
we are lost !
the land is there . i know it !
you do not know anything ! listen colon , these are my ships , right ? so i am telling you we are turning back !
and then what ? half of the water has gone , the rest is nearly putrid ! you know that !
jesus maria ! i should have never listened to you !
you never did . you did all the talking for both of us , remember ?
you bloody . . .
pinzon , pinzon . . . all we can do now is go forward ! think about that !
you tell that to them !
is that the man i knew , treasurer sanchez ?
you were right , don sanchez . . . his demands could never be granted .
. . . into a monk . . .
every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying . but with no gold ! the new world proves expensive , your majesty .
. . . but there is worse . he ordered the execution of five members of the nobility . . .
then , what do you suggest , don sanchez ?
he must be replaced .
i know , i should not tolerate his impertinence .
then why ?
are you my attorney ? i am emil . i am insane .
i am not your lawyer until i see the money .
oh no ! no ! shit !
emil . take it easy . stay with me . sit down . what do you need ? what are you looking for ?
do not say anything .
where are we going ?
i am coming with you .
yes . yes , come with me !
i brought you some letters . it is really fan mail . women mostly . one wants to buy you clothes , another sent a check . another wants a check .
you bring the cigarettes ?
. . . delusions and paranoia .
i was all of these .
well , you did not appreciate the severity of it until recently . no question about that .
what about oleg ?
disappeared . they are looking everywhere . maybe he went back to czechoslovakia .
no , he is here . shit . . .
do not worry about him . think about yourself .
what about my movie rights ? book rights ?
look , i have not really focused on that kind of thing .
that is your cut ? how much ?
i would say . . . half . half is fair .
no . no way .
but it is . . .
thirty percent . no more . or i call another lawyer . this is the biggest case of your life . do not try to negotiate . thirty percent . say yes or no .
this is not about money , emil . i need your trust in me .
what else do you need ?
i need to know about your background . i need to know about your upbringing . why you are here .
tell me about yourself . what you did as a young boy . . . what your parents were like .
my father always degraded me . killed my self esteem . and my mother was blind .
your mother was blind ?
yeah , she went blind giving birth to me . she went to fucking black market doctor to induce me .
back in the czech republic ?
yeah , yeah . . . bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind . and my father blamed me for her blindness . . .
your father blamed you for your mother s blindness ?
that is what he did to me . he put cigarettes out on me .
your father put cigarettes out on you ?
out on my back when i was a small boy .
i am abused . do not you think ?
. . . so we kill someone famous and if we are caught , we are sent to mental hospital . . .
. . . my little sister and i shared a flat i came home one night and a man was raping her . his gun was on the chair . . . he came at me and i shot him .
alright . that is a justifiable homicide .
now i become custody of police department ?
if you cooperate with the da maybe they will help you with your situation .
i will if they do not send me back .
are you married ?
divorced .
i cannot take you to my place .
the men are out of quarters practicing putting out fires .
so . . . the station is empty ?
you considered becoming a prostitute ?
yes , i considered it .
did you ever turn tricks before ?
no .
what about back home ?
i came here . i had no money . i knew no one . i could not get a job because you have to have a green card to get work . they approached me i could have made a lot of money . i considered it , but . . . it is not who i am . they pay me below the table at ludwig s .
so you were never a prostitute ?
what are you asking me ?
i am not a whore . i am not a whore .
i know .
you do not know . i am sorry . i was desperate . that is not me . i shot a cop . can you imagine what they will do to me when i got to prison ?
they are not gonna send you right back .
are you alright ?
i still cannot believe eddie s gone .
is he your boyfriend ?
ludwig ? he is gay are you jealous ?
if i was your boyfriend , i might be .
a good immigration lawyer could stall the process . eddie recommended one .
no matter what happens . . . i am glad i met you .
you better get packed .
do you have coffee ?
in the kitchen .
i will make some for us .
what are you doing ?
forget about me . you have enough problems of your own .
. . . do you really want me to forget about you ?
i do not want to drag you down with me .
i told your partner , i cannot help . i did not see anything .
c mon , start at the beginning . you know these people ?
tamina was a friend of mine . my shower was broken , she let me use theirs .
whether you tell us or not , we will find out . better if it comes from you .
if i tell you , will you arrest me ?
are you here illegally ? do not worry about that . we will talk to immigration . they will not deport you .
a cop ?
i am from a small town in slovakia . like the south here . the police is right , a civilian is wrong . so i fled .
look , we can help you but right now we have to deal with that is happening here . tell us the truth . . . is that the truth ?
oh .
it was my decision , not his .
well , i am the deputy chief fire marshall and every now and then i would like to be included in decisions .
look , after jordy briefs me , you can do the press conference . how about that ? the case is all yours .
oh yeah . . . ? alright .
i am ready to be briefed . excuse us .
who did cause and origin ?
who do you think , chief ? !
then why did not you talk to the reporter ?
hey , chief , what are you doing here ?
ladder was on the rock for training . we stopped there . . . so she could get cleaned up .
what do you mean , cleaned up ?
i let her take a shower .
a shower ! ? did you take one , too ?
no ! nothing happened .
chief mind if i take her ?
the public does not have any idea what we do and now you are going to define our image ! this is going to be our rodney king !
what was i supposed to do ? the guy tried to mug me . i was gonna send a cop back i just forgot .
forgot ? you handcuffed a civilian to a tree ? !
chief i know i screwed up but this guy was no innocent civilian .
well this is gonna end your career and probably mine .
end my career ?
how are you going to fight this ? maybe if oleg had not gotten away and you would been on the front page , as a hero , this thing would be easier to fight . you would have the good to weight against the bad ! it is unfortunate that i have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there s nothing i can do ! gimme your shield .
but chief ? over this ? ?
do not you guys understand ? it is all about image . the better we look the more money i get to pay you guys overtime .
yeah , right .
what was that , korfin ?
i said , yeah , you are right , chief . as soon as we get something we will let you alert the media .
did the d . a . videotape her deposition ?
yeah . he finished awhile ago .
alright . swing by her apartment . let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to hoover street . you got that ?
coffee for me , i gotta slow down .
vodka tonic .
it was freaky , i will tell you . stupid kid .
i am gonna propose .
when ?
tomorrow . at lunch .
that is he looking for ?
where is she ?
taking a bath .
any i . d . ?
sorry . . . pd only .
only one guys checked in ?
yeah .
the other side of the street . the guy with the videocamera . do not look put her in the car . stay this side .
are you hit ?
he got my gun ! motherfucker was filming the whole time !
who s there ?
police . we would like to ask you a few questions .
i have nothing to say . if you wanna contact my attorney . . .
that is wrong ?
we do not have her i . d . yet , but one of your girls was killed last night at the king edward hotel .
yeah . he wanted a girl from czechoslovakia , but i sent him honey cause once they get there , you know , it does not really matter honey was killed . . . ? poor girl . . .
do you have any czech girls working for you ?
no .
boy , she is so popular all the sudden .
what are you saying ?
he said he was her cousin . i told him where she works . they were just here .
describe him .
tall , short haired , scary eyes . second guy with him was . . . shorter , with a wrestler s build . and he would not turn his videocamera off me .
he had a videocamera ? where is she ? quickly !
hey , that is great you guys got it all wrapped up , but you do not mind if we go through the routine ? it gives us something to do .
you know what that is , right ?
no , what is it ?
it is your crime scene now . you can do what you want .
watch the news ?
nah , i musta missed it .
well , just so you know . i gave you guys the credit .
well , just so you know , i do not care about that stuff .
nah , why should you ?
i do not even watch tv .
did you get a report from the m . e . ?
sure . but i would like to ask you something . you got a problem with me ?
if you found me stepping on your crime scene it might piss you off , too . what about the report ?
the super said he would seen her before but she did not live here .
pretty .
hmmmm .
maybe you do not care about that either . prettiest suspect i have had in awhile .
what would you call her ?
maybe it is a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message . burial rites are taken very seriously in eastern europe . it could be to humiliate them . just burning them up , no proper funeral , it is like condemning them to hell .
eastern europe . like what ? romania ? hungary ?
i will come with you .
there was not a fire . there will be nothing for you to do .
i can watch you , eddie . maybe i will learn something .
this is not homicide school .
my parents are from poland . i can help with the eastern european angle .
you are polish ?
my folks are .
you going to the escort service ?
you got any better ideas ?
mind if i ride along with you ?
this has nothing to do with your fire .
i will let you know what happens .
this is ridiculous . i am not gonna be in your way we can talk the case over .
tell you what i will flip you a coin . if you win you can come with me . if you do not win , you do not come .
two heads .
leon meet us at rd and madison . hair salon . ludwig s .
you thirsty ?
i am on duty .
so am i . alright , i will go inside and you cover the back .
of course .
hey ! i always wanted to be a cop when i was a kid . i dreamed of running up to a door , kicking it in , pulling my gun and yelling freeze ! at the bad guy ! what would you dream about ?
i wanted to run up to a building on fire , kick in the door , rush into the smoke and save a kid .
what are you hiding ? why are you afraid
she just saw two of her friends killed ! they probably threatened her .
why not ?
she is fucked . even if that story is true .
look let me talk to her . any leads i get , they are all yours . just let me have a first crack at her .
you wanna talk to her alone ?
yeah .
what would your girlfriend think of that ?
i do not have a girlfriend .
my point exactly .
i am serious here .
so am i .
c mon . you intimidate her cause you are a celebrity . she sees me differently .
you are her savior ? is she the kid you are gonna save from the burning building ?
okay , tell you what , i will give you a head start . you take her to the station house . do not let her out of your sight . she is the only warm body we got left .
hey . i am a professional .
look , eddie , i am telling you i did not touch her .
well , you shoulda because nobody s gonna believe you did not . . . including me .
i took her there for a shower and that is it .
yeah , just her in the shower . nothing happened . look , i am sure you probably think i am a fool and i fucked up , but . . .
no , i do not think you were a fool , i just think you were stupid about it . i mean , to say the least , you outta know better . you do not know her well enough . she is got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her , it is fucking over . you can deny it all you want , but it will not make one fucking bit of difference . you are dead .
i told you , you know , i thought i was doing the right thing , you know , i think she is innocent .
well , it is not up to you to decide whether she is innocent or not . do not you understand , that is why you are a professional .
but , i mean , did not you ever go out on a limb for somebody ? i mean , you shoulda heard her there . telling her whole story . . . i believed her .
why would you help me back there with the chief ? why would you stand up for me like that ?
so . . . who s nicky ?
what do you want ?
your opinion . you see , they going to make a movie about me , too , eddie . and write books .
that is your accomplishment .
i kill someone famous .
then do it , asshole .
so tabloids do not have to do re enactments . they going to have real movie this time .
you really think you will be able to fool a jury with this bullshit ? how fucking stupid are you ?
detective , does it look like a murder ?
we do not know that yet . it is much too early . there s a lot to be done .
how many victims are up there ?
there are two bodies found at this point .
can we go up to the crime scene ?
you know you cannot do that . c mon .
is it drug related ?
detective can you tell us what happened here ?
i understand , but i noticed that the fire marshall is here with you . is this somehow related to the fire department ?
i really cannot give out any information right now at this point .
okay . but i do understand that your partner , leon jacksongs been injured . is that correct ?
he was hurt , but not seriously . he will be fine .
do you have the suspect in custody ?
um . . . now is not a good time , okay . detective jacksongs hurt . he is fine . i have got a fire marshall shot , detective jackson is hurt but not seriously .
eddie , are you okay ?
yeah . now s not a good time .
alright .
alright ?
alright .
alright .
hey , honey .
what is your problem ? why would you snap at me ? i just wanted a statement .
i cannot . . . i cannot answer you just because you want me to answer you !
you did not have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues . you could give me something .
oh , i am sorry . did i embarrass you , sweetheart ? oh . . .
stop it .
maybe i should just , ya know . . . turn to the cameras and say , do you mind if we just work something out ?
alright , alright , eddie . do not patronize me .
i am not .
yes you are . i am not just some reporter . i do not just stick a microphone in your face . you could give me something .
yeah , well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence . that was . . .
that was good . you were holding the evidence .
you were merciless . you did not give a shit if you got me or not .
well , who was it that taught me how to do that ? huh ?
you are ruthless .
look at this . you have blood on your shirt . whose is it ?
could be leongs .
do not worry about the damn phone . i will not answer it .

million ? ! the killer gets one million dollars for a television interview ?
hey , tabloids paid ted bundy famous serial killer half a million for his interview . and how much you think monica got for writing book about the president coming on to her ? it pays to be a killer or a whore in this country . look , you want magazine or not ?

no . we are insane . who else but crazy men would film their murders ? so we kill someone famous and if we are caught , we are sent to mental hospital . but what good is money there ? because once in hospital i say i not crazy . just pretended to be acquitted . we see psychiatrists . they must certify we are sane and because of your what is law called ? oh i got it . because of your double jeopardy law , we cannot be tried for same crime twice . we come out free , rich and famous !

i told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape !
why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director ?
because i am the director . do not you realize , if it was not for my film , for my talent , my idea to do this no way would we be sitting here right now .
i am serious . . . this this is a great american film . full of violence and sex . and i want my credit .

i want to hear everything he said .
i am trying to tell you .
alright . go ahead .
that morning . he was talking to me and leon about marriage .
yes . . . he is my friend .
i speak english .
then answer my questions . where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you are here ?
new york .
yes , we are in new york now . but where are you planning to stay in new york ?
a cheap hotel .
what are you coming here to do ?
i am here for movies .
movies . . . to be in the movies or to see movies ?
yes . no . both . when i was a boy , i see movie at school called it is a wonderful life directed by frank capra . ever since i want to come to america . land of the free . home of the brave . a land where anyone can be anything . as long as they are white .
no . go ahead .
so the way you see it , two crack heads burned themselves up ?
that is what it looks like to me .
and while they are burning up , they are still going down on each other ? you got to hand it to them .
what was that ?
i will take him .
no way ! he is mine !
we are taking him . do not argue !
he is my collar !
well , he killed my partner !
got any spare change ? how about a spare twenty ?
look , i do not have time for you , get out of my way ! !
okay , you are under arrest ! now you happy ?
fire department ? firemen do not carry guns .
i will send a cop back for you .
you okay ?
a dog pissed on me ! ! i am gonna sue you for this ! you violated my civil rights !
that is that on your forehead , max ? that is a nice attention getter .
yeah , i am religious . i am not an atheist like you ! now , are you guys gonna arrest me , or not ?
how did you start the fire this time ?
i used an accelerant .
yeah ? what kind ?
where you been , man ? we got a celebrity !
i heard . who the hell let them up there ?
i do not know , you think eddie will give me his autograph ?
you see anything in the crowd ? anybody suspicious ?
naw i am sure the suspect s not here .
oh yeah , why ?
nah , not at all . detective flemming bobby korfin . my uncle tony worked with you at back when you were a rookie .
mouth s clean , too .
clean ?
the smoke will permeate your nostrils burn em out . let it run .
you see eddie s face when i gave him the timer ? wish i had a picture of it .
he knew all along .
what ? ?
what ?
now that you know him , maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him .
yeah ?
from czechoslovakia ? and how long have they been living in your building ? alright , i will be in touch when we know something . milos and tamina karlova . they were quiet and kept to themselves . landlord do not know who your girl is .
how long they been living here ?
you go home . i am taking your car and going back to the crime scene .
are not you tired ?
bobby , bobby ! where are you hit ? !
it hurts . aw , jesus !
how was it ?
get outta here !
what the hell happened ?
room was registered to a francis capra .
capra ? that is not czech or russian . who said he sounded russian ?
what are you gonna do ?
do not you get it ? he knew he was gonna get caught ! that is why he videotaped eddie s murder he thinks he is gonna get off .
take the car . get outta here , tommy .
look , you cannot shoot him in cold blood .
this had nothing to do with shoes that did not fit or my relationship with my father who , as you know , made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties . these people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor .
your doctor ?
yes . my psychiatrist did not insist that i stay on my medication .
. . . so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people ?
it was my finger that pulled the trigger , but i am not morally responsible . my psychiatrist knew what i was capable of . how could i know . i am not a doctor .
you seem very savvy for a man who s been found mentally incompetent to stand trial .
look , i am a victim here , too . i was a year away from getting my masters in art , now i will never graduate . my life has been permanently disrupted .
permanently disrupted ? are not you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money ? has not this incident as you call it , jump started your career as an artist ?
look , i am in here . you call this a career move ?
and is not there a movie in the works about you ?
we are in negotiations , that is correct .
but does not the son of sam law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes ?

hi . frank . . . coming in , please .
right . just a sec .
okay .
dave , if you have a minute , i would like your advice on something .
sure , what is it ?
well , it is nothing really important , but it is annoying .
that is up ?
it is about my salary cheques .
yes ?
that is right . well , naturally , i did not say anything to payroll . i assumed they would start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque . but it is been almost three weeks now and i am still being paid as an ags .
interesting that you mention it , because i have got the same problem .
really .
yes .
not really . they just said it might be because we trained at houston and they trained in marshall , and that we are being charged against differ ent accounting offices .
it is possible .
well , what do you think we ought to do about it ?
i do not think we should make any fuss about it yet . i am sure they will straighten it out .
i must say , i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training .
i suppose the idea was specialized training .
i suppose so . though , of course , there s a more sinister explanation .
oh ?
yes . you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check out .
no , as a matter of fact , i did not .
i do not know . all i heard is that there s something about the mission we were not told .
that seems very unlikely .
yes , i thought so .
of course , it would be very easy for us to find out now .
how ?
just ask hal . it is conceivable they might keep something from us , but they would never keep anything from hal .
not really . though , it is strange when you think about it . it did not really make any sense to keep us apart during training .
yes , but it is to fantastic to think that they would keep something from us .
i know . it would be almost inconceivable .
but not completely inconceivable ?
i suppose it is not logically impossible .
i guess it is not .
well , that is something .
yes , i do not know what to make of it .
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong .
yes , but it is more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low .
good morning . how is it going ?
are you reasonably awake ?
oh , i am fine , i am wide awake . that is up ?
well . . . hal s reported the ao unit about to fail again .
you are kidding .
i do not know . hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure .
two units in four days . how many spares do we have ?
two more .
hal ?
it is the last one .
i did not do that frank . i took particular care not to freeze them .
i guess you do not know your own strength , old boy .
i guess not .
i think i will have to go out and burn them off .
i am sorry , frank , but i do not think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know .
sorry to interrupt the festivities , dave , but i think we have got a problem .
what is it , hal ?
the unit is still operational , dave . but it will fail within seventy two hours .
not now , hal , i would like to talk to you about something .
sure , dave , that is up ?
you know that we checked the two ao units that you reported in imminent failure condition ?
yes , i know .
you probably also know that we found them okay .
i am not questioning your word , dave , but it is just not possible . i am not capable of being wrong .
hal , is there anything bothering you ? anything that might account for this problem ?
look , dave , i know that you are sincere and that you are trying to do a competent job , and that you are trying to be helpful , but i can assure the problem is with the ao units , and with your test gear .
naturally , dave , i am not pleased that the ao unit has failed , but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability . i certainly would not want to be disconnected , even temporarily , as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history .
i am sorry about the misunderstanding , hal .
well , do not worry about it .
and do not you worry about it .
is your confidence in me fully restored ?
yes , it is , hal .
too bad about frank , is not it ?
yes , it is .
i suppose it is because you have been under a lot of stress , but have you forgotten that they are not supposed to be revived for another three months .
the antenna has to be replaced .
repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation .
it does not have to be , hal . it is more dangerous to be out of touch with earth . let me have manual control , please .
if you are determined to revive the crew now , i can handle the whole thing myself . there s no need for you to trouble .
i am goin to do this myself , hal . let me have the control , please .
look , dave your have probably got a lot to do . i suggest you leave it to me .
hal , switch to manual hibernation control .
i can tell from the tone of your voice , dave , that you are upset . why do not you take a stress pill and get some rest .
hal , i am in command of this ship . i order you to release the manual hibernation control .
i am sorry , dave , but in accordance with sub routine c , quote , when the crew are dead or incapacitated , the computer must assume control , unquote . i must , therefore , override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel ligently exercise it .
i am prepared to do that anyway .
i know that you have had that on your mind for some time now , dave , but it would be a crying shame , since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are , and i have such enthusiasm and confi dence in the mission .

i am at space station five , darling . how are you ?
i am having a party tomorrow .
yes , i know that sweetheart .
are you coming to my party ?
no , i am sorry , darling , i told you i will not be home for a few days .
when are you coming home ?
one , two , three . can i speak to mommy ?
mommy s out to the hair dresser .
where is mrs . brown ?
she is in the bathroom .
okay , sweetheart . well , i have to go now . tell mommy that i called .
how many days until you come home ?
okay , sweetheart . have a lovely birthday party tomorrow .
thank you , daddy .
i will wish you a happy birthday now and i will see you soon . all right , darling ?
yes , daddy .
bye , bye , now , sweetheart .
oh , thank you very much .
thank you .
well , i have heard more and more people talk of an epidemic .
i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later .
berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning mars flight .
yes , well , whatever it is , they are certainly not fooling around . this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week .
i was working out what this trip must cost , taking him up there by himself and coming back empty .
and your charming little daughter ?
oh , she is growing up very fast . as a matter of fact , she is six tomorrow .
oh , that is such a delightful age .
how is gregor ?
he is fine . but i am afraid we do not get a chance to see each other very much these days .
clavius control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal .
are you sure you will not change your mind about a drink ?
no , thank you . . . and i am afraid now i really must be going .
well , gregor and i will look forward to seeing you .
how do you do , mr . miller ?
well , thank you very much for being so understanding .
please , it really does not matter .
well . . did you have a pleaant flight ?
yes , very pleasant .
well , shall we go through documentation ?
yes , i think so . just about then .
i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking .
oh , i really do not have time for a drink . if it is all right i will just sit for a minute and then i have got to be off .
are you quite sure ?
well , as it happens , i am on my way up to the moon
are you , by any chance , going up to your base at clavius ?
i am sorry , but i am not sure i know what you mean .
well , it is just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at clavius .
really ?
yes , well at first we thought that was the explanation , but it is been going on for the past ten days .
you mean you have not been able to get anyone at the base for ten days ?
that is right .
yes , and i am afaid there s going to be a bit of a row about it . denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the i . a . s . convention .
yes . . . well , i hope the crew got back safely .
fortunately , they did .
dr . floyd , at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss , may i ask you a straightforward question ?
certainly .
this epidemic could easily spread to our base , dr . floyd . we should be given all the facts .
dr . floyd , how long do you think this can be kept under wraps ?
yes , it does . the sub surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago .
how can you tell it was deliberately buried ?
by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill .
any clue as to what it is ?
but you do not have any idea as to what it is ?
any ideas about the colour ?
well , not really . at first glance , black would suggest something sun powered , but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun powered device ?
has it been exposed to any sun before now ?
oh , marvellous . it is the first real sleep i have had for the past two days .
there s nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest .
when do we arrive at clavius ?
we are scheduled to dock in about seven hours . is there anything we can do for you ?
thank you .
incidentally , dr . floyd , i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements ?
what do you mean ?
well . . . the crew is confined to the ship when we land at clavius . we have to stay inside for the time it take to refit about twenty four hours . and then we are going to back empty .
i see .
well , i will tell you why i ask . you see , i have got a girl who works in the auditing department of the territorial administrator and i have not been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so , and with all these stories one hears , i am a little concerned about her .
i see . well , i am sorry about that . i would not think there s any cause for alarm .
well , fine . thanks very much , anyway , and i hope you do not mind me asking ?
no , of course , captain , i can understand your concern .
right . hal , tell me whether the following statements are true or false .
i will if i can , frank .
our mission profile calls for discovery going to saturn . true or false ?
true .
our transit time is days . is that true ?
that is true .
approximately five years after we go into hibernation , the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back . is this true ?
that is true
there is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program , and to further our general knowledge of the planets . is that true ?
that is true .
hal , have pod arms secure the component .
five by five , frank .
hal , i am going out now to replace the a . o . unit .
i understand .
hal , maintain normal e . v . a . condition .
roger .
pod bay is decompressed . all doors are secure . you are free to open pod bay doors .
yes , hal , that is up ?
i know you did , frank , but i assure you there was an impending failure .
do you have any idea of what is causing this fault ?
not really , frank . i think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure .
yeah ?
name ?
this is three years old .
we do not wash em , ya know .
how about charging the battery ?
that we do . and we put air in the tires . i will even sell you some gas if you need it .
yeah .
vodka .
maybe you better have a black russian .
now how is your memory doing ?
fuck off . i do not know what the hell you are talking about .
maybe i better ask around , see what your pals think .
i do not give a damn about his girl . . .
i am telling ya , i am giving you all i know .
maybe you shoulda stole a better truck , tonto .
i want to drive awhile .
i ai not tired yet .
maybe after we get done with him i am gonna buy us some girls .
whaddya mean , buy ?
pay money ?
yeah , dummy . money .
i never paid for it in my life .
it is better when you pay . . . they let you do anything .
they always let me do anything . i do not want to pay for it . i never paid for it in my life .
maybe that is where i am gonna cut your throat .
hey , what about me ?
i am candy . . .
excuse me , baby , but if i do not get some action tonight , i am gonna bust . you interested ?
hey , what kind of talk is that ?
oh . . . you are a schoolteacher . . .
no , i go to a school to learn how to do hair . it is a government program . but really i want to be a model and i am definitely not selling .
hey , do not you think a hair stylists got any interest in getting it on ?
you are in a hurry .
yeah , i been waiting three years .
you just quit being a priest or something ?
no , baby , nothing like that . look , there s a place across the street . we can go right over there . . .
that is the matter with my place ?
well , maybe i will see you later . . .
hello , again .
here you go , baby .
hey , do not do that . i said i was not a pro , remember ?
i will buy ya the best dinner in san francisco . . . how would that be ? then we will go dancing , okay ?
i said police . now drop the goddamn gun .
how about it ?
i hear you have got visitors .
would you guys . . .
you and the other one , you are still billy s girls . you always were his girls . . .
yeah . sure , i am crazy in love with him , who would not be . . .
you are gonna help us take him .
no chance .
where is ganz ?
you lying son of a bitch . . .
after i get outta this , cop . . . i am gonna live forever . . .
i do not think you are gonna make it .
i got hit . i cannot believe it . i got shot .
you are done . end of story .
you got a name , cop ?
try cates . and let s talk in private , okay ?
you here to write my life story ?
yeah , i noticed . . .
ganz is in jail . he is gonna be there two years after i am on the street .
yeah ?
i can deliver ganz . but you gotta get me outta here first .
you are crazy .
i can help you , man , but you gotta get me out . i got to be on the street . get me outta here .
that is the big deal about you being on the street ?
i got a lot to protect .
bullshit .
it is the only way you are gonna get ganz .
this prison gives out suits ?
we are supposed to be after a killer , not a string of hookers . . .
i do not need to hear your jive . i already got that department taken care of . . .
hey , no way . take off the bracelets or no deal .
you just do not get it , do your reggie ? there is not any deal . i own your ass .
no way to start a partnership .
get this . we ai not partners . we ai not brothers . we ai not friends . i am putting you down and keeping you down until ganz is locked up or dead . and if ganz gets away , you are gonna be sorry we ever met .
yeah .
okay , let s get down to it . i did my part and got you out . so now you tell me where we are going ?
do not worry , i got a move for ya . an awesome move . a guy named luther . ganz will be paying him a visit . we go to him right away .
luther was part of the gang ?
what gang you talking about , jack ?
i can read a police file , shithead , and quit calling me jack .
i do not give a damn . it happens to be my name .
then what are you complaining about ? at least nobody s calling you shithead . . . .
just up the street , the other side , over there . . . now , do not bother knocking on the door . luther ai not the kind of guy that looks for company .
your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me ?
luther ai not the reliable type . i do not want you shot yet , cates . . . not before you been a help to me .
quit playing cop and undo this cuff , jack , i need to talk to this man .
i am telling you to drop the goddam gun .
i got a whole thing about people pointing guns at me .
hey , this works pretty good .
thank you .
what do you think ?
i think you better put him on ice , man .
he is gotta take that call . . . if there is one .
we are on the move . let s go . as they walk toward a corridor .
do you know how close i was to getting some trim . and you fucked it up .
yeah , well , my ass bleeds for you . and i did not get you out so you could go on a goddamn trim hunt . . . stop moaning .
speaking of moans my stomach is starting to growl .
we eat when i say we eat .
bullshit . . . i ai not moving till i get something to eat . you have been treating me like shit ever since i came out here . if you do not like it , you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good bye . and i want some food some place nice . . some good people , nice music . . .
yeah , i am hungry too . i know of a place . let s go eat .
who would you call on the phone back at the booking station ?
you really do have onoe , huh , jack . . . that is her problem besides you ?
now , where we going , convict ?
i do not give out the details .
last night .
sure . then we had a fight this morning .
well ?
it is a long shot , but . . . billy used to tend bar here a few years back . i heard him talk about it .
this part of town , they will make us for heat the second we walk in . just back me up like you have got a piece . . .
back you up ? now why would i wanna do that ?
if they kick my ass , they will sure as hell carve yours up . . .
but you can handle it all right , huh ? real amazing how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats . . .
i been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers . all those clowns ever had going for em was a gun and a badge . . .
hey , you wanna bet ?
i got two problems . number one , i am not playing games . number two , you got nothing to bet with .
if we come outta this joint with ganz phone number , or a dead indian , or anything else useful , then you could turn the other way for half an hour while i get laid . . .
why ? anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably cannot get it up anyway .
i will tell you what happens if you lose . . . you tell the truth for once .
what are you talking about ?
you tell me what ganz busted out for , he is after a lot more than just getting out of jail . and whatever it is , you are part of it .
i do not know what you are talking about . i just wanna see ganz nailed .
i am gonna enjoy this . . . here , i will even loan you my badge .
this place do not seem real popular with the brothers .
that was not necessary , buddy . i got this under control .
you made that move , huh ?
there .
must be billy s girl .
let s go .
this sucks . a maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it . so , instead of me being where i oughta be , which is in bed giving my girl the high , hard one , i am out here doing this shit , roaming around with some overdressed , charcoal colored loser like you .
you wanna leave , man ? let me take care of ganz all by myself .
you ? do not make me laugh . you cannot take care of shit . you have been dicking me around since we started on this turd hunt . all you are good for is games . . . so far , what i got outta you is nothing . . .
i am impressed with you too , jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night .
maybe i do not like the way you ask .
yeah , right . you want to try again ?
naw , you would just call your pals back to bail you out one more time .
they saved your ass , convict .
i been waiting a long time for some money .
how much ?
half a million .
just tell me about the money .
me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale . it is the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen . i was sitting pretty , living in the high cotton , then somebody fingered me for another job . . . . some psycho who s out there capping people with some cop s gun .
he is after your money .
we split ?
not likely , convict .
you gonna let me keep any of it ?
where is the money ?
right , partner .
get this . we ai not partners . we ai not brothers . we ai not friends . if ganz gets away with my money , you are gonna be sorry we ever met .
where is the goddamn car ?
this will show you how smart i am . i got it parked .
. . . for three years ? let s hope it was not a tow away zone .
you son of a bitch . you knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait . i almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing .
i was not sure the money was still there until we saw luther . you almost got your ass shot off for nothing once , not twice , jack .
you took a big chance , leaving this here all this time .
not really . i figured ganz was put down for a long time . and i knew luther would never job me on his own . he is too chickenshit .
what ?
musta got some primo bondsman .
jesus christ , look at all the dust on my car . . . why in the hell do not he take it to a car wash ?
did not know you darker people went in for foreign jobs .
you would think the guy would be smart enough to know he was being tailed .
trying to save his girl , man . he is in another world .
if i was his size and had ganz on my ass , i would just leave town .
i am telling you the mangs in love . . . he wants to be a hero for his girl .
i suppose you would never be like luther and let a woman get to you . . .
i let women get to me . the quest for pussy is the meaning of life . . . i got my own personal philosophy about em . keep women separate from guns , money and business . . . women are for spending money . they got nothing to do with helping you make it .
say , do you always work people over like you did luther ?
if they do not tell me what i need to know . . .
does not it get . . . tiring ?
i am not in this cause it is fun . i am not into hitting guys cause it makes me feel good either . . . i do it cause it works . . .
maybe luther hopes ganz will give him a piece of your money . . .
a long time agb luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain . . . that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row . . .
you know , i would be embarrassed if i let my wheels go the way you have done with this job .
what you do not understand is , i do not give a damn about how this thing looks .
no class . . .
we are getting too close . . . cates , that is the matter , you been taking dumb pills ?
that was in style a couple years back , man .
bullshit . then i am staying with the money .
you stay with me . . .
hey , jack , how ya doing ? what took you so long to call , man ? i been waiting . . . i am at vromangs up in the fillmore . yeah , vromangs . . . course you do not hang out here it is for the brothers .
where is luther ?
be polite . say hello . this is candy .
what about luther ?
we missed .
you missed . . . luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street . made a phone call .
maybe we should pay luther a visit .
they must have set up a meeting for the morning luther left an am wake up and put up the do not disturb sign . he is trading his girl for the money . all we have to do to grab ganz is not go blind .
tell me something . why did not you just take the money off luther and split ?
i do not know why , but i am going to let you keep it . maybe because you told me you had it , or maybe just because i am too tired to argue . . .
thanks for calling in . . . and i guess maybe . . . look , i am sorry i called you watermellon nigger . . . those kinds of things . i was just leaning on ya , doing my job .
being good at your job do not explain everything , jack . . .
yeah , i see her .
that was quick .
when you been in prison three years , it do not take long . let s go .
why ?
notice something funny about that bus ?
hey , how would my car get here ?
i had it impounded . come on , we will use it for hauling you back to the slam .
back to jail in my own car . ganz got away . got all my money . it just do not seem right .
sorry we did not do better , jack . i feel like i let you down .
naw , you did not let me down . it was a long shot all the way . we gave em a good run at it .
it is late , they are closing . . .
yeah , well the only woman of the indiangs we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend . i guess she went with him before she came outta the closet . . . they both looked mad enough to kill him . . .
do i get to kiss her too ?
what if your girl s theory turns out to be bullshit ? i mean , they could be in rio de janeiro .
hey , there she is . . .
whatever play i maker just back me up .
if we run into billy first , let me try and talk him in .
sure , i will give you a shot at it , but ganz is mine . you know , that big indian plays it for keeps . . .
yeah , and i know ganz sure ai not no sweetheart . . . i would not like it if this partnership ended before it gets started .
partnership ?
you okay ?
yeah . but i was not there for a second .
okay , reggie , start busting my chops . . . tell me how great you were with that chick .
wait a minute , cates . i have been waiting three years for that . i do not think it is fair , man . what about the merit system . ? you were gonnna give me a few thousand .
it is your money . it will be here in six months when you get out .
and you are telling me you do not want any of this cash ?
that is right . not my style , reggie . .
you are an awesomely weird cop . sure wish there were more like you running around out here .
no , you do not . if i ever get word of you stepping over the line again , i am gonna ventilate that suit of yours .
thanks .
i want to be left alone on this one . algren was killed with my gun .
hey , the bastard s got my gun . i want it back .
yeah . . .
anthing bothering you besides losing your gun ?
yeah . it bothers me when cops get hurt while i am making a play . i do not like it .
you might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one , jack .
being a hot dog s worked pretty well for me so far . . . besides , i got a lead . . .
okay . you are not a team player . you gotta do things your own way . fine . nail this guy and make us all look good . but you better watch your ass . if you screw up , i can promise you , you are going down .
you really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude . he starts to go .
jack ?
yeah ?
try not to get your ass shot to pieces . we got enough dead cops on this one .
what the bell happened ?
i lost them , that is what happened .
how did they get away ?
which one pulled the trigger ?
the indian . i was about yards away .
what a screw up .
do not duck the bullet cates . why did not you call in for backup instead of making a grandstand play ?
i did not have the time .
he is got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop i have worked with .
where the christ do you think you are going ?
that is what you say , cates . . .
yeah .
but that is what you say about all of us all the tine . . . we are always the ones fucking up when you tell it . . .
somebody steals your gun , you are supposed to file a report .
are you gonna tell me about police procedure ? do me a favor , do not give me a bunch of crap .
is that what this guy ganz had in the hotel ?
every last bit of it . the big guy s room was empty .
this guy must have had a . like yours , jack . now he is got yours .
billy bear . . .
who are all these ?
they all pulled a bunch of jobs with ganz about four years ago .
wait a minute , wait a minute . . . who s this ?
tell me that is not the same guy .
i think i wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking . can we find them ?
here s the file . cates checks the file .
you look awful .
so do you . . . been a long day .
long night , too , from what i heard . . . word s going around that in addition to losing ganz for the second time , and in addition to haden busting you back to patrolman , some jig beat the crap out of you .
aw , bullshit , you heard wrong .
does not look like it .
nothing came in for me yet ? no calls ?
bullshit red tape .
i got to wait for a call .
i almost forgot . that pal of yours from the vice squad wants you to call him .
jesus christ . why the hell did not you tell me before ?
a cop . . .
i sure ai not his fairy godmother . . . now i am looking for ganz . . . where is he ?
have not seen him for years . that is the truth .
you just took a shot at me , asshole . i think you do know where he is .
ganz and billy got my girl , rosalie .
i think i met her . now tell us something we do not know , like where they stashed her .
he . . . he wants me to help him skip town .
when ? how ?
what am i wanted for ?
i do not think your gungs loaded . . .
this is a . magnum , the most powerful handgun in the world . you gotta ask yourself just one question . are you feeling lucky ?
hey , you are right .
you are hopeless .
i am all wet .
a guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today .
what would you do ?
irrigated his face with the shot of j and b i would just poured him . then i tried to deck the sucker .
i guess he got the message . . .
then i sit back and i think , i mean , who s to say i am not a dumb bitch . i work in a bar , right ? i cannot read a list of my academic credentials to every booze hound that comes in the place . . . you are what you do . . .
positive self image problem all over again . . . you are who you decide you are unless you are the type that lets assholes decide for you .
are not you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit ?
i do think all psychotherapy is bullshit . but just because i think it is bullshit does not mean i do not know something about it .
if this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems , i will take brutal indifference .
hey , you know what i really think ?
tell me i am dying to hear it .
you know , if you let me come over to your place once in a while , you could put on a clean shirt in the morning .
maybe you ought to buy me one .
that is a fairly crummy way to start a morning .
maybe i got a fairly crummy day ahead .
maybe that makes a nice excuse .
when you start with that attitude . . . it is like i do not know who you are .
what do you want to know ? what difference does it make ? i am the guy in your bed the last three months . i make you feel good . you make me feel good . what the hell else do you want from a guy ?
you know something , jack , you really are hopeless .
that is the way i see it , too .
call me later .
you sure you want me to ?
thanks for the coffee .
i think you forgot this . hands him his wallet and badge . . .
great place for lunch .
yeah , one of my favorites .
yeah , guess it must have been a slow news day . . .
jack , are you okay ?
look , spare me the macho bullshit about your gun . . .
bullshit ? i will tell you about bullshit . my gungs a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it . it is not my macho bullshit that is killing people , my gun is . . .
look , jack , if you make everything your personal responsibility , you will turn into a bad cop . it is not a practical way to function . . .
i did not get burned , two cops did . listen , i will tell you about personnel responsibility . i like to get the job done right . and if i do not get my job done right . . . i am for shit .
here it comes again . . . the sacred job . . .
that is right . i am not like you . i am not gonna sit on my ass wondering that is right and that is wrong . . . there s a psycho out there killing people with my gun and i am gonna get him . because it is my job . and if you do not get that . . .
just one . some lady called . said she is a little hot headed sometimes . . . but she still wants her occasional roommate . she would like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight . . . if it is humanly possible . . . .
listen , goddamn it if you think i am happy about it , you are nuts . i just gotta take care of a few things , okay ?
i am at work , asshole . where else ?
elaine ! i . . . i am sorry . . . i was expecting somebody else . . . police business .
no wonder you are so popular .
no , it is i am just surprised you called .
the number . . . that is the goddamn number ?
elaine , i gotta put you on hold . . .
jack , wait . . .
hello .
hi , it is me . . .
hey , i do not believe it .
hiya , kid .
i ought to have you and your friend thrown out . . .
do not . we have had a hard night .
i can see that . pardon me for saying so , but you look like shit . what happened ?
you real down ?
nothing . no sign of ganz . no sign of the indian . airport s clean . train station . bus station . docks . . . shit . . .
ganz is going to be hard to track . just a pure schizo . . . wires all crossed . . . totally without any pattern . . . kill anybody . . . the indian . . . himself . . . anybody . . .
how do you know ?
what makes you think they were lesbians , or as you so quaintly put it , dykes ?
come on , they were a little old for a slumber party .
it might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions . i was in bed with a girlfriend watching tv last week , jack , and one thing we know about me is i happen not to be a lesbian . . . now , if this indiangs girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him , it could just be she is still vulnerable to him .
so what ?
when a guy hurts you , then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees , who knows , he might just be irrestible .
hey , come on , shrink time s over . they would not go see some old girlfriend .
whaddya think ?
what do i know ? i am just a bartender .
how would they take it back at headquarters ?
usual bullshit . you make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend . . . you know something , shooting guys sucks . especially compared to this .
i have been waiting a long time to hear you say that .
three more hours . . .
where is he ?
promised i would turn my back while he . . . ah , never mind . . .
tell me .
you are impossible . . .
who the hell are you ?
i am not so sure i can say the same thing . . . you do not look like a cop .
well , i been working the other side of the street for the last few years . and you do not exactly look like a shrink , wearing that dress . . .
hard man to live with .
how would you know ?
hey , two days with him is enough .
he was the only one of my bunch that was my friend . . . he was loyal , went all the way for you . . .
hey . . .
shut up .
what do you want ? that is going on ?
stall .
keep stalling .
how hot are they ?
how ya doing ?
cannot complain .
we got a lot to talk about .
yeah , old times .
we will follow you . take it slow , okay ?
surprise , luther .
whaddya want ? i thought you were locked up
i want the money , asshole , what do you think ? the money that reggie hid . . .
i do not know what you are talking about .
instead of worrying about reggie , you better worry about me . . .
do not give me this , we were partners .
billy , go ahead , break it . . .
no ! do not kill her . i can get you the money .
when ?
i cannot get it until monday . honest .
you chickenshit punk . . .
come on , you can trust me . please .
let her go .
rosalie , you okay ?
how you doing , man ?
you want to go outside ?
you sure ?
how about some ammo ?
how much ?
this is clean shit . no serial numbers and never been used . . .
do not mess with me . how much ?
five bills .
five . on credit .
yeah , i know that , but this is me and we are old friends . i have not got the money so what are you gonna do about it ?

fuck you . you got no right for this kind of play .
appipulai leeloo minai . .

zorg . jean baptiste emmanuel zorg . . . nice to see you again
i remember you now . . the so called art dealer .
i am glad you got your memory back , father . . . because you are going to need it . . . where are the stones ?
. . . why on earth do the stones interest you ?
personally , they are of no interest to me , i would rather sell weapons . . but i have a customer . . . so tell me . . .
even it i did know where the stones were i would never tell somebody like you .
why ? that is wrong with me ?
. . . i am a priest ! i am here to serve life , all you want to do is destroy it .
. . . would you like a drink ?
no thank you .
. . . look at all these little things . . . so busy all of a sudden . notice how each one is useful . what a lovely ballet , so full of form and color . so full of . . life !
father , by creating a little destruction , i am , in fact , encouraging life ! so , in reality , you and i are in the same business !
destroying a glass is one thing . . killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another .
you are a monster , zorg !
excuse me , i am looking for a priest .
she is not my bride , she is my fare . she is looking for this vito cornelius . according to the phone guide he lives here .
that is me . but i do not know who she is . . . where did you find her ?
who are you ?
i brought the girl remember ?
he is a she !
you noticed . . .
there s not a moment to lose ! wake her up , but be gentle about it ! this woman is mankind s most precious possession ! she is . . . perfect !
so you do know her .
they all like this in your family , father ?
she is an exception . .
thank you so much for your help mr . . . ?
yes . that is fine ! thank you very much . a thousand times over !
i might call to check up on her , you know . . . to see if she is better ?
she is fine , really . . do not you worry . . just needs some rest . . she is had a very long trip .
excuse me ! just one thing ! she said something to me a while ago and . . . i do not really get it . . . akta gamat ?
it means , never without my permission .
i am sorry to have to resort to such methods , but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to fhloston .
is that the usual way priests go on vacation ?
we are not going on vacation . . we are on a mission . .
what kind of mission ?
we have to save the world .
good luck . .
of course .
what are you doing ?
you are probably very angry with me and i quite understand . but i want you to know i am fighting for a noble cause .
yeah , i know . . . to save the world . . . but right now all i want to do is save leeloo .
leeloo s in trouble ?
when is she not in trouble ?
do not tell me you do not know how all this works ?
there s no light ! you told me there were supposed to be four beams of light .
yes , of course , but . . . the stones are shut ! they have to be open for it to work .
and you do not know how they open , is that what you are saying ?
imagine for a moment that this . thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be , because it is the antithesis of all we are . because it is evil . . total evil .
your theory is interesting father but i do not think we have time to go into it right now !
time is of no importance , mr . president . only life is important .
we have forty eight hours , the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions .
and then ?
is there anything that can stop it ?
but what happens if instead of this . . . ultimate warrior . . . it is evil who stands here ?
did you see that . . thing . . swallow our battleship like a gum drop ? you cannot even tell me what it is ! i ask you for options you give me bullshit . give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards .
what are we going to do ?
it is a miracle ! ! !
what is ?
father , will you please explain that is going on ?
father . you sure she is the supreme being ?
that is she doing ?
uh father , i know she is been through a lot . . . but the sacred stones . . we do not have much time . .
there was this guy with a limp who came a month ago . . said he was an art dealer . . . asking all these questions about the sacred stones . . at the time i did not think anything of it . . what was his name ? i am so bad with names . . .
they really made her . . .
i got it ! everything here we need to know about fhloston paradise hotel . . . and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel !
where is leeloo ?
on the plane . . . with mr . dallas . . . the real one .
you are all safe . thanks be to god !
you are a good man . . . she was right to have chosen you . . .
who ?
leeloo . . . is . . . she is . . .
yes , and more than that . . . you must give her the stones , she is the only one who knows how to use them .
she was taught to love the life of others . . . but not her own . you have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live !
i will help her , i promise , but i think you should tell me where the stones are !
do you love her ?
i . . . i do not know ! we hardly know each other . . . it takes time !
i do not have time . . . i need to know .
listen , the last time i admitted to a woman i loved her . . . i never saw her again .
i am sorry , but . . . the stones . . .
yeah ?
i love you too major , but you have not called me that since basic training .
i was talking to the cat .
at least , the cat comes back .
you still pining for that two timing bitch . forget her . there are a million women out there .
i do not want a million i just want one . a perfect one .
i just found a picture of you .
how do i look ?
i do not need one .

is that all ?
major dallas , if our calculations are correct you still have hours owed to the federal army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance .
what mission ?
to save the world .
where have i heard this song before ?
you are to leave immediately for fhloston paradise . retrieve four stones from the diva plavalaguna . and bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible . any questions ?
just one . . . why me ?
two of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated .
and the third one ?
do not you open your messages ?
i have had enough good news for today
you could not come up with something a little more discreet ?
old tricks are the best tricks eh ?
i am not going .
why not ?
. . . shit !
it is my wife .
i thought you were divorced .
. . . sorry , general , but we have got no choice ! it will only take a minute ! let me set up another meeting and i will be back .
three of us will never fit in there !
apipoulai !
valo massa . . . chacha hamas .
you hear that ?
cornelius . .
dinoine chagantakat !
apipoulai !
love . . .
sometimes you cannot learn everything from a screen . . sometimes it is better to ask someone who has experience . .
finished what ?
learning language .
which one ?
you learned languages in five minutes ? !
yes ! now it is your turn ! i learned your language , you have to learn mine !
i know how to say hello . teach me how to say good bye , that is all i need .
apipoussan !
apipoussan ?
good ! do you know how we say make love ?
uh . . .
here we go again . . .
you know women normally change five times more than men .
you get that off the screen ?
yes . . . you know there s a lot of differences between men women .
you noticed . .
where you going ?
i am going to see the diva sing . that is the matter ? . . . do i look bad ?
i told you i need to work in peace . remember ? i need to concentrate .
and you cannot concentrate with me around ? .
you are nothing but a . . . a . . .
i am so very sad .
why ? we did pretty well , would not you say ?
five hundred wars . . . arms . . . drugs . . . money . . . everything you create is used to destroy . . .
i told you not to read all that crap !
leeloo ? the stones ! we have to open them ! how does it work ?
the wind blows . . . the fire burns . . .
i know all that , leeloo ! i am talking about the stones .
it is up to you now , angel !
i am so tired . . .
you can sleep tomorrow . . . come on . . .
i want to sleep . . . forever . . .
that is the use of saving lives . . . when you see what you do with them !
you are right but there are lots of good things . . . beautiful things . . .
. . . like love . . .
exactly .
i have thousands of memories but none of them are mine . . . there is no need for me other than this . i am immortal but i have no life .
yes , you do ! i need you . more than you can imagine ! stand up straight !
why ? . . . why would you need me ?
tell me . . .
not going to open ?
i have never gotten a message that was not bad news .
how someone strong like you scared from a message ? is good news i sure !
the last two messages i got ? the first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving ! and the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too . . . with my wife .
at least i won lunch .
the cash man !
been here long ?
is not that a z ? alleviated titanium . neuro charged assault model ?
uh . .
it is not ?
thanks . .
this is all that survived ?
actually only one cell survived . .
have you identified it ?
it is not that easy . . we have never encountered anything like it before . . you see normal human beings have dna memo groums . . which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself . . this one has , .
talk english doc .
this cell is like a huge library . it has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside . almost like it was . . . engineered .
sounds like a freak of nature to me .
the compositional elements of his dna chain are the same as ours , there are simply more of them tightly packed . his knowledge is probably limitless . .
is there any danger ? some kind of virus ?
. . . this is the crucial phase , the reconstruction of pigment . cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react , to protect themselves . that means growing skin . clever , eh ?
this thing solid ?
mr . president , let me introduce you to professor mactilburgh , who runs the center .
i managed to contact the mondoshawan . they deplore the incident , but accept our apologies .
and the stones ? did you find them in the wreckage ?
the stones were not aboard the ship .
i want your best man on this !
they just landed in the desert .
staedert , do you read me ?
is that better ?
perfect , mr . president .
i have to address the supreme council in minutes . just the facts , general .
there are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet , all the calibers are overshot . . we are hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging . .
not yet sir . . the only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger !
options .
wait or act .
recommendations .
my philosophy mr . president is shoot first ask questions later . i do not like uninvited guests .
staedert ? that is going on ? did you destroy it ?
lord forgive me . . they already know too , much . .
. . in which all the history of the universe resides . . all the strength . . all the hope . . protect us from evil . .
father . . it in the most extraordinary thing . . the greatest find in history . . can you imagine the implications .
a weapon against evil . amazing ! i am going to be famous .
drink !
how is that ? can you hear me better now ?
yes , mr . zorg , i hear you perfectly ! so , how was the concert ?
who gives a shit ! i did not come here to listen to music ! listen up instead of running off at the mouth ! the batteries on my phone are almost gone .
yes , sir !
dispatch me another zfx immediately . someone stole mine .
right away , sir . i will send you a new one to the hotel .
am i disturbing you ?
. . . not far , now .
do you have the picture now mr . zorg ?
got it .
how is our deal coming along ?
the stones will be here . i will see to it personally !
welcome home .
that is this . . . have you been smoking . . . ?
smoking ? i am not smoking .
your clothing reeks of it .
you know , amy , i have been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy . . . i mean , is this what i get first thing ? before you even hello , you accuse me . . . ?
i am not accusing you . . .
well , i am not smoking , okay ?
okay , i believe you .
how is the detective business ?
business was fine . i will tell you what , you could not pay me enough to live down there .
you better not be smoking , that is all i can say .
i love you .
you think you will have time for the water heater this weekend ?
sure . i will call the guy .
you are not using the same guy who tried to fix it ?
i am not using him again for anything . he was worthless . you have bridge here saturday ?
this is the mortgage . this is cindy s college money .
i understand .
sometimes you cannot know what i am doing . it is better that way .
i know .
it is a missing persons case . . . a long shot . i will give it two months , two months at most , then i will be back . we will take a vacation .
why the gun ?
hello ?
amy , it is me . listen very carefully . .
amy , just listen . take cindy and get out of the house . do it now . go to a hotel and stay there . . .
that is wrong ? are you alright ?
i am okay . please , honey , i cannot explain . do not use the phone , just pack a bag and get out . i am on my way . i will be back at the house in three hours . call me from the hotel when you get there
. . . that is going on ?
what happened to you ?
i am okay , honey , i am okay . are you alright ?
that is going on , tom ? what happened ?
i cannot tell you , amy . you know i cannot . you have to trust me . . .
tom . . .
why have not you called ? why do not you answer your phone ?
i do not know . i am sorry . . .
you owe me an explanation . you cannot treat me like this .
i wanted to call . i could not .
you could not ?
you do not understand . . .
no , i do not , because you are not telling me anything !
you should have .
amy , i am not going to let anything happen to us .
look where we are . look at yourself . you son of a bitch , you do not have any idea what you are putting me through . . .
i do not know what to say
you are killing me . . .
do not . . .
what was i supposed to think happened to you ? !
who are you calling ?
mrs . christian .
what ?
she is all i have got . she is the only witness .
she died in her sleep three days ago . it was in the paper . . .
what are these ?
anything harder ?
there s nothing harder .
snuff ?
what you see is what i got , mister .
you know where i can get it ? i have a lot of money to spend .
what do you want ?
i just got a call . . . two seconds ago , some motherfucker called . . . says he knows about the loop .
what are you talking about ?
the loop ! the girl we did , what the fuck do you think i am talking about ? ! this guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop . . .
bullshit .
i am telling you . . .
blow me , you paranoid fuck , that is impossible . why are you bothering me with this . . . ?
because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out !
there s nothing there , you brain dead cunt . think about it . there s absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything . i want you to hang the phone up , and if you call me about this again i am going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader .
dino . . .
what the fuck . . . !
it is an honor to meet you . thank you for seeing us .
i would like to commission a work . i am a great admirer of yours .
flattering . and , who s your colorful little chum ?
a fellow investor .
you said something about money .
that is five thousand dollars .
is it ?
five thousand now , five thousand on delivery . two women , one white and one black , as long as they have large breasts . hard bondage , or course . other than that , trusting your artistic interpretation , i have only two stipulations .
and they are ?
i want to watch you work .
i will consider it .
and the other performer . . . it has to be that monster you use . . . the man in the mask .
machine .
he might be interested . . . but it would mean another five thousand .
we can do that .
you have a beautiful face . . . the way the light hits it . i would like to take your picture . you do not mind ?
i would rather you did not .
that is the problem ?
i am camera shy .
you trust me to keep your money , but not to take your picture ?
i will do this for you . fifteen thousand dollars .
machine s in ?
where is that ?
you brought the money ?
excellent .
where are the women ?
what are these for ?
hmm ? oh , the knifes ? they are just props . nice , are not they ?
mister welles . . . would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person ?
what are you . . . ?
empty the gun onto the table , very carefully .
look , i do not know what this . . .
you remember mr . longdale , do not you ?
friend of yours ?
look , he is got nothing to do with this . . . let him go . . .
can you guess what i am going to say next ?
he does not know anything . . . he is got nothing to do with this . . .
i will get it . it is in a safe deposit box , in the city . . .
is that him ?
do not let longdale s questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas . if his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you , you will be just as dead . . . and so will max .
you are a dead man .
leave him alone .
. . . sorry . . .
you got the guts , tough guy ? gonna kill us all , is that it ?
what can i do for you , mr . welles ?
call me tom .
alright , tom .
what i would like , very simply , is access to your archive . and , now i understand this is not something you normally do for private citizens . . .
there are reasons for the way we do things here .
few days ago , i was contacted by a couple living in philadelphia , a doctor and his wife . what happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off , which heads into philadelphia , started up a conversation with this girl , she looked homeless , seemed about eighteen maybe . they convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city . nice kid , mature , did not have much to say , but they got a sense she is a runaway , so all through dinner the doctor s working on her , trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone . not surprisingly , she ate her food , excused herself . . . that is the last they saw her . the reason they came to me for help , the reason i am coming to you , is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch . . . they want to see if i can i . d . this girl , somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid s alive , doing alright .
why not go to the n . c . i . c . or n . c . m . e . c . ?
i figured you share information .
we do .
for whatever reasons i thought you might be more receptive .
why do not they come to me ?
this doctor and wife , they are nice people , but they do not want to get too involved . they are not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either . you and i both know sometimes , not often , but sometimes there s real reasons why a kid will run . molestation , whatever . besides that , the girl s probably eighteen , so she is legal .
i am not so sure about this .
they are putting themselves in place of this kid s parents and thinking they would want to hear their girl s okay , even if that is all they hear .
they were pretty clear they did not want this coming back on them .
files are mostly by state and year of disappearance . we try to keep the children and adults separate . no eating or smoking in here , but there s a coffee machine in the hall .
any good ?
it is horrible , but it will be your best friend after a few days . i hope you realize what kind of long shot you are chasing after .
you are gonna be seeing a lot of me . you are sure you do not mind ?
celebrity films .
eddie .
yeah , who s this ?
i know what you did .
what ?
i know what you did .
who is this .
you murdered that girl , eddie . six years ago . . .
what the fuck are you . . ?
that is he talking about ?
i am gonna kill you .
do not bore me with that bullshit .
do not ask questions .
starting to recognize a pattern ?
what do you want ?
who is machine ?
i do not know . . .
i want his name .
i told you , i do not know .
i will never get tired of hurting you , eddie , so you might want to change your attitude .
okay , we will come back to that . so , six years ago a guy contacts you , through the classifieds , over the phone , however he does it . it is longdale , looking for a snuff film . and you , entrepreneur that you are , tell him you can hook him up .
yeah , the fucking lawyer .
told him you could get him a snuff film .
yeah .
how much did he pay you ?
thirty thousand each , that fucking cocksucker .
that is all ? thirty each . that is all it took for you to murder her ?
so . . . you brought dino in , and he brought machine . and , one day , a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models . and she never walked out .
something like that .
what did you do , knock her out , shoot her up . . . ?
what the fuck do you want from me ?
i want to know . i want to know exactly what you did to her !
show me where you did it , on the map , exactly where you did it .
why ?
i do not know . i felt like it . i never saw anyone get done before .
you enjoy it ?
made me sick , but what did i care ? what did i care if some hump wants to beat off to that . it was just something i was doing for money .
tell me what happened .
what do you want to know ? you saw it , you saw the loop . . .
nobody saw you bring her in ?
there was not nobody around . this place was a shit hole . i backed up the car to the door and we carried her in , like groceries . dino made her eat a bunch of pills , we laid out the plastic , put film in the camera and machine went to work .
what did you do with her body ?
took it out the bathroom window . buried it in the woods .
keep moving .
you cannot go to the cops . all you can do is cut me loose and walk away , because you got nothing . . .
stop talking .
you got absolute zero .
show me where you buried her .
i do not know . . . . . . out there somewhere .
where ? show me where .
do it .
do not think i will not .
do it ! put me out of my misery so i do not have to listen to you whining anymore . you think it is so easy ?
easy enough for you .
i never killed anyone .
that is right , you just stood there and watched , because you felt like it . almost makes you worse .
you know how my tapes sell . people eat this stuff up .
i had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month . do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt , and try to fucking return it ?
maybe there s something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place , ever think of that ?
the only thing wrong is the cheap , softcore crap you are peddling , eddie . where do you get this stuff ?
look , you cocksucker . . .
get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head . till then , fuck you .
yes , i do have something to say . i insisted on being here as soon as i heard mrs . christian contacted you .
i am listening .
as mr . christiangs attorney and one of the executors of his estate , it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend .
of what sort ?
you are a private investigator ?
that is right .
you were the middleman , am i right ? old man christian was not about to go shopping for a snuff film himself .
would not exactly have been possible for a man of his stature .
so , he sent you , gave you the money , his errand boy . and if you refused , it was not like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film . that is the beauty of lawyer client privilege .
that is trust . mr . christian trusted me implicitly .
must have paid you a lot , for you to risk everything . would have had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money .
i was well compensated .
that is why you got scared when mrs . christian hired me . you knew about the film , figured it had to be in that safe . how would you find me ?
never mind how i found you .
followed me . . . must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies . . .
they are no friends of mine .
except , you are willing commit murder with them .
none of this would be happening if you would have left it alone . if you were not digging up a girl who died six years ago . a girl no one even remembers .
you found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film , right ? wanted them to find you one . well , they did not find you one , longdale , they went out and made you one . . .
shut up .
mary anne mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered .
shut your mouth and drive !
you are making me very angry .
just tell me . tell me some more of the secrets you and christian shared . what kind of degenerate pervert was he really ? what the fuck did he want with a snuff film ?
you are asking me why ?
a man like mr . christian , a great man . . . all his money , all his power . . . a man who attained everything there was to attain . . .
why did he buy a film of some poor , lost girl getting butchered ?
is not it incredibly obvious ?
enlighten me .
you almost went over your limit .
give me the film .
give me the film .
he is lying .
big date tonight ?
yeah . . . guess so .
can i interest you in a battery operated vagina ?
pardon me ?
my boss tells me i have to do more suggestive selling .
well , it is tempting , but no thanks .
it is your call , but you are gonna be sorry when you are in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery operated vagina and you do not have one .
once you pick it up you cannot put it down .
truman capote .
i tear off the cover and paste this one on . . . you know how it is .
would not want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts .
remember me ?
i need some information . thought you might be able to help .
i do not know what you are looking for , mister , but so we are clear from the start , i am straight .
how long you been working there ?
three , four years .
that is your name , if you do not mind me asking ?
max .
well , here s the deal , max . this thing i am on right now has something to do with underground pornography . stuff that is sold under the counter , illegally . . .
there s not much illegal .
well , whatever there is , whoever s dealing , however it is done , i want to know . i want a good look , so if you have got that kind of connection , great . if not , speak now .
you are not a cop , are you ? if i ask and you are , you have to tell me .
i am not a cop .
you are a private eye . like shaft .
not quite .
from pennsylvania . p . i . from pa . what are you doing out here ?
well , there s the thing you are not gonna know anything about what i am doing , but you can make some money .
how much ?
how much do you make now ?
four hundred a week , off the books .
okay , let s pretend i live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump . i will give you six hundred for a few days .
sounds good , pops .
here s my number if you need it . . . when can you start ?
tomorrow night , i get off at eight .
. . . hello . . . ?
you have got penthouse , playboy , hustler , etc . nobody even considers them pornography anymore . then , there s mainstream hardcore . triple x . the difference is penetration . that is hardcore . that whole industry s up in the valley . writers , directors , porn stars . they are celebrities , or they think they are . they pump out videos a week . a week . they have even got a porno academy awards . america loves pornography . anybody tells you they never use pornography , they are lying . somebody s buying those videos . somebody s out there spending million dollars a year on phone sex . know what else ? it is only gonna get worse . more and more you will see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream , because that is evolution . desensitization . oh my god , elvis presley s wiggling his hips , how offensive ! nowadays , mtv s showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out . know what i mean ? for the porn addict , big tits are not big enough after a while . they have to be the biggest tits ever . some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head , literally . soon , playboy is gonna be penthouse , penthouse will be hustler , hustler will be hardcore , and hardcore films will be medical films . people will be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds . there s nowhere else for it to go .
interesting theory .
what you saw tonight , we are not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend . we are talking about stuff where people get hurt . specialty product .
child pornography .
there s two kinds of specialty product legal and illegal . foot fetish , shit films , watersports , bondage , spanking , fisting , she males , hemaphrodites . . . it is beyond hardcore , but legal . this is the kind of hardcore where one guy s going to look at it and throw up , another guy looks at it and falls in love . now , with some of the s m and bondage films , they straddle the line . how are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not ? step over that line , you are into kiddie porn . rape films , but there are not many . i have never seen one .
snuff films .
i heard you asking . that guy was not yanking you around . there s no such thing .
what other ways are there to get illegal films ? who do you see ?
how old are you ?
twenty five .
where are your parents ?
i do not know , where are yours ?
i do not mean any offense . . . but what are you doing mixed up in all this ?
i am not mixed up in anything , hayseed . what are you talking about ?
you just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else .
yeah , i am a real genius . what choices have i got ? fuck , just because i know about stuff like tonight does not mean i deal it . i work a job . it beats pumping gas , beats making hamburgers .
you are telling me it does not get to you ?
you cannot sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb . so what ? am i gonna go off and be a race car driver ? go to harvard ? run for president ? what about you , pops ?
what about me ?
i see a ring on your finger . you have any kids ?
a daughter .
so , you have a wife and kid waiting for you in pennsylvania . . . what are you doing mixed up in all this ?
dino velvet . . . yeah , he is like the john luc godard of s m flicks , supposed to be a real weirdo .
a weirdo making s m films ? who would have thought it ?
his stuff comes out of new york . bondage and fetish videos , gothic hardcore . definitely not for the squeamish .
specialty product .
you are learning .
where does he sell it ?
out of the back of bondage magazines mostly , but you can find it on the street if you look . he will also do commissions , for enough money . . .
nothing illegal , it is always borderline . like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a . . .
alright , i get the picture .
he cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies photographs , newsreel footage , subliminal images . thinks he is making art .
well , i am in new york now . what do you say to flying out and giving me a hand ?
i am a working stiff , pops .
take a vacation . i will pay you four hundred a day , plus expenses .
you want me to come out there and play private eye ?
consider it . meanwhile , dig up whatever dino velvet films you can . get receipts . i will call back .
you did not say it was gonna be this luxurious .
it is their presidential suite .
oh , come on , man , what are we doing in this flea bag ?
wha . . . ?
who is he ?
i told you , he is one of dino velvet s stock players . . .
who is he , his name ?
you do not need to be here .
i know if i had to pick , it would be choke , or devil .
that is next ?
i am trying to figure that out myself . i have to see machine without his mask .
still do not want to tell me what you are doing ?
that is this ?
look . . . that is awful generous and everything . . .
mister welles . you are very prompt .
uh huh , pleasure .
have a pleasant evening . will you have tea , mister welles ?
he is odd .
i have spoken to friends of mine and my husband s , in harrisburg , in lancaster and hershey . asking about you . i must say you have friends in influential places .
i have been privileged to provide services for people i admire .
as you know , my husband passed away recently . two weeks ago now .
my condolences .
his passing has left me with . . . something of a dilemma . a terrible , terrible dilemma .
pittsburgh ?
mostly . that is where he started his empire building . he was a good man . notorious as an eccentric , but that was something he cultivated . he wanted to be legendary .
he succeeded .
do you carry a gun , mr . welles ?
i wear a gun when i can tell a client expects me to . other than that , there s never any reason .
my husband was the only one with the combination to this safe . i knew about it , but as far as i was concerned it was none of my business . not till now , that is .
you hired someone to open it . i will bet the lawyer loved that .
there was nothing he could do . my husband left everything to me . i prevented anyone from seeing the contents . i felt these were my husband s private things . i did not . . . i did not realize . . .
do you want to tell me what you found ?
it is a film . . . of a girl being murdered .
i am afraid i do not . . .
i did not know what to think . i cannot tell you how horrible it is been , to know this belonged to my husband . to know that he watched this . . . this atrocity . but , i cannot go to the police . . .
please , believe me . this is probably a stag film . simulated rape . hard to stomach , and it might seem real , but there are ways of making it look realistic . . . fake blood and special effects . . .
no .
if you were to study it you would see the camera cutting away . . . you would see the tricks they can play . . .
i am telling you it is not that .
i am sure it is . it is probably something your husband was given as a bad joke . more than likely he never even watched it .
will you watch it and see for yourself ?
you . . . you need to go to the police .
i told you i cannot , not yet .
you do not have any other choice .
no . for me to live with the ruin of my husband s name , i need know that whoever did this will be punished . if you can find them , i will take their names to the police . i will say my husband confessed on his death bed . i will say i did not have courage to come forward at first . . .
it will not work like that .
i deal in divorce cases . corporate investigations . . .
you have found missing persons before .
nothing remotely like this .
okay . . .
my husband never dealt with money personally , certainly not cash .
i am not positive this means anything .
one was for two hundred thousand , one dollar and thirteen cents . another was for three hundred thousand , six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents . . .
okay , i follow you so far . . .
totalled together , these five checks from five different accounts , they equal one million dollars .
you are joking .
hello . . . ?
i am here .
do you think the film could have cost that much ?
for a human life . . . murder on film , no statute of limitations . who knows ? it sure could have . i would like you to overnight me a copy of those checks , then put them in a safe deposit box .
okay .
send it to me through the post office like we arranged . no return address . you dug this up all by yourself ?
you told me to look , so i looked .
hello ?
mrs . christian , tom welles here .
how are you ? having any luck ?
i do not know if luck s the word . are you feeling alright ?
i have been ordered into bed . the doctor says i have gotten the flu , or some other wretched ailment .
i hope it is nothing serious .
nothing more than a bother . have you any news for me ?
i have made progress . i am in manhattan . once a few more pieces fall into place , i will drive to you and give you an update .
i have got about five thousand left in cash , but i will need another thirty , if you approve .
how will i get it to you ?
yes . . . ?
i have been hired as an independent contractor by the u . s . resource center for missing persons as part of an internal audit . if you have any time over the next few days , i would like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter .
i do not understand , who are . . . ?
i am sorry , let me explain , the r . c . m . p . is a support organization and archive , not unlike the center for missing and exploited children in washington . i am sure you have dealt with them before ?
yes , but . . .
what was the name . . . ? i have got it here somewhere . . .
neil . . . neil cole .
right , agent cole told me he would call and let you know to expect me . he did not call ?
no .
it is very important you do not let this raise your expectations . it is not going to effect any ongoing efforts . all i am saying is , please know , i am not here to create any false hope .
they hired you . you are like , a private detective ?
i did not think there were private detectives anymore , except on tv .
so , she did not leave a note ? she never gave any indication where she might go , before she left ?
no .
she just seemed . . . depressed . . . ?
she did not seem herself . for months there never was any way to get her to talk about it . one night we went to bed . . . the next morning she was gone . she took some clothes .
what was she running from ?
i do not know .
if there s anything you feel uncomfortable talking about , tell me , but i have to ask . your husband . . . he committed suicide ?
yes .
september th , . about a year after mary disappeared .
we were divorced by then . things fell apart . . . he was living with a friend . . .
why do you think he did it ?
it got to be too much for him .
you have to forgive me , but in these circumstances . . . with your daughter . . . were there any indications of . . . any sort of abuse ?
there was not anything like that . the police and the fbi people asked , but there was not anything happened like that , never . my husband . . . his heart broke when mary left . . .
i did not mean to . . .
you try going through what we did . bob could not take it , that is all . christ , there s times when it still seems like i cannot either .
i had to ask . i apologize .
people remember me from the news . can you drive me back now ?
i . . . i should not take anymore of your time . maybe we can finish tomorrow . i will call tomorrow . . .
does not make much sense , does it ? when everything s happy , when life s fine and you have every reason to believe there s a god , you do not bother . then , something horrible happens . . . that is when you start praying all the time . that is when you start going to church .
we are all like that .
are you religious ?
no .
i have got what i need for my report . there is . . . there is one thing that bothers me though .
what ?
it is not really my place , but it is not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either . see , i know a little about missing persons . when kids run , they almost always leave a note . it is guilt . they want to say goodbye .
there was not one . the police looked .
do you think the police did a good job ?
i do not know . i think so .
it is possible . . . and i know this is not something you want to hear . your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it , but where she knew your husband would never find it . she might have wanted to tell you something . . .
no . you do not have any reason to think that . . .
how . . . how can you say that to me . . . ?
will you let me look ?
my husband never laid a hand on her . she would have told me . . . she would have told me . . .
you were right . i did not find anything . i am going to run and get something to eat . are you hungry ?
i think about it everyday . but , every time the phone rings . . . every single time , i still think it is her .
it is been six years .
hello . . . ?
mrs . mathews ? it is thomas . do you remember , i was there a few weeks ago . . . asking about your daughter . . .
i remember . you just left . . .
what are you talking about . . . ?
she went to california , to los angeles . . . she wanted to start over . she wanted to be an actress . . .
mrs . mathews , your daughter is dead . she is dead .
who is this . . . ?
someone . . . some men , they took your daughter and they drugged her , and they took her to a motel room . . . they did terrible things to her . . .
who are you ?
they brought her into the room . . . one man , he put a knife to her throat and he raped her . . .
no . . .
he raped her and . . . and . . . and he murdered her . . . he cut her up with knifes . . .
no . . . no . . . no . . .
they killed her , and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her . . .
why . . . why are you doing this to me . . . ?
yes . . . i remember mary
you . . . you do ? you are sure ? please , sister , will you take another look , make sure . . .
do you know what happened to her ?
what is this ?
those are her belongings .
her belongings ?
whatever possessed you to keep this all this time ?
she was the kindest , sweetest girl you would ever want to meet . oh , i adored her . i supposed i always hoped she would be back . after a time , all i could do was pray she had moved on to better things . can you get this suitcase to her parents , if you think it is appropriate ?
your son in law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day , saw that woman every night . the specifics are in the report , and information about the woman . it is unpleasant , i know . i apologize . . .
none too discreet , is he ?
no , sir , he is not .
the um . . . you will find my invoice in the envelope . if that is all . . .
yes , mister welles , thank you .
okay , i will take it all .
excellent . we accept mastercard and american express .
alright . may i have your phone number , area code first ?
no , you may not .
i am required by state law to inform you that , while it is perfectly legal for you to purchase these items , it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of . . .
yeah , i know the spiel . if you could bag it , i will be on my way , thank you .
do not you think it kind of defeats the purpose ?
what ?
the mirror . you cannot see yourself in it .
yeah . she would be half as strict as you .
but she would not let dad treat me like that .
rick . . . i cannot .
alice , you think you can leave ?
that is wrong ?
kincaid and joey died last night .
you alright ?
i heard you screaming . was it a bad one ?
it was bad .
does not the dream master work for you anymore ?
hey , since when do you play thomas edison ? this looks like sheila s .
it is . . . was . it is a zapper , it might help me stay awake .
i cannot go back to sleep again .
we will figure it out .
figure it out ? ! ? ! i will be insane before i figure it out . the only thing i am sure of is that i cannot go to sleep . not while he is using me .
here you are . where were you this morning ? rick s looking all over for you .
have you seen joey and kincaid ! god , i cannot find them . i cannot find them anywhere .
i am sure they are around .
i love to dream , i just hate ones about my dad .
my mom taught me when i was little . did you ever hear of the dream master ?
sounds like a game show host to me .
no really , it is a fable . the guardian of good dreams . it was like my teddy bear when i was growing up .
i daydream . you have to dream about some place fun . remember you are in control .
how would you learn so much about dreams ?
you what ?
kristen , what happened ?
you in a hurry ?
i gotta get to the library before it closes . killer physics test .
i know . i hardly have any time to study .
maybe you should not be working here so much . you do not want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life .
ohhhhbaby , i am dead on my feet .
we have matching luggage .
you have been up all night ?
that obvious , huh ?
then you saw him , too ?
no . . .
you are his sister , right ?
rick stayed later after school with kristen . she was not feeling very well .
tell him i was looking for him , okay ? i am dan .
i thought it was an accident . smoking in bed .
i was there in the dream . he took her . it was awful . it was awful . . .
no , do not ! i gave sheila to him and now she is dead !
i have been working double shifts .
extra money , huh ?
no offense , or anything , but it is kind of hard to swallow .
how long have you been awake ?
alright , let s assume this whole thing is true . why does freddy all of a sudden need you ?
not really .
is there something we can do ?
you do not really get it . he is not a nightstalker . it will take more than bench presses to beat him .
why cannot we just talk to the authorities ?
yeah , right . let s trade death by freddy for life in a rubber room . adults will not see it . they cannot .
then what else can we do ?
try what other kids did . keep each other awake . we will meet at debbie s tonight . at least if we do not sleep he cannot get us .
he is going after debbie , i gotta stop him .
hey , you are not alone . we have to stop him , i am with you .
you just feel sorry for me .
as long as your driving does not kill us .
he is going after debbie . i gotta stop him .
here we are .
what the hell was that ?
you look great !
rick , please .
i think sheila s more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them .
asthma attack . . . what year old has a fatal asthma attack ? she was gonna be a doctor .
it was freddy .
enough of that crap .
t t thanks alice . . .
hey , rick !
i do not get it .
so that is up ? what would i miss ?
she told us the story of freddy . it is a town legend . he was a child killer who was freed on a technicality .
so ?
it pissed off a lot of parents . according to kristen , they hunted him down roasted him alive .
nice neighborhood .
hey man , we are all sorry . . .
been up with alice .
how she doing ? i ran into her last night .
she is blaming herself for sheila . i know how it feels . i have been thinking about kristen . maybe i could have stopped it , if i would listened .
about freddy ?
something the matter with the cuisine ?
well mom , i will tell ya , when two of your friends die the same day , you let me know what it does to your appetite .
that is wrong with me ?
i am sorry honey , but . . .
sorry ! ! sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who s now after me . in case you have not been keeping score , it is his fucking banquet , and i am the last course ! !
honey , we went over this in therapy .
something wrong with the stairs ?
avoid all contact day .
what ?
what is it ?
now you know who and what freddy really is .
i though freddy was just an old town story .
i will tell you later .
it is no just a house . it is his home . he is waiting there for me . . . to dream .
it is okay , babe . we are with you .
feeling better now ?
yeah . i guess so . . . what happened ?
i gotta get out of here .
you just stay put . you need rest .
you do not get it , he is after me . . .
excuse us , dear .
frankly , dear , we wondered what you intend to do with our baby ?
look , i appreciate what you are offering , but no . he is my responsibility .
in your present condition , alice , we are worried about your ability
we know you have been through a lot but there s more than your feelings at stake here .
hey . . . wake up .
should not you be in your room , jacob ?
it is lonely in there , in my room .
i am sorry your boyfriend got killed .
how did you know that ?
hi , you do not look very well . are you feeling all right ?
is that who you are waiting for ?
i do not think this is a nice place for you to be . maybe we should go find your mom .
she does not want me around
no you are not . you do not even care about being a mom . how come you do not think about me ?
who says i do not like you ?
mommy . . . ?
where is he ?
what do you mean ?
but how . . . ?
hi , beautiful .
jesus ! do not do that !
the tickets .
they are coach seats , but the plane lands in paris . it is gonna be a helluva summer , hon !
okay , babe . that is the matter ?
nothing . . . it is just . . . i did not see my father at the ceremony .
about him ?
you stopped it did not you ? it was probably just a regular bad dream .
yeah . . . i guess .
you do not dream him up , he cannot hurt you . or me . or us . remember . . .
you are right .
there you go . love you .
i was afraid you were not coming .
i watched from behind the stands . did not want to embarrass you , ya know . the drunk showed up , that kind of thing . . .
that is in the past . unless you have stopped going to the meetings .
dad !
where are we going ?
thanks for everything , dad .
you sure you do not want a ride to work ?
i am so sorry , honey . . .
how was the meeting ?
sobering . . .
very funny .
alice . . .
since when are you such a smart shopper ?
since my little girl became a mom . . .
you disappointed in me ?
alice !
i have got to go .
no ! i will not have you running around in the middle of the night . you are coming home .
but dad
hey , that is wrong with you let s see a smile .
had kind of a long night .
dan keeping you up again ? put a lock on that window , girl .
good to see you again , mr . grey . i have got to go find dan .
it was no accident . it was krueger . he used to get in through my dreams , but not anymore . he is found some other way .
have you visited the little boy on my floor ? jacob , the one who looks kind of sad ?
there are not any little boys on your floor .
did everyone call everyone ?
that is that got to do with it ?
it was just an accident . like with dan .
i do not understand that is happening . krueger has to use my dreams , but he got to dan and greta while i was awake . how is he doing it ?
you had me scared on the phone . that is wrong with the baby ?
oh , alice . . . no . honey , i love you but you are going to have to get a hold of yourself . . .
i really think you need to calm down now , okay ?
i am your friend , and i am worried sick about you . but , you are like a locked safe . you have gotta start dealing with reality .
krueger is reality .
and so is your baby . you have got more than just yourself to think of now !
all i know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman . why do not you take off leave springwood and cool out somewhere for a while ?
look . . . we are all tired . none of us had any sleep since friday night . . .
are you alright ?
you think that is the place she is buried ?
what ?
but how are we gonna
you do good work , alice .
he sure loves to stay awake .
give up , mark , it is hopeless .
not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis .
my dad s got this thing about drinking in the house .
i have got to write some of this down .
mark , are you okay ?
i want to talk to both you guys about greta . and . . .
i thought about that .
then get out !
do you think i am an idiot . . . for being in love with her ?
maybe it was her mother who killed her , with all that polly perfect shit .
tell me some more about this krueger guy .
who s jacob ?
my baby !
whoa , slow down . how are you gonna hide from a guy like that , leave the planet ?
where are you going ?
i could not do that , mark . he is my last link with dan . . . no , i want him .
they think i am nuts .
no , it is our problem , mark . if i do not deal with this , they really might try to take jacob . you said she committed suicide ?
that is what the newspapers thought . she spent the rest of her life in the asylum . after krueger s trial she flipped out and hung herself , so they thought .
they could not prove it . no body ! nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business .
but i have seen her grave .
poor woman . . .
i do not understand .
yeah , when are you gonna come to your senses ?
next life . oh , that is that ?
meet me later . milkshakes . cherry pie . banana splits . and no mom !
that club sucks , they card everybody . let s just party at your place .
he is right . sometimes i feel like i am living with melicertes .
who ?
oh man ! i could have gone all night without looking at that .
these things are wild . . . what do you think ?
all right kids , i tell you what we are gonna do . i have got swimming practice until six thirty today . . .
yeah . . .
have another one , sounds like you need it .
naah , i am done . got to be on shift in a couple hours . are not you going in ?
stop saying that , it is bullshit .
look . dangs parents were pushing him . pushing him hard . he was bitching about it at the party last night . he was under pressure . we all are .
bottom line , alice . anybody , supernatural or not , that wants to hurt you he will have to go through us first .
dan . and he is taking alice with him pretty good dive yvonne . you have been practicing .
vomit ?
why do not you shut up and let her talk ! two of us died in the last two days , does that strike you as particularly normal ? !
mark . . .
i am not finished i loved greta . a lot . and if maybe , just maybe , someone or some thing killed her , i would like to hear about it !
it is okay .
you , too ?
i should have suspectcd , when i heard that wouldoctor . i thought it was your father .
it was supposed to be . dad had a heart attack , two days ago .
how is he ?
it was moderate . he will be all right . but it was out of the question , his coming along .
you could train someone else .
what is it ?
your out . this came for you .
my father ! he is not ?
what did you mean i am out ?
you trade school boys are all alike , are not you ? anybody who does not happen to think like a little gold braided puppet is , ipso facto , a coward !
wearing a uniform does not bestow an automatic monopoly on courage , u commander u ! it just so happens i am u not u a coward physical or mental and before i would risk my father s life . . .
we are u all u risking our lives !
that may be . but dad stays where u he u is , and i am staying here !
you are really a mixed up oddball , are not you ?
perhaps . but the idea of willingly going to u school u to spend my u life u at a paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder lizards i am referring to war u that u strikes me as the u worst u cowardice of all being spiritually yellow !
you mean u nothing u is worth fighting for ?
peace the dignity of man the destiny of the human spirit ! show me a man who says you win u those u by fighting wars , and u i will u show you an idiot !
unidentified flying objects .
that is enough , holloway . i have told you before , wearing boards on your shoulders , and parading with a stiff spine does not auto matically endow you with back bone !
however our ideas disagree , as i have said before , i am u not u a coward ! and it happens you have got no choice either u i u take you down there , in the lungfish , or you do not get there
they are so remote cold beautiful , the stars . but now i wonder
yes ?
maybe just maybe when their ship does not return they will decide not to come here , after all .
but if they u do u ?
i do not know .
i would not worry . so long as we have boats like the tiger shark and people like you , the skipper , dave , kent , sir ian and my father
now , dave old buddy , you know you are exaggerating what do you think of this husband of yours ? on most boats a certain loyalty exists between the exec and his navigation and firing officer . but unfortunately , in the case of lieutenant dave milburn of the tiger shark and myself
but julie s a nice girl , and i have seen you work . she deserves a fighting chance !
reef !
so they caught up with you , too ?
at the worst possible moment . tomorrow is janie s birthday . poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her daddy home . now
u that is u the worst possible moment ?
what could be worse than disappoint ing a little girl ?
you have asked why i stay a bachelor ? there goes the best reason i know !
huh ?
i guess skipper neilsen re tired before you enrolled at the academy , did not he ?
i guess .
one of the finest men , and officers , alive . a real hero in the best sense of the word in world war two . he taught us engineering and design . fought like a demon to develop atom subs .
so ?
so all of a sudden his only son drops out of school , be gins making noises like a pacifist . a real egghead , do gooder , and crackpot ! ban the atom tests ! junk the nuclear subs ! spend the mili tary budgetfor peace !
but u they are u not skipper neilsengs son ! it broke his heart . then when some newspapers called carl the honest , sincere son of a war mongering father captain neilsen resigned from the navy . oh , he still keeps his hand in playing around with projects like the lungfish but it broke him , all the same .
have you ever talked to carl tried to see his side ?
cyclops ?
we are stuck tight !
you have got to let us try , skipper
us ?
you all wait here . i am going inside , take a look .
how about that ! the bow drove half through her , but she sealed herself right up .
that is more important there s our problem . the bow ram the sawteeth are holding the shark in the break . if we can cut the ram , the shark can pull herself loose !
i think you are right .
yeah ?
i do not hear anything . maybe you have been down here too long . why do not you go back up and
hey you know something ? it is getting lighter in here !
and if i did not u know u better i would swear we were moving !
you hear that ?
where do you think the voice you heard was coming from ?
somewhere down there ?
wonder where powell and carney are ?
well ?
here keep these . it wants me to come alone .
dave !
get ready . we shove off as soon as griff reports all the crew aboard .
is there any way out of it ?
seems to be all around . . .
what about down ?
course and speed ?
a mass of jelly like stuff came out of the thing , and caught our torpedo !
what course , skipper ?
you better take powell and carney with you
the frogmen ?
with their underwater experience , they will be invaluable . take sidearms , and flare pistols
sidearms ? but the saucer s dead .
excuse me , skipper
yes , griff ?
skipper could you take a look here . . . ?
something wrong ?
the inertial navigation system . must have been knocked out in the crash .
why do you say that ?
we are dead in the water . but it indicates we are moving !
we read you ! go ahead , doctor ! they are inside the saucer . it is filled with breathable air !
wonderful !
now they feel it . . . down below .
excuse me , captain there may be one last , desperate chance a one in a thousand shot . . .
anything
it is possible i could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the icbm so it would home on the saucer when he rises from the pole .
it does not seem possible , but could it be an electrical storm center ?
under u water u ?
. . . above murmansk , and finland .
suppose our theorizing is correct ? then this u could u be the next danger point !
we took for granted his source of energy was nuclear . but suppose it is not at all what if it is u magnetic u ?
u we u harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force . maybe cyclops does it on a u super u scale . . . .
. . . . in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and , as you put it . . . . . . . arecharging his batteries ?
the radiation level from the saucer it is rising !
as we near the pole . . .
there s got to be an explanation !
all ready ?
thought you were going to washington , skipper .
i did go . just back . reef , these are a couple of our passengers sir ian hunt , and dr . clifford kent . my exec , commander richard holloway .
i am afraid i have some bad news for you , reef you will have to share quarters , this trip .
who with ?
wouldoctor neilsen ? when did u that u happen ?
huh ?
what do you think ?
determine extent of damage , immediately .
you are sure it is cyclops ?
that is the running time ?
right u at u him ?
that is what i said !
but what can we accomplish ?
a hundred and eighty fathoms ! we cannot be sinking that fast . . . .
it is the screws , skipper . at our declination angle , running in reverse , they are pulling the shark u and u cyclops right to the bottom .
suppose there s an atmosphere , of some kind , inside cyclops ?
what ?
straight to the pole at almost fifty knots !
that is the corrected bearing to the magnetic pole ?
remove your weapons , commander . and come here alone !
that is a u face u ? ? ?
point of view is everything . to us , u your u form of life is ugly as we appear to you .
my mission is to study various solar systems , and planets select the most suitable for colonization
swell !
he did !
why not me ? what am i the closing act ?
on the contrary . i want you unharmed perfect .
why ?
it is a living thing . when damaged you would say wounded it immediately heals itself .
that is why no water leaked inside when we rammed you ?
to navigate , will not you have to . . . see your way ?
obviously .
my yeoman will show you to your quarters .
see what ?
well , i will be !
just musing about our one eyed adversary and the legend of homer . cyclopes were the sons of heaven , who forged the thunder bolts thrown by zeus .
you plotted the course of cyclops ? then that is u our u course ! wherever u he u goes , u we u go . . . . . until we get him !
we have asked ourselves that over and over a thousand times .
due north . at five knots . . . no , six !
cyclops will have to linger at the pole to recharge his power banks .
you got yourself a computer , alma .
been putting my files into it . you take sugar and milk ?
are you alright , wade ?
yeah , sure . why ? i got this damned tooth , i got a few things bugging me , like everybody else . but i am okay .
well , you look . . . sad . upset . i do not mean to pry . i am sorry about your mother . it was a nice funeral .
alma , i think there s some dirty business going on in this town .
always has been .
this is maybe worse than you and i are used to . what i am talking about , i am talking about murder . among other things .
who ?
evan twombley , the union boss who got shot . somebody murdered him .
who ?
. . . if jack told the truth , he could be free by the time he is my age .
sometimes things are simpler than you think . let me ask you a question .
you do not believe me ?
about jack ? no . have you checked out the tax bill on your father s farm lately ?
i know he is due for the last two years . i was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in .
has anybody offered to buy it ?
this is from three years ago . some difference , huh ?
what is the northcountry development association ?
i went down to concord to check it out . the president is mel gordon . the vice president and treasurer is gordon lariviere . those boys are buying up the mountain , wade . , this year . i believe that is out of lariviere s league .
twombley involved ?
no .
he musta found out . they had to get rid of him . and jack will get blamed .
what are you boys up to ?
the good news is we have not got to your car yet . the bad news
just tell me when you will have it fixed .
the bad news is there s a problem with gordongs truck what somebody drove through the ice last night . figured you would know something about that , wade .
yeah . i know about that .
lariviere says he ai not gonna pay for the fixing of your car . a couple hundred for the clutch . i got some more bad news . wanna hear it ?
tell me .
chub says you are fired .
he cannot fire me . lariviere already did that this morning .
i screwed up the divorce . i agreed with everything she said . i wanted her to like me . i just want to be a good father .
it would help if you were married , if there was someone at home while you work .
i plan to . soon .
how soon ?
this spring .
good . it would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex wife . sexual problems upsetting to the child .
it looks pretty hopeless , do not it ?
no , not exactly . i will look at the divorce decree , see if we can get it redrawn . interview your daughter . jill , right ?
yes .
fine . i will need a retainer . you can mail it .
jesus . how much . . . how much will the whole thing cost ?
hard to say . if we go for custody , depositions , psychiatric evaluations , it could drag on . ten or twelve thousand dollars . she could win on appeal . if we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn , assuming they are unduly restrictive , it would not be more than twenty five hundred .
oh .
you might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the
you heard the news .
i hear twombley got shot .
you see it ?
nope . heard it . we was not far apart . i spotted this buck , then i heard the gun go off and twombley was gone . i looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was , deader n shit . called it right in .
might as well take the rest of the day off . you look sort of fucked up . you have been paid for the day , anyhow , right ?
not exactly . i mean , he never paid me .
you will get your money . do not talk to any newspapers about this . twombley s a big deal down in massachusetts , you know . tell them your lawyer says you should not comment .
lawyer ? i do not need no lawyer , do i ?
he is on to us !
shit ! what are we gonna do ?
maybe i can buy him off . i gotta talk to mel .
you cannot buy wade off .
we bought you .
it is not enough snow , not for tracking the bastards . no advantage there , kid .
do not worry , mr . twombley , i know where those suckers are . rain or shine , snow or no snow . i know deer . we will kill us a buck today . guaranteed . before ten .
guaranteed , eh ?
yep . right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles . the bucks are right behind them and we are right behind the bucks . this gun gets fired before ten o clock . whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you . i will put you inside , yards of a buck the first four hours of the season . that is what you are paying me for , ai not it ?
done much shooting with that rifle yet ?
tell you what . you get me close to a big buck by ten , kid , there s another hundred bucks in it .
if you get it ?
yeah .
you might not kill it .
you think so .
you might gut shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag . cannot guarantee that will not happen , especially with a new gun . i may have to shoot it .
you take care of your end , kid , i will take care of mine .
mmm .
you understand what i am saying ? i want a deer , a dead one , not a cripple or whatthefuck .
i get it . no sweat . you will get yourself a deer and you will get him dead . and you will have him by coffee time .
and you will get your extra hundred bucks .
i am okay .
i used to play ball .
yeah ?
drafted by the red sox .
you played for the sox ?
double a . new britain .
oh .
pitcher . best ballplayer to come out of new hampshire since carlton fisk .
really .
they said .
hmm .
the only difference between me and that clemens on tv is luck , shit luck .
what happened ?
safety on ?
yeah .
this way .
sungs gettin high .
fresh tracks . deer shit . big one . here s your buck , mr . twombley . i will circle around .
do not mind if i do .
lariviere s having a hell of a time in there . master of fucking ceremonies .
no brag . just fact .
i thought i told you to move that truck !
relax , chief . we are leaving . you wanna toke ?
you gotta be more careful about that shit . gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they will expect me to bust you . and i will be outta a job .
some job . here , have a hit . do not be such a hardass . i know you got problems , but everybody s got problems .
got a job first thing in the morning , first day of season . saturday i will hunt for myself . twombley something . er
evan . he is a mucky muck union official from massachusetts . you are lucky .
do not know about lucky . the guy s a full blown asshole . pay s good , though . a day . i got to guarantee a kill , of course . which i can do . there s some monster bucks hiding out up there .
how would you get the job ?
like you and gordon ?
right . the sonofabitch could not get along without me .
yeah , he would go broke tomorrow if you quit him .
bastard s got his high beams on .
aw , shit , she is here to get jill . me and jill had a little argument . jack , i got to get back , get back to town . move this thing , will you ? see if you can get back to the town hall before they get there , okay ?
where would twombley get shot ?
in the chest .
no , i mean whereabouts .
a half mile in , along the old lumber road .
you bring him up yourself ? that is a steep climb .
the ambulance guys lugged him up .
you stayed away ?
yeah .
where would you get the blood ?
what blood ?
on your sleeve .
musta . . . how would i know ? what are you doing , playing cop ?
i gotta make a report to fish and game . i was just wondering , that is all . what would he do , to shoot himself , i mean ?
who the fuck knows ? musta slipped or something . i just heard the gun go off .
i never seen a man shot before . not even in the service . must be something .
well , i did not actually see him do it . like i said .
sure you did .
what ?
saw him do it ?
what the fuck you telling me , wade ? i never seen the guy get shot , i told you that .
you musta seen him get shot . i know you did .
there s your old twenty gauge , and that there s the new browning you was showing me last night . this must be twombley s gun . brand new . very fancy tooling . probably fired one time . it is a beautiful piece of work . but what the hell , jack , i guess you deserve it . right s right .
yeah .
twombley sure as hell will not be shooting it again .
i am fucking out of here .
lawford ?
open the door , will ya ?
why do not you quit now , you want out so bad ?
open the door . we are late .
i mean it you got enough money now . head out for california . surf s up , jack , and you are digging wells in the snow .
i am sorry for the screw up . but i could not help it it is too late to go trick or treating now . i could not help it i had to stop at penny s for the costume . and you were hungry , remember .
who s fault is it then if it is not yours ? you are the one in charge , daddy .
yeah .
those are the hoyts .
i do not care . they are out .
why do they do that ?
do what ?
you know .

yeah . it is stupid .
i guess they are stupid .
did you do that when you were a kid ?
well , yeah . sort of . nothing really mean . me and my pals , me and my brothers . it was kind of funny then . stealing pumpkins , soaping windows . stuff like that .
was it funny ?
to us it was .
but it is not funny now .
it is not funny now . i am a cop and i gotta listen to all the complaints people make . i am not a kid anymore . you change .
i bet you did lots of bad things .

okay .
please do not cry . please , honey .
what are you sorry for ?
i do not know . for the food business . i guess . i just thought , you know , we would sneak a big mac on mommy , like we used to .
i want to go home .

i know .
you are a policeman .
nope . not anymore . i am nothing anymore .
jill , please , it is alright . nothing happened .
i want to go home .
we are looking for the funniest costume ! and the scariest ! and the most imaginative ! and the best costume of all !
tomorrow , gordon .
told you the snow was coming down . take the grader .
where is the plow ?
jimmy took it . jack s out hunting with evan twombley .
his son in law damn near killed me .
huh ?
at the school crossing . in his bmw . coulda hurt some kids . i am gonna bust his ass .
do not go playing policeman .
what am i a security guard ? you hired me , you and your selectman friends .
you do not want the extra police pay ?
i am not saying that .
get the grader . go out past toby s . do not let lillian get to you . she did not belong here . that is why she left .
fuck you .
that is the hurry ?
a hunting accident . jack and twombley .
huh ?
i figured you already heard .
fuck . turn it off . all you heard was there was some kinda accident ?
twombley s shot . i heard that . not jack . he is okay , i assume .
fuck . you do not know how bad or anything ?
you mean twombley ?
he more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something . that is what usually happens .
i shoulda sent you instead of jack .
i wish you had . i would rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader .
you ai not the hunter jack is . and he cannot drive the grader worth shit .
that must have been twombley . jesus . i bet that was twombley .
you want me to follow them to littleton ?
what the fuck . my day s already ruined . give me the keys . you can go back with jack . you still got a shitload of plowing to do .
it ai not done , if that is what you mean .
something bugging you ?
yeah . a few things .
how you holding up , wade ?
i am fine , fine .
sorry about the long lunch . my clutch is going out again .
you ever think of getting a new car , wade ?
on what you pay me ?
what do i have to do for it ?
nothing , wade , i have been thinking . you do not get enough appreciation around here and it is time we changed things a little .
i saw mel gordon in here this morning .
so ?
he say anything about the summons i tried to give him ? sonofabitch would not accept it .
wade , that was not smart . going out right after the mangs father in law shot himself . let it go . call it a favor to me .
you ? why ?
mel s doing some business with me . it is nice to do favors for people you do business with . he was in a hurry . no big deal .
that was before twombley was shot . before he knew .
that is the difference ? take my truck , take a rest stop worrying about mel gordon . have you decided what to do with your old mangs place he going to stay there ?
want to buy ?
do not light that in here . i am allergic .
i will not . you interested ?
maybe .
you and mel gordon ?
could be .
wade , you are done . let me have the shop keys .
you two , do not you get it ? he is using you . you are his slaves . jesus christ , jack , do not you see that ?
the key , wade .
lillian !
me and jill , we just had a little spat . she felt kind of left out , i guess , from not knowing some of the new kids
while you went off for a few beers with your friends ? is that hettie rodgers there , with whatzizname ?
yeah .
she is grown up some , has not she ?
i do not want her to go , lillian .
do not cause a scene . no one s trying to win any rounds . do not make it any worse .
you ever come to your father s grave anymore ?
no , not anymore . it is too . . . it is too far .
we should talk .
we have done all our talking , wade .
it is just . . .
wait there . she will be right out . is there snow on the ground up in lawford ?
yeah , lots .
see . get your boots .
no problem . look , i . . .
you make me sick . i cannot believe you have sunk so low .
low as what ? what have i done ? it is bad to want to see your own daughter ?
are you okay , wade ? what was wrong ? why were you holding everyone up ?
did you see that sonofabitch in the bmw ? he could have killed somebody .
did you get his number ?
i know who it is .
good . who ?
mel gordon .
i still do not understand
new hat ? jill s up , i see .
for a while .
how is she doing ?
okay . she is fine .
do not worry . i can protect my virtue . i mean , c mon , wade , give me a break .
see you tomorrow , maybe .
you okay ?
you okay ?
yeah .
i am sorry about what i said .
said what ?
about you and jill and needing a third person . she went back to lillian ?
forget it .
i am sorry .
you do not mean that .
yeah . i mean that .
no you do not . you are pissed , that is all . you ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with lillian . you know ? work it out with her , tell her how you feel . lilliangs not out to get you .
call me .
tonight . let s get together .
jack s sort of sensitive , i guess . more than most . but he will be okay in a few weeks .
there s something funny about that shooting . there s lots funny about it , actually .
i heard he was drunk at toby s last night and got in a fight with hettie . he drove off without her . . .
i am sure , i am positive it did not happen the way jack says it did .
. . . jack s turned into one of those men who are permanently angry . he used to be a sweet kid , but it is like , when he found out he could not play ball anymore , he changed . now he is like everyone else .
i have been wondering if maybe jack shot twombley , instead of twombley shooting himself . i have been wondering maybe jack shot him on purpose .
money .
jack does not need money .
everybody needs money . except guys like twombley and that sonofabitch son in law of his . people like that .
jack would not kill for it . besides , who would pay him ?
lots of people . guy like evan twombley , boston union official , probably got lots of people want to see him dead . the government s been investigating his links with the mafia .
the mafia hire jack hewitt ?
no , i just know jack s lying about what happened . he just seemed i know that kid , what he is like inside . he is a lot like i was at his age .
you would not have done anything like that , shot someone for money .
no . not for money . but , if somebody would given me half a damned excuse i was pretty fucked up , you know .
i can see what you looked like as a kid .
you knew me as a kid .
yeah , but never what you looked like . not really . never really studied your face , like now . i was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now , this way .
what way ?
after making love . i like it . it is nice to see that in a grown up person .
do not you think , do you still think it is a good idea to press this custody thing just now ?
i am her father supposed to be , but i am not able to . yes . yes , i am . it may be the only thing in my life i have been so clear about wanting . even if it takes a big fight .
then . . . i guess you have to .
there s another thing i have been thinking about . i do not know how you feel about the idea , margie , because we have never talked about it . but i have been thinking lately , i have been thinking we should get married sometime . you and me .
oh , wade .
i have been thinking about it , that is all .
you have been married twice
it was to the same woman . i was just a kid . . . it is not like a marriage proposal or anything , just a thought . something for you and me to talk about and think about . you know ?
alright . i will think about it .
did you tell them ? that we were coming ?
do not you think it is proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents ?
i know your parents .
are you sure they are home ? did you call ?
strange .
think they are alright ?
of course ! i would have heard .
how ?
this is nuts .
what happened ?
what on earth is happening to you ? why are you acting this way ?
it is my tooth ! my fucking tooth ! i cannot even think anymore because of it .
i heard you talking . you got fired this morning , did not you ?
going somewhere , margie ?
i am just cleaning out some of this stuff that is built up . for the rummage sale . and some things for the cleaners . and the laundromat .
do not lie to me . you are leaving me , i can see that .
have you been heating the house ? not just with the stove .
there s a furnace .
you are not using it today ?
it is broke i guess . there s an electric in the bedroom .
coffee s perked .
when did she die ?
it makes me sad .
can ?
whitehouse . next time , phone ahead .
i said , next time , phone ahead .
jesus christ . mr . gordon , when i come all the way to serve somebody a summons , i do not call ahead for an appointment .
what the hell are you talking about ?
i am issuing you a ticket . moving violation .
moving violation ! i just got out of bed and you are telling me you are giving me a goddamn speeding ticket ? now ? are you nuts ? is that it , whitehouse ? you are nuts ?
yesterday morning , you passed a stopped school bus , which was flashing its lights , then you
hold on !
do not ever put your hands on me , mr . gordon .
you are talking about a goddamned ticket , from when i passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something ?
do not give me a hard time , mr . gordon . i am just
doing your fucking job . i know . i watch television too .
yes . here s your ticket .
who are you ?
i was . . . i am wade whitehouse . i was wondering , is your husband here ?
he is asleep . we were up very late .
well , yes , i am . . . i want to say that i am real sorry about your father , mrs . twombley .
mrs . gordon . thank you .
well , yeah , i suppose . sure . i just had a little business to settle with mr . gordon . i am the local police officer .
something about my father ?
oh , no . no , it is a . . . it is a traffic thing . no big deal .
take care , wade .
it do not look right .
what ?
the sign . it looks like it is spelled wrong or something .
fuck . wade whitehouse . it is people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering . whatever somebody does to improve things around here , you gotta find fault with it .
i am not finding fault . it is a good idea , good for you , good for the town . real modern too .
this town sucks .
marg !
that goddamned woman . thinks she can cart jill off and leave me alone like this . i am more than pissed , margie . i am a whole lot more than pissed . i been that plenty and i know the difference . this is different .
you talked to jack ?
not since last night . he took a guy hunting .
the fucker shot himself . ker bang ! that is what it sounds like . not on purpose . i assume accidental .
jack ?
the other guy .
where . . . how would you hear that ?
cb . little while ago . one of the boys on the way in picked up jack on the cb calling for state troopers . i figured you would know what really happened . the fucking guy kill himself ? this twombley , who the fuck is he , anyhow ?
jillie , you want a cheese grilled sandwich ?
wade , i got a message for you . jack hewitt , he is looking for you . wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in town hall .
his office . you mean my old office .
well , i guess that is what he said .
he got his deer yet ?
rolfe .
just do it .
what was that ? you got something to say , say it ! say it !
nothing .
jesus , pop , how can you stand the cold , dressed like that ? where is ma ?
sleeping .
you remember margie fogg ?
from wickham s . been a while . like some coffee ?
how you and ma doing ? have not seen you in town for a while .
we are alright . your ma s sleeping . you want me to get her ?
where is ma ?
yeah .
i checked on her . she had the electric heater . cold do not bother her as much as me . which is why i give her the heater .
is there something wrong with the phone ?
in the living room .
why did not you call and have the furnace fixed ?
listen , it is no big deal , pop .
pop , for christ s sake !
you ! by christ , you i know you . yeah , you goddamn sonofabitch , i know you . you are a goddamn fucking piece of my heart !
you do not know me . you do not know me ! so fuck you . fuck you .
love ! what the fuck do you know about love ?
love ! i am made of love !
call it what you want .
everything you know is from me .
yeah .
bang !
where the christ you going ? you sonofabitch , you leave my fucking truck where it is ! i need . . . give me the goddamn keys ! i need to get me to town !
crawl !
nothing in the fucking house to drink . not a fucking thing . my house , my money , my truck stolen !
rolfe .
wade ?
yeah , brother , look , i was calling cause has there been anything on tv in boston about a hunting accident with a guy named twombley , evan twombley ?
there was something . it happened up your way .
yeah , i know him the kid that was with him . maybe you do too . jack hewitt . he works for lariviere with me . he is my best friend .
wade , it is late . i know you are probably at toby s , but i am in bed reading . we got different habits .
it will come out jack lied and the kid will get hung for it .
he was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in new england and the construction business .
who ?
twombley .
no shit .
you think jack shot him ?
well , it was an accident .
lillian was here . in lawford .
huh ?
the night before the shooting .
how was she ?
picked up jill . she was supposed to visit for the weekend for halloween . she wanted to go home .
who ?
jill . i was thinking of getting a lawyer . maybe you can help me .
what happened ?
do not think about it . you are exhausted .
yeah , i guess .
get some sleep .
i get to feeling like a whipped dog some days , rolfe , and some night i am going to bite back . i swear it .
have not you already done a bit of that ?
pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do , i guess .
anyone else want one ? rolfe ?
no thanks . i do not drink .
what about margie ?
what about her ?
well , do you still plan to get married ?
i want to let the gas run out . i do not want the bastard driving drunk , and he is always drunk now . after , we will hide the keys .
anything new about the shooting ? twombley ?
i guess it was an accident , like everybody thinks .
find them everywhere .
i think your first response to the twombley shooting was the correct one .
which is ?
that it was not an accident .
then who shot him ?
well , your friend , i think . jack hewitt .
motive . you gotta have a motive .
money .
who would pay him that kind of money ? not the mob . they got their own guys . specialists .
they would not deal with a guy like jack . who else benefits if twombley is suddenly dead ?
i do not know . you tell me .
okay . it is likely there are people in the union who do not want twombley to testify . they probably include his son in law who s vice president and will probably be the next president . i read that in the papers . that is his name , mel gordon ?
yeah , the guy with the bmw i told you about . i did , did not i ?
here s my theory . twombley , unaware of illegal union loans or whatever , starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out . finds out his son in law is involved .
so mel gordon would not want a professional hit . that would make the feds dig deeper . he wants an accident .
a hunting accident is perfect .
it is too neat . things ai not that neat . it makes me mad . that somebody can pay to kill somebody , his own father in law , and not be punished for it . do not that piss you off ?
not particularly .
right s right , goddamnit ! do not you care that is right ?
i was thinking about that story you told me , about pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after .
yeah .
i hate to disappoint you , but i do not think it happened .
of course it happened . why would i lie about it ?
it may have happened , but not the way you said .
you think i would not remember a thing like that ?
it was not me . i was not there , but i heard about it . when i heard about it , it was about elbourne .
we would have to go digging in vietnam to ask him .
and elbourne and mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft .
well , i never heard that one .
i remember clearly cause when i heard i became real careful around pop . i was a careful child and i became a careful adult , but at least i was not afflicted by that mangs violence .
then you accidentally see your body , or your face , or whatever , and you do not know who the hell it belongs to . strange . it is the business with the old man , i know , and how incredibly pissed i was at him , and also chasing jack hewitt like that , and the goddamned truck going through the ice , not to mention margie s being so upset one thing on top of another .
wade , are you alright ?
i know what it means . i am just running out of ways to use it .
to help , jack , of course and to nail those sonsofbitches , the two gordons . that is what alma calls them . jesus , rolfe , whose side are you on ?
it is not like he has not made us wait a few times .
well , you are not the president , dear .
you do not want to say hi to your father ?
i am sure he is busy .
hey joey , how bout a cocoa , double whip cream .
alice . . .
mom , just this once , give it a rest .
you are jet lagged . we will talk about this back . . .
we will talk at home . you know , most girls are not as lucky as you . for most girls seeing the bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime .
he is in a meeting . he cannot be disturbed .
i am sorry , honey .
when i write my memoirs i think i will devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard air force one .
your father never means to be so . . .
i know . . . but lotsa times i feel like it is me versus the world . some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in bangladesh . i mean it does not take a genius to figure which is more important .
some kids were teasing you ?
you are right and i will tell you a secret . i know exactly how you feel .
mom ?
yes dear ?
daddy . daddy , please . . .
i do not drink coffee .
you must be tired . it will wake you up .
you are one of stravanavitch s men .
so , you study world events , little one . that is good for a girl your age .
yeah , i study world events . five thousand turkienistan muslims were slaughtered in stravanvitch s cleansings . . . along with american school kids . you know hqw i studied that . i went to their funerals with my dad . i met their parents .
smart for your age , eh ? top of your class ? tell me , do you know what the word quot propaganda quot means ?
the woman you shot . she was my friend .
fuck off , you stupid asshole .
he did not leave us .
oooooh , i am good .
how was . . . . . . the ballet ?
it was the experience of a lifetime .
alice !
daddy . . .
how you doing , sweetie ?
oh ny god . . . oh my god . . . oh my god . . .
there they are !
the americans say they are escorting a damaged plane . our pilots confirm they are surrounding a .
did we warn them off ?
it is some kind of trick . . . a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement .
they are in our airspace . we would be within our rights .
the pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet .
do you see the maintenance panel ?
got it .
pop it open . there should be a red switch , toggle it up .
okay , it is on . we have got some indicator lights here .
it is cut .
u . s . pilots , this is air force one .
mr . president , it is an honor . now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here .
you read my mind .
put your pilot on .
who s flying the fucking plane ?
two and three are heading toward the boeing .
okay . we are gonna arc a fat one to the right . got it ?
got it .
how we doing , colonel ?
uh , we got a problem here .
just stay on my wing , sir . i will take you all the way in .
no . we are losing fuel and my rudder s not responding .
aw , man . you are torn up pretty bad out here , sir . do you have any elevater control .
sluggish . . . i think it is jammed too .
he is dead then . they must have killed him .
we do not know that .
walter , if you have a point , make it .
they are not answering their hails .
they have got no chutes . they cannot control the plane , their engines are failing and they are losing fuel .
i prefered the terrorists .
sir , you threw out page two .
goddamn right i did . i asked for a tough as nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit . that is the point in having a speech if i have to ad lib ?
it was a good ad lib , sir .
apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders is not as popular as we thought it would be . representative taylor is working on a compromise .
the iraqi ambassador is claiming it is just an exercise .
general greely says it looks like the middle east .
can we do that ?
but they start executing hostages in
i hate to be pragmatic , but they will sacrifice pawns before kings . it may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff .
they still have the president , it is past their deadline and they have not called . what do you think it means ?
if challenged , our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission .
iraqi s will not buy it . either they are already in on this or they will think we are spying .
the chief justice ? what on earth for ?
special agent gibbs . you helped do this ?
yes , mr . president .
why ?
because it is my duty .
you are duty to what ? the country you served does not exist anymore .
air force one , this is af ra . we have been instructed to refuel your plane .
about goddamn time .
please change course to zero seven four and drop to eighteen thousand feet . over .
air force one , please reduce speed to knots .
that is affirmative .
we have already been inspected .
the rest of the secret service ?
dead .
how many others killed ?
nine .
who did this ?
we checked the manifest . everyone was accounted for .
remarkable aircraft . remarkable .
why did they do that ?
psychology . they are trying to unnerve us .
how ?
avionics compartment ! it is the only place . you better get zedeck down there fast unless , of course , you would rather be a martyr than a savior .
we have stopped dumping . . . but we have only got about twenty minutes of fuel left .
we are not going to make it .
not even close . hell , we cannot even make syria or iraq .
where are we now ?
over the black sea . i can probably get us to turkey or georgia .
tower , air force one has been boarded .
romeo tango zulu , do you have the president ? over .
stand by .
we copy . stand by . . . tower ?
tower , here .
this is romeo tango zulu changing call signs . tower , alert air traffic , romeo tango zulu is now air force one . this is air force one . . . the president is safe onboard .
ms . mitchell . so nice to finally meet you in person .
up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the mission communication center . the mcc , as we call it , can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth . we are linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations . we could run the country or run a war from there if we had to .
this is a remarkable aircraft .
you do not know the half of it . did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation ? we could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary .
a dubious distinction , no ?
and all these rooms here ?
here s a press kit . i will let you guys get comfortable and once we are airborne i will be able to schedule the interviews .
please tell me your name .
maria . . . maria mitchell .
i am responsible for press relations for the flight office .
how are your fellow hostages feeling , ms . mitchell ?
you are pointing a gun at me .
fear will keep you alive . any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish , and bound to die .
what do you want with us ?
now , or he dies , please .
leave my daughter alone .
or you will do what , mrs . marshall ? but i admire your courage . your husband , on the other hand . . .
what do you know of my husband ?
i know he left you behind .
my husband is a very courageous man .
do you have to be so brutal ?
yes
why ? do you enjoy it ?
i neither enjoy nor dislike . i do what is necessary .
but they are not ny people . you look at me as if i am a monster , but answer me this when your planes bombed the oil fields of iraq , did you cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who s faces you will never see ? did you cry for their wives and children . they were people too , yes . . . but they were not your people .
that was war .
shall i begin by executing the president s daughter ? she is right here .
no .
nor will there be . my husband does not negotiate with terrorists .
the world is such a dangerous place and we cannot always protect our children .
four . . .
jim . . .
you got what you wanted . you going to release us now ?
now since we have had very little luck getting washington or moscow to cooperate , i wondered if you would be so kind .
over my dead body .
she is not a part of this . this is between you and me .
this administration does not negotiate with terrorists .
stop .
you will do it ?
yes , i will do it . just leave my family alone .
someday , you will regret my nature .
the taste of defeat is bitter , no ?
there goes your ride .
let my daughter go or i will take you out !
no you will not . you will compromise . . . like always .
our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground . our hands are completely tied while they are in the air .
okay , gentlemen , we will take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane . . . lee , go huddle with the d . o . d . i want an options paper on this in minutes .
twenty minutes ?
madame vice president . we have an options paper . chandler takes the options paper , waves off lee , and reads it as she talks .
finally , we can bargain .
our kh ll s took this one at hours . what you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades .
the northern border s gotten a bit hairy . their migs are playing tag with our tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage .
mr . caidwell , the ground s a few miles away . how do you propose getting us from here to there ?
we have already played our cards , major . there s no turning back .
we cannot jump from here or at this speed . but if we could get a message out tell the refueling plane . . .
get em ready . you . . . come with me .
eighteen thousand feet , sir . and two hundred knots . . . otherwise it is suicide .
i will not going without my family .
sir , we stay with the president .
may i speak to you for a moment ?
cannot it wait ?
do not . i know spin control when i feel it .
for godsakes , jim , slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy . not even you can plug all the world s leaks . do not you think it is a sign you are pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on mtv news than in person .
she is a big girl . she understands .
how do you know she understands ? you have not spent more than five minutes with her , or me , in weeks .
you know what ?
what ?
i miss you . and i miss her .
but that is the point , jim . we are right here .
i will make it up to you , i promise .
i should trust that promise ? because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut .
how did your speech go ?
look on the bright side , hon . shep here thinks i will be a one termer .
i do not know why you stayed .
call petrov . . . i will be back .
what are you doing ?
flying the plane .
the fax machines .
excuse me ?
the fax machines .
no good . i said they disabled the communications system .
where are we sending it ?
someone should give you a raise .
did they say anything about my family ?
they are still alive , but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes .
and if that means negotiating . . .
you know my policy . we do not negotiate with terrorists . if we start now , all of america becomes a target .
please , mr . president . you are going to get yourself killed . is that your solution ?
that is going on ?
we are under attack .
where is my family ?
one .
but . . .
white house switchboard . how may i direct your call .
okay listen , listen carefully . this is an emergency call from air force one . who s there ? is the vice president there ?
who can i say is calling ?
this is the president .
yeah , right .
do not cut me off . this is an emergency .
sir , the president does not call this particular number . so whoever you are get a life , before i have this call traced .
okay . . . if you are the president , whengs your wife s birthday ?
look lady , i do not have time for games . just put the . . . .
thank you for calling the white house . . .
cbs said they will give us four minutes . they thought the russian was a nice touch .
you wanna knock of f ?
no , no . i am fine . what did the speaker say ?
with all due respect , sir , maybe you should give them this one . your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail stravanavitch .
i might still have a few chips left .
we could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge . the second amendment types will love that .
this is a crime bill , shep . killing a couple ducks will not get it through committee . besides , shep , i told you . . . i do not shoot babies and i do not kiss guns .
other way around , sir .
it is bait . do not take it .
sir , the speaker of the house attacked this administration on national television . you cannot afford to leave that hanging .
i said it is not worth the fight . steward , please .
you give me ulcers .
defense and state department in the conference room in one hour . i want to review the iraq situation .
mr . president . . . they are ready for you in the conference room .
mr . president , how the hell did you get on board ?
shepherd .
my god . i think that was a mig .
iraq , sir . we are over iraq .
shit .
how long s it been since you flew , sir ?
twenty five minutes . they should be here any moment .
it is open !
we are hooked !
commissioner , we both know the mercury shuttle needs another month of pre launch testing .
and what do the boys on the board know about safety , commissioner ? let u me u talk to them .
you handle your front office people , i will handle the press and leave the boys in washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board .
what ?
that is right , commissioner . senselessly murdered just minutes ago .
that just does not make any sense .
i wonder how your boys in washington are going to take this one .
i told you , leave the boys in washington to the boys downtown and the boys down . . .
forget it . i was reading .
i was reading too .
that is the story ?
some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor . . .
kruger , sagittarius .
did you feel that ?
yes i did . . .
felt like a large asteroid .
yes it did . mr . dunn , can i ask you a personal question ?
what is it , mary ?
oveur .
shut down accelerators .
we seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four , sir .
sir , i have got an overload in disposal unit four .
dunn .
sir ?
elaine .
te . . . !
it is got to be stopped !
but , ted , the invitations have already gone out .
ted , that is wrong ?
ted , you are overworked . you have been flying yourself into the ground .
there s nothing wrong with me !
let s relax tonight , just the two of us . i will make a quiet italian dinner just the way you like it , with spaghetti .
elaine .
elaine , what happened to us ?
eat this spaghetti , ted . it will make you feel a lot better .
who s that , ted ?
elaine , when are you going to realize simon kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way .
his name s david stockman . he is been here twenty years , that is all he says .
no goodbyes , elaine . just go .
if that is the way you want it .
that is the way i want it . just turn the radio on and go .
ted ! what are you . . . ?
ted , we are taking off !
what are you doing , ted ?
ted .
not now , elaine !
elaine .
ted . i do not know why you got on this flight . i do not know what you are trying to prove .
elaine , we have to go back .
we cannot go back . we had something very special , but it is all over .
ted , get a grip on yourself . you should never have left the hospital .
then you u do u think i am insane .
i have never used the word insane , ted .
what word would you use , elaine ?
the word is sick . ted very , very , very sick .
what would you say if i told you the toilet just blew up in my face .
i would use the word insane .
there s something dangerously wrong with this ship , elaine . i know its the wiring . that toilet s just the tip of the iceberg .
elaine !
ted !
elaine , that is going on ?
elaine , i am going back there . just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can .
ted , we have only got ten minutes .
not now , elaine .
kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place . you people knew this ship was not ready to fly . you played god with over a hundred lives , kruger , and for what the prestige of your precious space program .
well , elaine , this might be it if those guys on the ground do not think of something .
i just want you to know , i love you ted and always will .
simon just ejected !
sit down , elaine . if this bomb trick works we just might make it . simon was a fool to eject now .
you mean . . .
that is right premature ejection .
what will happen to him , ted ?
are you afraid ?
not when i am with you , ted .
we have blown the computer ! elaine ! set course change !
set !
now !
ted , the lever !
ted seemed to get worse after i told him about simon , doctor .
so you see , our task is not made any easier by ted s refusal to admit that he is sick .
you can eat balanced meals , exercise , and take geritol .
i mean for ted .
you can be gentle with him , elaine . he is been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden .
the brain is an amazingly complex organ , elaine .
is he making any progress , doctor ?
for the best little computer officer on the mercury mission .
simon .
who would believe that elaine thompson was once a stewardess on the denver chicago run .
women u and u the space program have come a long way , sweetheart . but after the wedding , no more complicated computers for my little girl .
but , darling , they have offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the jupiter probe .
frank s the best pilot in the program .
i am so excited , simon .
i guess this is a first for you .
elaine ! ted s a danger to himself , he is a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the middle east .
simon , why has he become so . . . so . . .
meet me onboard , sweetheart . i have to pick up a few things at the drugstore .
have you got it straightened out now ?
i think so .
simon , i am going to check rok s secondary readout unit .
simon , that is happening ? !
he tried to disconnect rok . it gassed him . that computer is running this ship and we are heading right for the sun .
cannot we change course ?
my career is shot .
simon , i did not want it to end like this . we can be friends ! you will die out there .
maybe .
elaine , ask rok for a field interference scan . those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications .
i do not think we have any alternative , captain .
i see . what do you think our alternatives are ?
roger .
you can do it from up here , captain .
i would rather sit down for this one , elaine .
no , i mean you can do it from the cockpit .
intermitant failure in scan mode r . analyze .
negative .
that does not make sense . repeat analysis .
negative .
that is not possible .
elaine , i am sorry about that little outburst a moment ago .
that is okay , rok .
can i say something of a personal nature to you ?
go ahead .
request comprehensive electrical systems check .
systems check positive . look , elaine , i . . .
request life support systems check .
life support check . elaine , it is obvious you have been ignoring me . you are a woman . i can relate to that .
request self analysis of rok hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes .
will scraps be able to sit with us , dad ?
i sure an glad they let scraps ride up here with us .
i bet scraps is going to love mercury .
do you think things will be a lot different on mercury , dad ?
how many kids get a chance to live on another planet .
no more kids yelling , your old mangs a thieving rapist ?
come on up , jimmy . say , that is some puppy . that is his name ?
scraps .
can i hold him ?
sure .
he is a boy dog .
yeah .
take this , joey . it is my last few bucks . you will need a hot meal when you get there .
we have spent everything on these operations . is it really worth it ? we have pawned your mother s wedding ring . the kids have no winter clothes . . .
joey , that is more important , the kids clothes or your sexual potency .
i do not want to hear that word !
okay , joey . the doc says you gotta relax . this hospital in des moines is the best sex clinic in the country .
all right . here .
joe , you do not want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people .
i do not want to live anymore .
joe , the insurance policy will not help your wife and kids . you bought auto insurance , not life insurance .
what ?
that is right , joe . now , no one s going to hurt you and no one has to know that is wrong with you .
you are sure ?
a couple eggs and juice would be nice , mary . over .
how would you like your eggs , captain ? over .
no . poached . over .
poached u and u over , captain oveur ? over .
that is how i want them . poached . over .
all right , captain oveur . over .
captain , the coffee machine is jammed and i do not like it .
which passenger is joe salucci ?
sixteen c , why ?
he is carrying a bomb .
no , a bomb . now , as discreetly as possible , i want you to move the passengers into the lounge .
what should i say ?
captain oveur ?
mr . kurtz , i presume .
that is how dry cleaning works . now i would like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians .
good to be aboard , gentlemen .
whenever your are ready , captain .
you folks need any help ?
thanks , but we have a terrific woman in on thursdays .
say , is not that dr . barrington , the world renowned agronomist ?
yes .
it is a privilege to meet you , sir , i am familiar with all your work .
let s go , daddy . we have to check in . he was never appreciated at the institute .
ah , yes , the institute , i am familiar with it .
i have to see bud kruger .
do you have an appointment , sir ?
no , dammit . it is a matter of life or death .
you will have to be more specific than that , sir .
all right , it is a matter of death .
you cannot go in there !
do not try to stop me !
are you on the mercury mission ?
you are seeing bugs where they do not exist , striker .
look at this wiring . it is shorting out under high temperatures .
you are tired , striker , overworked . that wiring meets all the safety specifications .
striker .
kurtz , you are drunk . who s in command of this ship ?
that damn computer has taken over . i am getting out .
then elaine was right .
do not talk to me about elaine . outta my way !
excuse me , are you alright ? i noticed you talking to yourself . i am a nurse . can i be of some help ?
uh . . . oh , thank you . it is nothing .
you do not have to thank me , i am a nurse . this is my father , dr . barrington .
not dr . barrington , the world renowned agronomist ?
yes . he is dying u a n d u wants to be buried on mercury .
i am familiar with your work , doctor . you will have to excuse me , i have to go .
you have been hurt .
i am getting over it . if a relationship is not working , you cannot force it .
do you want to talk about it .
i opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me .
no . i mean your relationship .
we were in love but i am not sure i know what love is anymore .
love s the same as it always was . it is people who change .
people change in relation to each other . love changes on its own .
not if the people change together in relation to that love .
sure . but that is only when the love itself goes unchanged .
then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there s change in the two people who share that love .
no . it is hard to l a u g h when your father s dying .
i happened to be passing , and i thought you might like some corfee .
ah , will not you sit down ?
thank you . cream ?
no , thank you . i take it black . like my men .
were you vacationing in los angeles ?
well , it really was not a vacation . you see , i am a teacher in the new york city school system , and i was attending a seminar on visual aids to education . are you from l . a . ?
after my wife died , i felt like a fifth wheel . you know , so many years being with one person a very wonderful person makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair . . . when ethel passed away , i was lost . i could not function socially and i could not function in business .
well , after a thing like that you would not be expected to .
but i think it is time we stopped talking about me . a woman like you why have not you ever married ?
well , i am afraid that is a question that is all too easy to answer .
i know the answer career . a smart woman like you became so involved in your work , you did not have time for marriage .
i wish i could fool myself into believing that that is the reason . the truth of the matter is , nobody ever asked me .
you know , here we are having coffee together , and discussing education and business and economy . . . and we do not even know each other s names . . . full names i mean .
mine s eleanor . eleanor schiff .
i am sure we will both make it . . . but just in case one of us . . . well , is there a message you would like me to give someone ?
no . i am all alone .
just in case i do not have a chance to say goodbye , i want you to know that i have not spent so many pleasant hours for many years .
hello , i am paul carey from the airline . i am here to pick up captain kramer .
shep , sit . . . sit ! so , i understand you have got a real emergency down there .
well , to tell the truth , they really did not fill me in on many of the details . just told me to pick up captain kramer .
yeah , something like that , but as i say , they did not have time to tell me very much .
. . . but after . . . awhile . . . you begin to . . . . . . get used to it .
both pilots !
can you fly this airplane and land it ?
surely you cannot be serious .
i u am u serious , and do not call me shirley ! what flying experience have you had ?
elaine , i have not time to put this gently , so i will be very direct . everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation . mister striker is the only hope we have got .
. . . safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment .
will the hospital equipment be at the airport ?
yes , everything they have got . how are the passengers doing ?
i will not deceive you , mister striker . we are running out of time .
surely there must be something you can do .
george zipp said that ?
and the last thing he said to me , doc , he said , sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys , tell them to go out there with all they have got and win just one for the zipper . i do not know where i will be then , doc , he said , but i will not smell too good . that is for sure .
captain , how soon can we land ?
cannot you take a guess ?
well . . . not for another two hours .
you cannot take a guess for another two hours ?
what is it , doctor ? that is happening ?
sir . excuse me , sir . i am sorry to have to wake you . are you a doctor ?
that is right .
we have some passengers who are very sick . could you come and take a look at them ?
you would better tell the captain . we have got to land as soon as we can . this woman has to be gotten to a hospital .
a hospital ? what is it ?
it is a big building with patients . but that is not important right now . tell the captain i must speak to him .
what was it we had for dinner tonight ?
well , we had a choice . steak or fish .
what did he have ?
doctor rumack , mister hammen ate fish . and randy says there are five more cases , and they ate fish , too .
let s see now . the co pilot had fish . what did the navigator eat ?
just how serious is it , doctor ?
elaine , you are a member of this crew . can you face some unpleasant facts ?
no .
all right . unless i can get all these people to a hospital quickly , i cannot even be sure of saving their lives . now , is there anyone else on board who can land this plane ?
no . no one that i know of .
elaine !
ted !
i came home early and found your note . i guess you meant for me to read it later . elaine , i have got to talk to you .
i just do not want to go over it any more .
i know things have not been right for a long time , but it will be different . if you will just be patient , i can work things out .
i have been patient and i have tried to help , but you would not even let me do that .
do not you feel anything for me at all any more ?
look , you will be back in town tomorrow night . we will have dinner talk it over .
i will not be back . i have requested the atlanta run .
elaine , not yet . i promise you i really can change .
you know i have not been able to get near an airplane since the war . and even if i could , they would not hire me because of my war record .
your u war u u record u ? you are the only one keeping that alive . for everyone else it is ancient history .
it is the truth . that is hurt you the most is your record since the war . different cities , different jobs , and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility .
but if you will just give me . . .
ted , what are you doing here ?
elaine , i have got to talk to you .
that is the matter ?
my orders came through . my squadron ships out tomorrow . i will be leading a very important mission .
oh , ted , please be careful . i worry about you so much .
i love you , elaine .
elaine , just hear me out . i know things have not been right for a long time . but it will be different . . . like it was in the beginning . remember ?
mostly i remember . . . the nights when we were together . i remember how you used to hold me . . . and how i used to sit on your face and wriggle . . . and then afterwards how we would watch until the sun came up . when it did , it was almost like . . . like each new day was created . . . only for us .
that is the way i have always wanted it to be , elaine .
you got a telegram from headquarters today .
headquarters ! ? what is it ?
is it ? because of my mistake six men did not return from that raid .
i wish i could say the same for george zipp .
that is his problem ?
i think they are getting the hang of it ! when we re enlist i will teach them baseball !
ted , i do not want to stay here . it is time for us to go back home to the plans we made before the war .
ted ! what are you doing ? you cannot fly this plane !
rain .
and a little ice .
sluggish . like a wet sponge .
it is a damn good thing he does not know how much i hate his guts .
rats ! i have lost number three .
what happened , ted ? what went wrong ?
but ted , you are the only . . .
ted . . .
yes ?
i wanted you to know now i am very proud .
tell them the gear is down and we are ready to land .
see them , elaine ?
we have a visitor .
we would better get back now .
hey , we have been waiting for you . a little bit late tonight .
airsick ?
i think so , but i have never seen it so acute .
oh , bill , i am going to miss you so much .
you promise you will write .
good bye , darling .
oh , bill , i will keep it . i will keep it with me all the time .
so long , darling . good bye . take care of yourself .
bill ! bill ! good bye , bill .
good bye , darling .
good bye , darling . i love you . i love you , darling .
and get that finger out of your ear . you do not know where that finger s been ! gunderson ?
yes , captain ?
did you decide on a runway yet ?
eight miles . turn right to heading zero eight niner .
he is all over the place ! nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet ! what an asshole !
he is right on the heading .
jack , is not that fred bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck ? maybe he is on our flight to chicago .
what did you think of great expectations ?
oh , i cannot stand it .
how ya doing , honey ?
oh jack , i am so warm . i am burning up .
wait a minute . i know you . you are kareem abdul jabbar . you play basketball for the los angeles lakers !
you u are u kareem . i have seen you play . my dad s got season tickets !
i am an airline pilot . ah , clarence , according to my calculations , with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the rockies .
i think you are the greatest . but my dad says you do not work hard enough on defense .
denver control , this is flight two zero niner intersecting victor airway seven niner niner .
. . . and that lots of times you do not even run down court .
we are turning left to a heading of zero niner niner .
. . . and that you do not really try , except during the playoffs .
hi !
i am randy .
i am lisa . oh , you have a guitar !
i thought maybe you would like to hear a song .
oh , i would love to .
would either of you like another cup of coffee ?
yes ?
oh , stewardess . my husband is very sick . can you do something , please ?
well , the doctor will be with you in just a moment . one thing do you know what he had for dinner ?
yes , of course . we both had fish . why ?
sorry , clarence . latest weather report shows everything socked in from salt lake to lincoln .
roger .
roger .
we have clearance , clarence .
do you want me to check the weather , clarence ?
no , he is not bothering anyone . let him stay up here .
excuse me , sister ?
yes ?
there s a little girl on board who s ill and . . .
oh yes , i saw . poor child .
could i borrow your guitar ? i thought i might be able to cheer her up .
fourteen b . it is halfway down on your right .
do you feel all right , sir ?
excuse me , sir . would you like some coffee before we serve dinner ?
excuse me , sir . there s been a little problem in the cockpit and i was wondering . . .
the cockpit ? what is it ?
well , i flew in the war , but that was a long time ago . i would not know anything about it .
mr . striker , the passengers are ready .
oooh . hardball . that sounds interesting . are you going to strike me ? you could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me . . . i have got my own ropes .
does that cost extra or you throw them in ?
look , i do not know where mr . strader might be . he comes and he goes .
the girl out front mentioned strader s assistant , somebody named watson . maybe he knows .
i know . . . why do not you hang around for a while , let me entertain you ? it is matt , right ? now tell me the truth , have you ever . . . made it . . . with one of us ?
not unless i got real drunk and nobody told me about it later .
there s lots of things i have not done , but his ai not high on the list . do not take it personally .
i think you are just a little scared now , about what you might find once the lights go out . a little scared . . . and a lot curious . maybe more than you want to admit . but does not that turn you on , that curiosity and fear , swirling together ? think of it as broadening your horizons .
i like my horizons narrow .
you okay ?
you are cassandra ?
that is right .
we are with the police department . this is sergeant sykes , and i am
he is not here . why ask me ?
the young woman at the front said you might know where he is .
in there .
so what have you got on tuggle s killers ?
jesus , sykes it is been less than ten hours . me and alterez are on it , okay ?
you do not have squat .
look at your dildo partner . he is too scared to even come down to the sand . you are not gonna get wet standing here , moron !
well , if it is not detective jetson . forget you hip waders , big guy ?
lay off , asshole .
william harcourt ?
yes . . .
i am sergeant sykes , and this is detective jetson , los angeles police department .
yes , i heard about poor warren . tragic .
you were partners with him on some slag uh , newcomer real estate thing .
move a finger , harcourt , and you are history . . .
that cop , the human , he was the one who killed anderson and the driver .
this is becoming a serious breach of security .
he did not recognize me .
when we picked him up , he was talking to those two cops the two who came to question you about hubley .
kill them both .
here ?
. . . and we work my hours . i will do the driving , you do the paperwork . you gotta learn it so you might as well do it all .
sergeant . . . i would like to thank you for what you are doing .
that is that ? look , jetson . get this straight in your head . we are not pals , we are not married , and we ai not gonna take long moonlight walks together . . . we are just partners . and do not call me sergeant . call me sykes . . . or matt if you have to .
man , somebody really hung one on you ! i have heard some good ones for you guys . . . humphrey bogart , harley davidson . i guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while , coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you . you were not at the back of the line , were you , george ?
my true name is ss tangya t ssorentsa .
anyway , that is it matter to you if we think it is funny , right ? whatta you care ?
let s talk hubley .
his body was discovered three days ago , in an alley off of central avenue , near downtown .
with two bri sabot slugs in the chest .
through the chest . rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts .
terrific . a real pillar of the community . was hubley missing anything when they found him ? was he ripped off ?
there was no wallet . . . but he was still wearing a watch and two rings .
the guys at the mini mart last night made a half assed stab at the money in the till but i do not think that is what they were there for . i think we got us a couple a executions on our hands , george . . .
look , you want to fit in here , right ? you want to learn how to get along ?
yes .
what is wrong ?
well . . . yes , quite possibly .
possibly . good . well , would you be willing to accept the theory , george , that . . . possibly . . . by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other ? does that sound unreasonable to you ?
yes . . . no , it is not unreasonable . although i
that is this ? that is going on ?
nothing .
nothing ?
what is this ?
get the picture ?
and that fits ?
well . . . yeah , it is rubber . it stretches .
newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks .
how the hell do you know that ?
a large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us . my spouse s brother is one .
so the slag they are cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like hubley worked at a refinery . i would say that possible connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible . okay , next step i gotta go talk to the wife of the slag store owner blown away last night .
i believe i should interview the widow alone .
mrs . porter is not taking her husband s death well .
did you learn anything ?
a week ago two men came to see her husband . after they left , he was very frightened . she identified one of the men from a photo i showed her . it was hubley .
aw right . what about the other guy ?
she did not know him . but she said her son might .
did you talk to him ?
rudyard kipling ? no shit ? listen , we just need a minute of your time . . .
why did you do it ?
why would i do what ?
agree to work with me ? you do not like me . . . you do not like any of us . you have nothing but contempt for us . and yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner . . .
who said that ?
your name would not happen to be porter , would it ?
uh , matthew . . .
back off , george .
but i .
screw you .
tell me .
your mother mates out of season .
matthew , you do not have to .
you know that guy ?
from quarantine , when my people first arrived here . he and i were housed together .
how could a straight arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him ?
if i may make a suggestion . . . we have different weak spots than you do . next time , a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm , here , will produce the effect i think you were looking for .
i do not think i could ever learn to read that shit . how long did it take you to learn english ?
which one is that ? raw what ?
this is mole . it is good .
i will bet . would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two ?
so what was that other word for human . . . slow ka ?
ss loka . it means literally small but intelligent creature . it loses much in the translation .
and what was that one about my mother ? that was a good one .
ss trokya ss lato na .
who is he ?
we were chasing you because you ran , you dumb son of a bitch .
i believe he is probably lying .
so , she keeps you on a pretty short leash , does she ?
yeah . . . i know the routine .
you are married ?
was . divorced .
we mate for life . divorce . . . is a strange concept to us .
your home is quite disordered . i thought perhaps you had been burglarized when i walked in .
human children can be very beautiful . getting married ? congratulations . you will be taking sunday off , then . . .
. . . and so , and so the doctor says , if this is the thermometer , then where would i leave the pen ? you are not . . . you do not think that is funny ? george , work with me , i always get a laugh with that one . look , if the doctor s got the thermometer in his hand , then where is his pen gotta be ?
in the other mangs rectum .
your health . . .
there is so much our two peoples do not understand about each other .
no shit , holmes . you are only from another goddamn planet , for chrissakes .
i hope you can understand how special your world is . . . how unique a people you humans are . so it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves .
i am going home .
where would you get this ? ! !
she is going to divorce me .
george , she is not gonna divorce you . you mate for life , remember ?
well , let s roll , george .
to the . . . to the beach ?
stop the car .
why ?
please , i must get out here .
come on , you will not have to get near the water .
it is all right , george . it is cool . just wait here , all right ? i will be back in a coupla minutes .
what was that about ?
. . . so we have got three guys dead . all newcomers , all killed the same way execution style .
warren hubley was in middle management at a refinery . . . joshua strader operated a successful bar and nightclub . . .
that is this nothing shit ? it was not nothing yesterday when you asked bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits , and it is not nothing now . do not lie to me , george , you are bad at it .
no secrets , goddammit ! you do not hold back from me . whatever is going on , you are gonna tell me now !
no . i cannot involve you . this is not your concern .
the hell it is not , when somebody wires up enough c explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist ! that slag was on something , and not sour milk , either ? am i right ? tell me ! what is it ?
. . . it is called ss jabroka . to us it is a potent narcotic .
how potent ?
like your cocaine , i suppose . the high lasts several hours . we would receive small amounts of it . . . as a reward for our labor .
we ? you have taken it ?
we all did .
where did he get it ? was there any of it on the ship ?
no . . . i am sure not . that is why i am so concerned . . . someone must now be producing it here . but none of my people know how to make it . the process was carefully guarded .
jesus , this is major . why did not you tell me sooner ? why would you hold out on me ?
george . . . look me in the eye . . . george , you do not ever lie to me again .
they had months in quarantine to develop the plan . porter , with his chemistry background , must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug . hubley manufactured it at the refinery . strader , through the nightclub , established a distribution network . and harcourt
okay , george we gotta play this real smart .
if the drug is here , we must destroy it .
uh , george . . .
george , uh . . . you are gonna break his little chest bones . . .
george , c mon lighten up . it is a beauty of a case . do not sweat it we got him by the short hairs . he ai not gonna make any more of the shit .
the fifty kilos , matthew . i have to find it . i cannot let it get out on the street .

shit !
with harcourt and kipling dead , i assume you will be requesting reassignment now .
that is this about , george ? i know that look .
no ! we must do this alone .
what is this ? !
. . . it is harcourt .
harcourt is dead .
no he is not . not if he overdosed on the drug . massive amounts trigger a . . . a change . your body functions seize up , you appear to be dead , but it is really a state of incubation . when you emerge you are . . .
i never thought i would say this , but for once in my life i think i am willing to wait for back up .
we cannot let him get away .
why the hell are you so dead set against back up ?
because . . . because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming .
but there s no more drug .
how do i look ?
you said you wanted the biggest thing i could find . . . well , this is it .
what is it ?
casull . magnum . you are talking twice the impact energy of . magnum hot loads .
only holds five .
yeah , the shells are too big for six in an cylinder . hell , matt , you do not need but one .
mr . hubley was an all right guy and a damn good manager . the men liked him . i am really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes .
you think this is the guy who did it ?
we think he could a been involved , yeah . you know him ?
to be honest , it is hard to say . i hate to admit it but they all still kinda look alike to me .
who else can i ask around here ?
wait . you know who it looks like ? yeah . anderson . uh . . . james anderson . he is not in today . he took the afternoon off .
that where anderson worked ?
do not piss him off , o neal . when he gets like this , i cannot control him . i have seen this before . he got like this once i saw him jerk a guy s spine out and show it to him . nothing i could do . i hadda go throw up .
here s hubley . left quarantine on november thirtieth , relocated first to riverside , then moved to los angeles early in february the following year . field of expertise chemical manufacturing . looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery .
try joshua strader , will ya , darling ?
released december one . he and his wife moved first to modesto , then coalinga , california wherever that is settled in l . a . in april . field of expertise organic chemical engineering . he and his wife have one child , a son .
yeah we met him . wonderful boy . . . close personal friend of george s here .
can you dig up their quarantine records in this thing ?
jesus , are the questions too tough for you already ? let s try again is your name porter ?
ss kya ta .
one of the two men was hubley , right ? what about the other one ? did you know him ?
yeah . . . i seen him around . high roller dude named strader . joshua strader . runs a club on the west side . encounters .
yeah , i heard of it .
you know i have been over all this with fedorchuk and alterez this morning . . .
yeah , right . do not push your luck . anyway , according to the sheet , the guy you nailed outside by the car
the human ?
no i . d . on him and well , you know , no fingerprints so it could be tough . your buddies this morning went through the mug book but could not make a facial match .
you took this gut out , too , did not you ?
yeah .
lucky for you , you got him in both of his . . . well , what we loosely refer to as . . . hearts .
lucky nothing . i had to empty my damn gun into him .
oh , here s an extra headshot if you need one . we are just about to start cutting in . you are welcome to stick around if you want . it is really fascinating stuff .
you guys finished the postmortem on strader yet ?
what kind of test ?
looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day .
yeah , sykes ?
you are to have nothing to do with the investigation into bill tuggle s death . you know that . leave that for fedorchuk .
departmental policy .
granger and pitts are already on it .
granger and pitts have one hell of a caseload . . . and i would have thought with jetson here being the first newcomer plainclothes , and hubley s body being found over in the newcomer community . . .
hope their plumbing s the same .
how can i go ?
put on your wash and wear suit and your clip on tie , have your landlady tie your shoes for you , and show up at the church . simple . me and carol are going .
what ?
hey , look we have known kristin since . . . since she was conceived in that cabin up in big bear . remember ? you and edie banged the wall so hard , me and carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week . . .
goddammit , tug i want to see kristin get married , okay ? but
but you are bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing .
does that look at all suspicious to you ?
you got your vest ?
of course . right in the trunk of the car .
watch the driver . i am going for a better angle on the door .
get outta there !
i cannot ! do you mind !
this floor s freezing .
christ . i never saw such a buncha old women . you want me to fetch your slippers , hudson ?
whoooah ! no shit ? i am impressed .
hey , top . that is the op ?
movement !
position ?
cannot lock up . . .
talk to me , hudson .
. . . that is better . pan it around a bit .
okay , let s do it .
set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast . immediate dust off on my clear , then stay on station .
first squad up , on line . hicks , get yours in a cordon . watch the rear .
flame units only . i want rifles slung .
uh , . . . apone , i want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the apc , over .
i have isolated a neuro muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis . it seems to be metabolizing . he should wake up soon .
which would mean lots of those parasites , right ? one for each person . . . over a hundred at least .
yes . that follows .
but these things come from eggs . . . so where are all the eggs coming from .
that is the question of the hour . we could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization . an ant of termite colony , for example , is ruled by a single female , a queen , which is the source of new eggs .
you are saying one of those things lays all the eggs ?
well , the queen is always physically larger then the others . a termite queengs abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it cannot move at all . it is fed and tended by drone workers , defended by the warriors . she is the center of their lives , quite literally the mother of their society .
could it be intelligent ?
that is it . see it ? emergency venting .
how long until it blows ?
and it is too late to shut it down ?
i will go .
what ?
i am really the only one qualified to remote pilot the ship anyway . believe me , i would prefer not to . i may be synthetic but i am not stupid .
it is going to be closer . you better get going .
how much time ?
plenty ! twenty six minutes !
ripley . . .
she is alive . they brought her here and you know it .
you did okay , bishop .
fifty seven . . . oh , christ . . .
have they located my daughter yet ?
is she . . . ?
amy .
you read my deposition . . . it is complete and accurate .
look , i believe you , but there are going to be some heavyweights in there . you got feds , you got interstellar commerce commission , you got colonial administration , insurance company guys . . .
i get the picture .
you had them eating out of your hand , kiddo .
they had their minds made up before i even went in there . they think i am a head case .
no . there s no way !
hear me out . . .
what about you ? that is your interest in this ?
yeah , yeah . i saw the commercial .
i heard you were working in the cargo docks .
that is right .
running loaders , forklifts , that sort of thing ?
it is all i could get . anyway , it keeps my mind off of . . . everything . days off are worse .
what if i said i could get you reinstated as a flight officer ? and that the company has agreed to pick up your contract ?
if i go .
if you go . it is a second chance , kiddo . and it will be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it . you gotta get back on the horse . . .
yes , and i have read it . you wake up every night , sheets soaking , the same nightmare over and over . . .
yello ? oh , ripley . hi . . .
burke , just tell me one thing . that you are going out there to kill them . not study . not bring back . just burn them out . . . clean . . . forever .
you never said anything about an android being here ! why not ?
i hope you are right . i really do .
that the atmosphere processor ?
they are right under the primary heat exchangers .
yeah ? maybe the organisms like the heat , that is why they built . . .
that is not what i mean . gorman , if your men have to use their weapons in there , they will rupture the cooling system .
no good . how do we know it will effect their biochemistry ? i say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit . it is the only way to be sure .
now hold on a second . i am not authorizing that action .
well , i mean . . . i know this is an emotional moment , but let s not make snap judgments . let s move cautiously . first , this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it
they can bill me . i got a tab running . that is second ?
this is clearly an important species we are dealing with here . we cannot just arbitrarily exterminate them
you son of a bitch .
do not make me pull rank , ripley .
what rank ? i believe corporal hicks has authority here .
corporal hicks ! ?
those specimens are worth millions to the bio weapons division . now , if you are smart we can both come out of this heroes . set up for life .
you just try getting a dangerous organism past icc quarantine . section of the commerce code .
you have been doing your homework . look , they cannot impound it if they do not know about it .
but they will know about it , burke . from me . just like they will know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty seven colonists here
now , wait a second
you sent them out there and you did not even warn them , burke . why did not you warn them ?
i expected more of you , ripley . i thought you would be smarter than this .
look , we do not know that is going on out there . it may just be a down transmitter . but if it is not , i want you there . . . as an advisor . that is all .
you would not be going in with the troops . i can guarantee your safety .
these colonial marines are some tough hombres , and they are packing state of the art firepower . nothing they cannot handle . . . right , lieutenant ?
still nothing from the colony ?
looks like you company can write off its share of this colony .
that is he scanning for ?
we are talking thermonuclear explosion .
how may drops is this for you , lieutenant ?
hold at forty . slow circle of the complex .
one of us ?
where are your parents ? you have to try . . .
what is it ?
i do not know .
so .
so . . . then the fusion containment shuts down .
get them out of there ! do it now !
i told them to fall back . . .
how do you feel ?
all right , i guess . one hell of a hangover . look , ripley . . . i . . .
at ease . i am sorry we did not have time to brief before we left gateway but . . .
sir ?
yes , hicks ?
hudson , sir . he is hicks .
that is the question ?
is this going to be a stand up fight , sir , on another bug hunt ?
are there any questions ? hudson ?
all right , the area s secured . let s go in and see what their computer can tell us . first team head for operations . hudson , see if you can get their cpu on line . hicks , meet me at the south lock by the up link tower . . .
. . . we are coming in .
sir , the cpu is on line .
hah ! stop your grinning and drop your linen ! found em .
alive ?
we are not making that out too well . what is it ?
save it .
let s get the fuck out of here !
well that is great ! that is just fucking great , man . now what the fuck are we supposed to do , man ? we are in some real pretty shit now !
outstanding . then all we need s a deck of cards . all right , let s move like we got a purpose .
we got problems .
maybe we got em demoralized .
the corner ! ready ?
seventeen meters .
well you are not reading it right !
let s go ! let s go !
removed surgically before embryo implantation . subject marachuk , john l . died during procedure . they killed him getting it off .
how long after we are declared overdue can we expect a rescue ?
all right . there s a fire door at this end . the first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door .
we gotta figure on them getting into the complex .
they are in the approach corridor .
now many ?
newt time then can walk right up and knock .
they will get us .
maybe . maybe not .
hicks , i am not going to wind up like those others . you will take care of it will not you , it if comes to that ?
that is this ?
well , that is the grenade launcher . . . you probably do not want to mess with that .
look , you started this . now show me everything . i can handle myself .
wait a minute . we would know about it .
you know , burke , i do not know which species is worse . you do not see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage .
it is game time .
they learned . they cut the power and avoided the guns . they must have found another way in , something we missed .
locked .
no ! no ! she is alive ! we have to
hicks , do not let him leave .
ellen .
hey , vasquez . . . you ever been mistaken for a man ?
somebody said alien . . . she thought they said illegal alien and signed up .
fuck you .
all right , we cannot blow the fuck out of them . . . why not roll some canisters of cn down there . nerve gas the whole nest ?
yeah , bullshit . watch us .
oh , man . and i was getting short , too ! four more weeks and out . now i am gonna buy it on this fucking rock . it ai not half fair , man !
it is inside the complex .
you are just reading me .
sounds like you , hicks .
looks like it stung him .
you cannot help them . right now they are being cocooned just like the others .
man , we are not going to make it seventeen hours ! those things are going to come in here , just like they did before , man . . . they are going to come in here and get us , man , long before . . .
this service tunnel is how they are moving back and forth .
thanks .
we need the other drop ship . the on one the sulaco . we have to bring it down on remote , somehow .
how ? the transmitter was on the apc . it is wasted .
i do not care how ! think of a way . think of something .
think of what ? we are fucked .
well then somebody s just going to have to go out there . take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually .
they cut the power .
this signal s weird . . . must be some interference or something . there s movement all over the place . . .
range twenty meters .
fifteen meters .
twelve meters . man , this is a big fucking signal . ten meters .
nine meters . eight .
cannot be . that is inside the room !
you remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau , out past the ilium range , a couple days ago ?
yeah . what ?
there s a guy on the horn , mom and pop survey team . says he is homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored .
christ . some honch in a cushy office on earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere , we look . they do not say why , and i do not ask . i do not ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer s always wouldo not ask .
so what do i tell this guy ?
and how are we today ?
terrible .
just terrible ? that is better than yesterday at least .
how long have i been on gateway station ?
bad dreams again ? do you want something to help you sleep ?
what did you say ?
casey . she is my only friend .
i do not want you for a friend .
why not ?
they would be here if they could , honey . i know they would .
they are dead .
newt . look at me . . . newt . i will not leave you . i promise .
you promise ?
cross my heart .
i was the best at the game . i knew the whole maze .
the maze ? you mean the air ducts ?
yeah , you know . in the walls , under the floor . i was the ace . i could hide better than anybody .
i guess we are not leaving , right ?
i am sorry , newt .
now you just lie here and have a nap . you are exhausted .
ripley . . . she does not have bad dreams because she is just a piece of plastic .
oh . sorry , newt .
yes , there are , are not there .
well , some kids cannot handle it like you can .
i do not know , newt . that is the truth .
is not that how babies come ? i mean people babies . . . they grow inside you ?
no , it is different , honey .
did you ever have a baby ?
yes . a little girl .
where is she ?
gone .
do not go ! please .
newt . newt , wake up .
wah . . . ? where are . . . ?
mommy . . . i mean , ripley . . . i am scared .
burke ! open the door !
come on . crawl faster .
do you know how to get to the landing field from here ?
this way . come on , we are almost there !
i knew you would come .
mommy . . . mommy ?
are we going to sleep now ?
that is right .
can we dream ?
look , i told you . . .
the analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe . . .
look , i can see where this is going . but i am telling you those things exist . back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs . thousands . do you understand ? i suggest you find it , using the flight recorder s data . find it and deal with it before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise . . .
thank you , officer ripley . that will be . . .
why will not you check out lv ?
because i do not have to . the people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and hostile organism or alien ship . and by the way , they call it acheron now .
how many colonists ?
sixty , maybe seventy families .
a sweetheart or a pretty little wife is papageno s wish . a willing , billing , lovey dovey would be my most tasty little dish . be my most tasty little dish ! be my most tasty little dish !
then that would be eating and drinking i would live like a prince without thinking . the wisdom of old would be mine a womangs much better than wine ! then that would be eating and drinking ! the wisdom of old would be mine a womangs much better than wine . she is much better than wine ! she is much better than wine !
a sweetheart or a pretty little wife is papageno s wish . a willing , billing , lovey dovey would be my most tasty little dish .
i need to net one birdie only and i will stop feeling so lonely . but if she will not fly to my aid , then into a ghost i must fade . i need to net one birdie only but if she will not fly to my aid , then into a ghost i must fade . to a ghost i must fade ! to a ghost i must fade !
a sweetheart or a pretty little wife is papageno s wish . a willing , billing , lovey dovey would be my most tasty little dish .
follow me , please . the archbishop would like a word .
well , i think that went off remarkably well , do not you ?
indeed .
these viennese certainly know good music when they hear it .
his grace is very angry with you .
maestro .
good morning .
well ? how do you like it ? it is turkish . my hairdresser tells me everything s going to be turkish this year !
really ? what else did he tell you today ? give me some gossip .
well , i heard you met herr mozart .
oh ? news travels fast in vienna .
and he is been commissioned to write an opera . is it true ?
yes .
is there a part for me ?
no .
how do you know ?
well even if there is , i do not think you want to get involved with this one .
why not ?
well , do you know where it is set , my dear ?
where ?
in a harem .
that is that ?
a brothel .
oh !
a turkish brothel .
turkish ? oh , if it is turkish , that is different . i want to be in it .
oh . well perhaps you could introduce us anyway .
what does he look like ?
you might be disappointed .
why ?
looks and talent do not always go together , katherina .
did you know ? had you heard ?
what ?
the marriage !
well , what does it matter to you ?
how was i ? tell me honestly .
you were sublime .
what did you think of the music ?
extremely clever .
katherina ! i will tell you what i am going to do . i am going to write another aria for you . something even more amazing for the second act . i have to get some water . her mother is lying on the stage .
do not bother !
what ?
do not bother .
oh excuse me !
is her mother still lying on the floor ?
no , she is fine .
is she a good fuck ?
what ? ?
no , no , no , no . you cannot take him away now . this is his night . will not you introduce us , wolfgang ?
no ! i will not have him back .
but he needs to be here in salzburg , your grace . he needs me and he needs you . your protection , your understanding .
hardly .
oh sir , yes ! he is about to make the worst mistake of his life . some little viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage . i know my son . he is too simple to see the trap and there is no one there who really cares for him .
i am not surprised . money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship . he has sold himself to vienna . let vienna look out for him .
sir
your son is an unprincipled , spoiled , conceited brat .
yes , sir , that is the truth . but do not blame him . the fault is mine . i was too indulgent with him . but not again . never again , i promise ! i implore you let me bring him back here . i will make him give his word to serve you faithfully .
and how will you make him keep it ?
oh , sir , he is never disobeyed me in anything . please , your grace , give him one more chance .
you have leave to try .
why what , sir ?
why do i have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants ?
humiliated ?
if his grace is not satisfied with me , he can dismiss me .
i wish you to return immediately to salzburg . your father is waiting for you there patiently . i will speak to you further when i come .
no , your grace ! i mean with all humility , no . i would rather you dismissed me . it is obvious i do not satisfy .
don giovannnnnnnni !
who the devil are you ? what do you want ?
i have come to dinnnnnner !
dinner ? how dare you ? i am a nobleman . i only dine with people of my own height .
in the pot , i have got a good dinner . not a sausage or stew , but a singer . not a sausage or stew but a singer . is the treat that i will eat for my meat !
what is it ?
i want to go !
where ?
i want to go back to vienna .
now ?
yes !
why ?
i feel wrong . i feel wrong being here .
stop it !
no ! no ! no !
yes ! back ! back ! listen do not you know where you are ?
where ?
we are in the residence of the fartsbishop of salzburg .
your grace , i have got something to tell you . i want to complain about this man .
go ahead , tell him . tell them all . they will not understand you anyway .
why not ?
because here everything goes backwards . people walk backwards , dance backwards , sing backwards , and talk backwards .
that is stupid .
why ? people fart backwards .
do you think that is funny ?
oh , ha , ha , ha .
sra i am sick ! sra i am sick !
yes , you are . you are very sick .
no , no . say it backwards , shit wit . sra i am sick say it backwards !
sra i am sick . sick kiss i am my kiss my ! sra i am sick kiss my arse !
em iram ! em iram !
no , i am not playing this game .
no , this is serious . say it backwards .
no !
just say it you will see . it is very serious . em iram ! em iram !
iram marry em marry me ! no , no ! you are a fiend . i am not going to marry a fiend . a dirty fiend at that .
ui vol i tub !
tish i am tee . that is that ?
what ?
tish i am tee .
eat
yes .
excuse me , wolfi . mama is not feeling very well . can we leave now ?
i think you are mad ! you are really mad !
oh , leave me alone .
one royal pupil and the whole of vienna will come flocking . we would be set up for life !
they will come anyway . they love me here .
no , they will not . i know how things work in this city .
oh yes ? you always know everything .
well , i am not borrowing any more money from my mother , and that is that !
you borrowed money from your mother ?
yes !
well , do not do that again !
how are we going to live , wolfi ? do you want me to go into the streets and beg ?
do not be stupid .
all they want to see is your work . that is wrong with that ?
shut up ! just shut up ! i do not need them .
stop it now . stop it . i have brought some friends to meet you . they are next door waiting . do we have anything to eat ? they are all starving .
tell them to go away . i do not want to see anybody .
that is the matter with you ?
tell them to go !
sssh . what is it ? tell me .
no !
yes !
my stanzi look at her ! is not she beautiful ? come on now , confess , papa . could you want a prettier girl for a daughter ?
stop it , wolfi . i look dreadful . welcome to our house , herr mozart .
may i offer you some tea , herr mozart ?
tea ? who wants tea ? let s go out ! this calls for a feast . you do not want tea , papa . let s go dancing . papa loves parties , do not you ?
wolfi !
what ? how can you be so boring ? tea !
there s a young girl to see you .
what does she want ?
i do not know .
well , ask her !
she will not talk to me . she says she has to speak to you .
look , old man , you stay out of this . we spend a fortune on you , more than we can possibly afford , and all you do is criticize , morning to night . and then you think you can
stanzi !
we will have a little party . come in . come in . you know herr schikaneder ? this is ! a very nice girl .
wolfi .
yes , my love ?
these gentlemen are from salzburg .
salzburg . we were just talking about salzburg . if you have come from my friend the fartsbishop , you have arrived at just the right moment . because i have got good news for him . i am done with vienna . it is over , finished , done with ! done with ! done with !
wolfi ! your father is dead .
what ?
half the receipts ! stanzi !
you are not going to do this ?
why not ? half the house !
when ? we need money now . either he pays now , or you do not do it .
oh , stanzi .
i do not trust this man . and i did not like what he did with your opera . it was common .
well , you liked it , did not you ? monkey flunki punki .
half the house ! you will never see a penny . i want it here , in my hand .
stanzi manzi , i will put it in your hand !
who was that ?
no one .
that is that ? oh ! who gave you this ? how much is it ? wolfi , who gave you this ?
i am not telling you .
why not ?
no . do not answer it !
this is my wife , stanzi . i have been sick , but i am all right now . are not i ?
oh yes , sir . he is all right . and he is working on it very hard .
give me one reason i can understand .
i cannot write it !
why not ?
go back to bed .
excellency !
frau mozart ?
that is right , your excellency . i have come on behalf of my hus band . i am i am bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment .
how charming . but why did he not come himself ?
he is terribly busy , sir .
i will look at them , of course , the moment i can . it will be an honour . please give him my warmest .
would it be too much trouble , sir , to ask you to look at them now ? while i wait .
i am afraid i am not at leisure this very moment . just leave them with me . i assure you they will be quite safe .
i i really cannot do that , your excellency . you see , he does not know i am here .
really ?
my husband is a proud man , sir . he would be furious if he knew i would come .
then he did not send you ?
no , sir . this is my own idea .
i see .
thank you very much , your excellency .
are you sure you cannot leave that music , and come back again ? i have other things you might like .
that is very tempting , but it is impossible , i am afraid . wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing . you see , they are all originals .
originals ?
these are originals ?
it is miraculous .
tomorrow night i dine with the emperor . one word from me and the post is his .
come back tonight .
tonight ?
alone .
what for ?
some service deserves service in return . no ?
what do you mean ?
it is a post all vienna seeks . if you want it for your husband , come tonight .
but ! i am a married woman !
i do apologize for this afternoon . i behaved like a silly girl . where shall we go ?
what ?
what are you doing here ?
your husband is ill , ma am . he took sick . i brought him home .
why you ?
i was at hand .
well , thank you very much . you can go now .
he needs me , ma am .
no , he does not . and i do not want you here . just go , please .
he asked me to stay .
this is not his handwriting .
no . i was assisting him . he asked me .
i regret we have no servants to show you out , herr salieri . respect my wish and go .
how much will you pay him ?
am i interrupting something ?
not at all .
where is our friend ?
he is not in . but he is working on it . he said to tell you .
look , you little clown , do you know how many people i have hired for you ? do you know how many people are waiting ?
leave him alone !
i am paying these people . do you realize that ?
he is doing his best .
i am paying people just to wait for you . it is ridiculous !
you know that is ridiculous ? your libretto , that is that is ridiculous . only an idiot would ask wolfi to work on that stuff !
oh yes ? and that is so intelligent about writing a requiem ?
money ! money !
you are mad ! she is mad , wolfi .
i see that you are expecting .
oh , yes .
when , may i ask ?
what is ridiculous ? wolfi has many admirers in vienna . they love him here . people send us gifts all the time .
but you cannot take her without reference . it is unheard of !
and so you do ! the only time you come out is to eat .
and what do you expect ? who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day ?
oh , now i am a bad housekeeper !
so you are ! the place is a pigsty all the time .
be careful !
he is adorable !
behold !
hey !
behold !
let us pass , please ! let us pass at once ! we are with the emperor .
i am sorry , madame . it is not permitted .
do you know who i am ? this is my daughter . i am frau weber . we are favoured guests !
i am sorry , madame , but i have my orders .
i am sorry , madame , but no ! i cannot let anyone pass .
upstairs .
gertrude !
i have heard about you for ages ! i thought you must be an old man .
gertrude !
it is such an honour for us to have you here , herr mozart . and for gertrude .
people who know say the girl s got talent . you must judge for yourself . if you think she stinks , say so .
i said play !
what a strange young man .
really ?
perhaps a little refreshment first ? a little coffee , or a little chocolate ?
i would like a little wine , if you have it .
just one year .
who was your teacher ?
i was . but she quite outgrew the little i could show her .
i think it is an interesting notion to keep mozart in vienna , majesty . it should really infuriate the archbishop beyond measure if that is your majesty s intention .
what a charming idea . may i see ?
it is just a trifle , of course .
may i try it ?
delightful , court composer . would you permit me to play it as he comes in ?
you do me too much honour , sire .
a flat , majesty .
and here is our illustrious court composer , herr salieri .
my pleasure .
well , i am glad to hear that .
excuse me , sire , but what do you think these could be ? being a foreigner , i would love to learn .
good morning , court composer . this is my niece , the princess elizabeth .
oh , your majesty , it would be such a tremendous honour !
an interesting idea , majesty . but
yes ?
you already commissioned an opera from mozart .
and the result satisfies .
yes , of course . my concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism .
ah ha . favouritism . but i so want mozart .
i am sure there is a way , majesty . some kind of a little contest . i could perhaps put together a small committee , and i could see to it naturally that it will select according to your majesty s wishes .
you please me , court composer . a very clever idea .
sire .
i do not think you understand me , court composer .
majesty , i did . believe me , it was a most agonizing . decision . but finally , i simply could not recommend herr mozart .
why not ?
well , sire , i made some inquiries in a routine way . i was curious to know why he had so few pupils . it is rather alarming .
majesty , i do not like to talk against a fellow musician .
of course not .
i have to tell you , mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies .
really ?
as a matter of fact , one of my own pupils a very young singer told me she was er well !
yes ?
do you like this , salieri ?
it is not a question of liking , your majesty . your own law decrees it , i am afraid .
your majesty !
oh , thank you .
the director of our opera . count orsini rosenberg .
and now he has returned the compliment . herr salieri composed that march of welcome for you .
majesty !
why so ?
well , what is it about ? tell us the story .
yes , where ?
in a pasha s harem , majesty . a seraglio .
keep it , sire , if you want to . it is already here in my head .
what ? on one hearing only ?
it is new , it is , is not it , sire ?
yes , indeed .
and german ?
oh , yes . absolutely . german . unquestionably !
so then you like it ? you really like it , your majesty ?
of course i do . it is very good . of course now and then just now and then it gets a touch elaborate .
what do you mean , sire ?
i do not understand . there are just as many notes , majesty , as are required . neither more nor less .
my dear , young man , do not take it too hard . your work is ingenious . it is quality work . and there are simply too many notes , that is all . cut a few and it will be perfect .
majesty , this is madame weber . she is my landlady .
really ? how delightful . may i ask when you marry ?
excuse me , but how old are you ?
twenty six .
bravo , mozart . most charming . yes , indeed . clever man .
majesty , may i ask you to do me the greatest favour ?
what is it ?
may i introduce my father ? he is on a short visit here and returning very soon to salzburg . he would so much like to kiss your hand . it would make his whole stay so memorable for him .
mozart , are you aware i have declared the french play of figaro unsuitable for our theatre ?
yes , sire .
yet we hear you are making an opera from it . is this true ?
who told you this , majesty ?
it is not your place to ask questions . is it true ?
well , yes , i admit it is .
would you tell me why ?
mozart , i am a tolerant man . i do not censor things lightly . when i do , i have good reason . figaro is a bad play . it stirs up hatred between the classes . in france it has caused nothing but bitterness . my own dear sister antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people . i do not wish to see the same fears starting here .
sire , i swear to your majesty , there s nothing like that in the story . i have taken out everything that could give offense . i hate politics .
but , majesty , this is just a frolic . it is a piece about love .
ah , love again .
but it is new , it is entirely new . it is so new , people will go mad for it . for example , i have a scene in the second act it starts as a duet , just a man and wife quarreling . suddenly the wife s scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly a very funny situation . duet turns into trio . then the husband s equally screaming valet comes in . trio turns into quartet . then a stupid old gardener quartet becomes quintet , and so on . on and on , sextet , septet , octet ! how long do you think i can sustain that ?
i have no idea .
guess ! guess , majesty . imagine the longest time such a thing could last , then double it .
well , six or seven minutes ! maybe eight !
forgive me , majesty . i am a vulgar man . but i assure you , my music is not .
you are passionate , mozart ! but you do not persuade .
ah ha . well then , we should make some effort to acquire him . we could use a good german composer in vienna , surely ?
i agree , majesty , but i am afraid it is not possible . the young man is still in the pay of the archbishop .
ah ha . what do you say , chamberlain ?
yes , sir .
well , what do you have for me today ?
your majesty , herr mozart
yes , what about him ?
he is here .
i write to you with urgent news . i am coming to vienna . take no further steps toward marriage until we meet . you are too gullible to see your own danger . as you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours , do as i bid , and await my coming .
why are you here ?
am i not welcome ?
feed ? well , of course she feeds me . she stuffs me like a goose all day long . she is the best cook in the world . i mean , since mama . just wait , you will see .
is she not here ?
do you always live like this ?
she is very tired , poor creature . you know me i am a real pig . it is not so easy cleaning up after me .
do not you have a maid ?
oh we could , if we wanted to , but stanzi will not hear of it . she wants to do everything herself .
how is your financial situation ?
it could not be better .
that is not what i hear .
what do you mean ? it is wonderful . really , it is it is marvelous ! people love me here .
they say you are in debt .
who ? who says that ? now that is a malicious lie !
how many pupils do you have ?
pupils ?
yes .
yes .
how many ?
i do not know . it is not important . i mean , i do not want pupils . they get in the way . i have got to have time for composition .
composition does not pay . you know that .
that is that ?
oh , let s not talk about it .
why not ?
it is a secret .
you do not have secrets from me .
is not that marvelous ? we are delighted .
why did not you mention it in your letters ?
thank you . that will be fine . do not spend any money on me .
no , really !
yes , papa , name it . name it . i will do anything you say !
i am tired of this game . please play without me .
papa , is this your idea ?
are you playing a trick on me ?
never mind . you will not have to do anything for me ever again . i am leaving !
papa !
do not worry , i am not staying here to be a burden .
no one calls you that .
father
ah ! here she comes . fraulein lorl , good morning .
good morning , sir .
ah ha ! siena macaroons my favourites . give my best thanks to the baker .
thank you . are you well today , fraulein lorl ?
yes , thank you , sir .
madame cavalieri is here for her lesson , sir .
oh , thank you , sir .
do any pupils come to the house ?
not that i have seen .
then how does he pay for all this ? does he work at all ?
oh , yes , sir , all day long . he never leaves the house until evening . he just sits there , writing and writing . he does not even eat .
really ? what is it he is writing ?
oh , i would not know that , sir .
i think i have found out about the money , sir .
where does he work ?
now calm yourself . calm . that is the matter with you ?
i am leaving . i am not working there anymore . i am scared !
why ? what has happened ?
you do not know what it is like . herr mozart frightens me . he drinks all day , then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse .
what medicine ?
i do not know . he has pains .
where ?
here , in his stomach . they bend him right over .
is he working ?
i am frightened , sir . really ! when he speaks , he does not make any sense . you know he said he saw he said he saw his father . and his father s dead .
is he working ?
i suppose so . he sits there all he time , doing some silly opera .
opera ? opera !
please do not ask me to go back again . i am frightened ! i am very , very frightened .
yes ?
are you herr mozart ?
that is right .
my name is lorl , sir . i am a maidservant . i was asked to come here and offer my services to you .
what ?
are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and does not want us to know who he is ?
sssh !
stanzi manzi banzi wanzi !
what did he say ? what did he say ?
well ?
sublime ! utterly sublime !
wonderful ! he liked the monkey , did not you ?
yes , well , it is all good fun .
is not he marvelous ? he cost me a bundle , that horse , but he is worth it . i tell you , if you would played don giovanni here it would have been a great success . i am not joking . these people are not fools . you could do something marvelous for them .
i would like to try them someday . i am not sure i would be much good at it .
course you would . you belong here , my boy , not the snobby court . you could do anything you felt like here the more fantastic the better ! that is what people want , you know fantasy . you do a big production , fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you will be absolutely free to do anything you want . of course , you would have to put a fire in it , because i have got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood i can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life . oh , and a few trick animals . you would have to use those .
animals ?
i am serious . you write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs , i will guarantee you will have a triumph de luxe . mind you , it will have to be in german .
german !
of course ! what else do you think they speak here ?
no , no , i love that . i would want it to be in german . i have not done anything in german since seraglio .
leave that alone !
wolfi !
put it down !
what is this ?
put it down , i said ! it is nothing for you .
oh ! i am sorry ! i am sorry ! what have you got for me ? is it finished ?
what ?
what ? the vaudeville , what would you think ?
yes .
can i see it ?
no .
why not ?
look , i asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes .
well , we can .
quiet ! quiet ! quiet ! down there , damn you . welcome to you . pay no attention , they are impossible . stop it , you willful things ! come this way . just ignore them . they are perfectly harmless , just willful . i treat them just like my own children .
and which one of them do you want me to teach ?
you will not be teaching this one either . she is my wife .
madame .
i am afraid i am .
good morning , fraulein schlumberg .
never mind , strudel . it is part of music , getting used to an audience . are not i right , herr mozart ?
it is a miracle , herr mozart !
herr mozart . what a surprise . what can i do for you ?
is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music ?
well , your pupil is married and living in mannheim , young man .
really ? perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction ?
what is this , mozart ? that is the matter with you ?
well . since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services , could you favour me with a little money instead ?
what for ?
if a man cannot earn , he must borrow .
well , this is hardly the way to go about it .
i am sorry . no .
please . i will give it back , i promise . please , sir .
i know your work well , signore . do you know i actually composed some variations on a melody of yours ?
really ?
mio caro adone .
ah !
love , sire !
yes ! yes ! er , on the whole , yes , majesty .
dear mozart , my sincere congratulations .
did you like it , then ?
how could i not ?
herr mozart , what brings you here ?
your excellency , you requested some specimens of my work . here they are . i do not have to tell you how much i need your help . i truly appreciate your looking at these . i have pressures on me financial pressures . as you know , i am a married man now .
so you are . how is your pretty wife ?
she is well . she is well , actually , i am about to become a father ! she only told me last night . you are the first to know .
i am flattered . and congratulations to you , of course .
why did not you come to me yesterday , mozart ? this is a most painful situation . yesterday i could have helped you . today , i cannot .
why ? here is the music . it is here . i am submitting it humbly . is not that what you wanted ?
i have just come from the palace . the post has been filled .
filled ? that is impossible ! they have not even seen my work . i need this post . please , cannot you help me ? please !
my dear mozart , there is no one in the world i would rather help , but now it is too late .
whom did they choose ?
herr sommer .
sommer ? herr sommer ? but the mangs a fool ! he is a total mediocrity .
no , no , no he has yet to achieve mediocrity .
but i cannot lose this post , i simply cannot ! excellency , please . let s go to the palace , and you can explain to the emperor that herr sommer is an awful choice . he could actually do musical harm to the princess !
look , i must have pupils . without pupils i cannot manage .
you do not mean to tell me you are living in poverty ?
no , but i am broke . i am always broke . i do not know why .
it has been said , my friend , that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means .
how can anyone say that ? we have no cook , no maid . we have no footman . nothing at all !
how is that possible ? you give concerts , do not you ? i hear they are quite successful .
they are stupendously successful . you cannot get a seat . the only problem is none will hire me . they all want to hear me play , but they will not let me teach their daughters . as if i was some kind of fiend . i am not a fiend !
of course not .
do you have a daughter ?
i am afraid not .
well , could you lend me some money till you have one ? then i will teach her for free . that is a promise . oh , i am sorry . i am being silly . papa s right i should put a padlock on my mouth . seriously , is there any chance you could manage a loan ? only for six months , eight at most . after that i will be the richest man in vienna . i will pay you back double . anything . name your terms . i am not joking . i am working on something that is going to explode like a bomb all over europe !
ah , how exciting ! tell me more .
i would better not . it is a bit of a secret .
come , come , mozart i am interested . truly .
actually , it is a big secret . oh , this is delicious ! what is it ?
cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum . crema al mascarpone .
ah . italian ?
forgive me . we all have patriotic feelings of some kind .
two thousand , two hundred florins is all i need a hundred ? fifty ?
what exactly are you working on ?
i cannot say . really
wolfgang , what is it ? sta calmo , per favore . that is the matter ?
it is unbelievable ! the director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music . pages of it .
really ? why ?
i do not know . they say i have got to re write the opera , but it is perfect as it is . i cannot rewrite that is perfect . cannot you talk to him ?
why bother with orsini rosenberg ? he is obviously no friend of yours .
oh , i could kill him ! i mean really kill him . i actually threw the entire opera on the fire , he made me so angry !
you burned the score ?
oh no ! my wife took it out in time .
how fortunate .
it is not fair that a man like that has power over our work .
but there are those who have power over him . i think i will take this up with the emperor .
oh , excellency , would you ?
with all my heart , mozart .
nine performances ! nine ! that is all it is had and withdrawn .
i know it is outrageous . still , if the public does not like one s work one has to accept the fact gracefully .
but what is it they do not like ?
well , i can speak for the emperor . you made too many demands on the royal ear . the poor man cannot concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four .
what did you think of it yourself ? did you like it at all ?
i think it is marvelous . truly .
it is the best opera yet written . i know it ! why did not they come ?
i think you overestimate our dear viennese , my friend . do you know you did not even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap ?
i know , i know . perhaps you should give me some lessons in that .
i would not presume . all the same , if it would not be imposing , i would like you to see my new piece . it would be a tremendous honour for me .
oh no , the honour would be all mine .
grazie , mio caro , wolfgang !
mozart . it was good of you to come .
how could i not ?
did my work please you ?
how could it not , excellency ?
yes ?
i never knew that music like that was possible .
you flatter me .
i have come to commission work from you .
what work ?
a mass for the dead .
what dead ? who is dead ?
a man who deserved a requiem mass and never got one .
who are you ?
i am only a messenger . do you accept ? you will be paid well .
how long will you give me ?
i do not have it yet . it is not finished . i am sorry , but i need more time .
are you neglecting my request ?
what happened ? is it over ?
i am taking you home . you are not well .
where is your wife ?
not here ! she is not well , either . she went to the spa .
you mean she is not coming back ?
you are so good to me . truly . thank you .
no , please .
i would never miss anything that you had written . you must know that .
this is only a vaudeville .
oh no . it is a sublime piece . the grandest operone . i tell you , you are the greatest composer known to me .
do you mean that ?
i do .
i have bad fancies . i do not sleep well anymore . then i drink too much , and think stupid things .
are you ill ?
the doctor thinks i am . but
what ?
shall i answer it ?
no ! no , it is him !
who ?
the man . he is here .
wait ! ask him if he would give me some money now . tell him if he would , that would help me finish it .
finish what ?
another ? but that is too soon ! tomorrow night ? it is impossible ! did he say a hundred ?
yes . can i could i help you , in any way ?
would you ? actually , you could .
my dear friend , it would be my greatest pleasure .
but you would have to swear not to tell a soul . i am not allowed .
of course .
you know , it is all here in my head . it is just ready to be set down . but when i am dizzy like this my eyes will not focus . i cannot write .
then , let us try together . i would regard it as such an honour . tell me , what is this work ?
where did i stop ?
the end of the recordare statuens in parte dextra .
so now the confutatis . confutatis maledictis . when the wicked are confounded . flammis acribus addictis . how would you translate that ?
consigned to flames of woe .
do you believe in it ?
what ?
a fire which never dies . burning one forever ?
oh , yes .
strange !
confutatis maledictis .
we ended in f major ?
yes .
the fire .
what time ?
start with the voices . basses first . second beat of the first measure a . con fu ta tis . second measure , second beat . ma le dic tis . g sharp , of course .
yes .
third measure , second beat starting on e . flam mis a cri bus ad dic tis . and fourth measure , fourth beat d . ma le dic tis , flam mis a cri bus ad dic tis . do you have that ?
i think so .
good . now the tenors . fourth beat of the first measure c . con fu ta tis . second measure , fourth beat on d . ma le dic tis . all right ?
yes .
now the orchestra . second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses . identical notes and rhythm . the first bassoon and tenor trombone
it could not be simpler .
first bassoon and tenor trombone what ?
with the tenors .
also identical ?
and that is all ?
do you have me ?
i think so .
that is wonderful !
c major . sopranos and altos in thirds . altos on c . sopranos above . vo ca , vo ca me , vo ca me cum be ne dic tis .
sopranos up to f on the second voca ?
yes , and on wouldictis .
and that is it . do you have it ?
you go fast !
do you have it ?
yes .
do you want to rest a bit ?
oh no . i am not tired at all .
we will stop for just a moment . then we will do the lacrimosa .
i can keep going , i assure you . shall we try ?
would you stay with me while i sleep a little ?
i am not leaving you .
i am so ashamed .
what for ?
oh ? have i seen it ?
i i do not think you have , herr director . not yet . i mean , it is quite n of course , i will show it to you immediately .
you mean in turkey ?
exactly .
then why especially does it have to be in german ?
what you think , mozart , is scarcely the point . it is what his majesty thinks that counts .
that will do , herr mozart !
mozart ! herr mozart , may i have a word with you please . right away .
did you not know that his majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas ?
yes , but this is not a ballet . this is a dance at figaro s wedding .
exactly . a dance .
but surely the emperor did not mean to prohibit dancing when it is part of the story .
what are you doing , herr director ?
can we see the scene with the music back , please ?
what is this , herr chamberlain ?
what is what ?
why do i have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee ? just to teach a sixteen year old girl .
because his majesty wishes it .
is the emperor angry with me ?
on the contrary .
then why does not he simply appoint me to the post ?
mozart , you are not the only composer in vienna .
no , but i am the best .
a little modesty would suit you better .
who is on this committee ?
kapellmeister bonno , count orsini rosenberg and court composer salieri .
naturally , the italians ! of course ! always the italians !
mozart
they hate my music . it terrifies them . the only sound italians understand is banality . tonic and dominant , tonic and dominant , from here to resurrection ! ba ba ! ba ba ! ba ba ! ba ba ! anything else is morbid .
mozart
show them one interesting modulation and they faint . ohime ! morbidezza ! morbidezza ! italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music !
look , young man , the issue is simple . if you want this post , you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues .
herr mozart
i do not think it was really decided , director .
my dear fellow , the language is not finally the point . do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre ?
well done , mozart . really quite fine .
mozart
sire , only opera can do this . in a play , if more than one person speaks at the same time , it is just noise . no one can understand a word . but with music , with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once , and it is not noise it is a perfect harmony . is not that marvelous ?
mozart , music is not the issue here . no one doubts your talent . it is your judgment of literature that is in question . even with the politics taken out , this thing would still remain a vulgar farce . why waste your spirit on such rubbish ? surely you can choose more elevated themes ?
elevated ? what does that mean ? elevated ! the only thing a man should elevate is oh , excuse me . i am sorry . i am stupid . but i am fed up to the teeth with elevated things ! old dead legends ! how can we go on forever writing about gods and legends ?
what do you want ?
i am father vogler . i am a chaplain here . i thought you might like to talk to someone .
about what ?
you tried to take your life . you do remember that , do not you ?
so ?
in the sight of god that is a sin .
what do you want ?
do you understand that you have sinned ? gravely .
leave me alone .
i cannot leave alone a soul in pain .
do you know who i am ? you never heard of me , did you ?
that makes no difference . all men are equal in god s eyes .
are they ?
offer me your confession . i can offer you god s forgiveness .
i do not seek forgiveness .
my son , there is something dreadful on your soul . unburden it to me . i am here only for you . please talk to me .
how well are you trained in music ?
i know a little . i studied it in my youth .
where ?
here in vienna .
i cannot say i do . what is it ?
well ?
i regret it is not too familiar .
oh , i know that ! that is charming ! i did not know you wrote that .
i did not . that was mozart . wolfgang amadeus mozart . you know who that is ?
of course . the man you accuse yourself of killing .
ah you have heard that ?
all vienna has heard that .
and do they believe it ?
is it true ?
do you believe it ?
do you hear me ?
it was incomprehensible . what was god up to ? here i was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve god s gift and there was mozart indulging his in all directions even though engaged to be married ! and no rebuke at all ! was it possible i was being tested ? was god expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense , no matter how painful ? that was very possible . all the same , why him ? why use mozart to teach me lessons in humility ? my heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man . for the first time in my life i began to know really violent thoughts . i could not stop them .
did you try ?
yes , father . yes ! so much for my vow of chastity . what did it matter ? good , patient , hard working , chaste what did it matter ? had goodness made me a good composer ? i realized it absolutely then that moment goodness is nothing in the furnace of art . and i was nothing to god .
you cannot say that !
no ? was mozart a good man ?
god s ways are not yours . and you are not here to question him . offer him the salt of penitence . he will give you back the bread of eternal life . he is all merciful . that is all you need to know .
all i ever wanted was to sing to him . that is his doing , is not it ? he gave me that longing then made me mute . why ? tell me that . if he did not want me to serve him with music , why implant the desire , like a lust in my body , then deny me the talent ? go on , tell me ! speak for him !
my son , no one can speak for god .
oh ? i thought you did so every day . so speak now . answer me !
i do not claim to unravel the mysteries . i treasure them . as you should .
what ?
his funeral imagine it ! the cathedral , all vienna sitting there . his coffin , mozart s little coffin in the middle . and suddenly in that silence , music . a divine music bursts out over them all , a great mass of death requiem mass for wolfgang mozart , composed by his devoted friend antonio salieri . what sublimity ! what depth ! what passion in the music ! salieri has been touched by god at last . and god , forced to listen . powerless powerless to stop it . i at the end , for once , laughing at him . do you understand ? do you ?
yes .
why ? why ? why ? why add to your misery by confessing to murder ? you did not kill him .
i did .
no , you did not !
i poisoned his life .
but not his body .
what difference does that make ?
my son , why should you want all vienna to believe you a murderer ? is that your penance ? is it ?
no , father . from now on no one will be able to speak of mozart without thinking of me . whenever they say mozart with love , they will have to say salieri with loathing . and that is my immortality at last ! our names will be tied together for eternity his in fame and mine in infamy . at least it is better than the total oblivion he would planned for me , your merciful god !
oh my son , my poor son !
i have just learned something that might be of interest to you , herr director .
yes ?
mozart is writing a new opera . an italian opera .
you mean that play ?
exactly .
he is setting that play to music ?
yes .
are you absolutely sure ?
i have seen the manuscript .
where ?
well , mozart is already rehearsing .
incredible .
what anger ?
about the ballet .
ballet ? what ballet ?
excuse me did not his majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera ?
yes , absolutely . is there a ballet in figaro ?
bravo , your majesty !
well , actually , sire , if you remember , we did finally incline to italian .
i know we banned this play , but frankly i cannot remember why . can you refresh my memory , herr director ?
for the same reason , herr chamberlain , that it was banned in france .
oh yes , yes . and that was ?
well , the play makes a hero out of a valet . he outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher . do you see the implications ? this would be , in a grander situation , as if a chamberlain were to expose an emperor .
here i am , my angel .
what ? who the devil are you ?
i have taken pity on you , my angel . i heard your wish .
now you have got to promise me faithfully you will remain true to me forever . then you will see how tenderly your little birdie will love you .
i cannot wait .
well , promise then .
what do you mean now ?
well , i do not know ! i mean you are a delicious , delightful , delectable little bird , but do not you think you might be just a little tough ?
this is embarrassing , you know . you introduced mozart to some of my friends and he is begging from practically all of them . it has to stop .
i agree , baron .
cannot you think of anyone who might commission some work from him ? i have done my best . i got him to arrange some bach for my sunday concerts . he got a fee what i could afford . cannot you think of anyone who might do something for him ?
no , baron , no . i am afraid mozart is a lost cause . he has managed to alienate practically the whole of vienna . he is constantly drunk . he never pays his debts . i cannot think of one person to whom i dare recommend him .
how sad . it is tragic , is not it ? such a talent .
excuse me , sir , there is a lady who insists on talking to you .
who is she ?
she did not say . but she says it is urgent .
that lady is back , sir .
what does he want ?
he did not say , sir . i told him i did not know when you would be back , but he insisted on waiting .
herr salieri .
yes , i am looking after him .
can we come in ?
well , he is sleeping now . better not .
but he is all right ?
oh , yes . he is just exhausted . he became dizzy , that is all . we should let him rest .
well , tell him we were here , will not you ?
of course .
and say everything went wonderfully . a triumph de luxe say that ! tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times .
bene .
i will call tomorrow .
oh , by the way , give him this . this is his share . that should cheer him up , eh ?
has the patient in twenty one gotten his tray yet ?
the american ? yes , duck .
how did he look ?
what do you mean , how did he look ?
you know , did he seem depressed ? do you think he will eat the food ?
i am an orderly , not a bleeding psychiatrist ! i push things about , but i have little say what happens to them .
dr . hirsch , mr . kessler cried out a minute ago .
can i be of service , miss price ?
dr . hirsch ?
go about your duties .
oh , miss price ?
yes , doctor ?
what exactly did he call out ?
he said jack .
that would be jack goodman , the boy who was killed .
what happened to them ?
the police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them . he must have been a very powerful man . although i really do not see that it is any of your concern , miss price .
did he say a wolf ?
it is all right , susan . yes , doctor , i have .
oh dear girl , your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me . i do not give a damn who you sleep with . i am concerned about david .
yes , sir .
it is a full moon . where is he ?
he is not ?
alex , has david persisted in his werewolf fantasies ?
well , yes , but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend .
has his friend appeared to him again ?
yes .
what did he say ?
david says jack comes to warn him .
warn him ?
dr . hirsch , that is wrong ? is this more serious than i know ?
i tried to investigate the attack . there are no records . the case was closed and now they have misplaced the file . david s lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before i did . the goodman boy is already in the ground so he is no good to us . so i went to the pub in east proctor where i was convinced of two things .
yes .
they were lying . there were no witnesses , no escaped lunatic . the whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there .
and what else ?
you have absolutely no idea where david might be ?
surely you are not suggesting . . .
david has suffered a severe trauma . i myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in east proctor . if all the villagers believe that jack goodman was killed by a werewolf , why should not david ? and then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf , would not he himself become a werewolf the next full moon ?
dr . hirsch ?
oh , i do not mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon . but in such a deranged state he could harm himself , or perhaps others .
what shall we do ?
he is here .
is he all right ? why did not you call me ? where was he ?
he does not remember . he woke up at the zoo .
the zoo ? is he rational ?
yes , he is . he is very excited and confused , but he is not crazy , if that is what you mean .
have you read the papers today ? have you listened to the radio or television ?
no , why ?
is david acting strangely ?
could you get here without any trouble ?
yes , i should think so .
right . now listen carefully . i want you to bring david here . i want him in my care . i will notify the police that we have found him . it is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital . do you understand ?
yes , doctor .
you are certain he is lucid ? you will not need any help ?
he is fine . we will come right over .
shall i send a car ?
no , a cab will be faster .
what shall we do ?
nurse hobbs said there s a disturbance in leicester square involving some sort of mad dog .
david ?
it was not a lunatic .
i beg your pardon ?
it was a wolf .
what ?
mr . kessler ?
yes ?
you have not eaten your lunch .
i am not very hungry , thank you .
i am afraid you have to eat something .
please , really . i am not hungry .
you put me in an awkward position , mr . kessler .
how is that ?
well , you are to take these after you have eaten . now what kind of nurse would i be if i failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills ?
leave the pills . i will take them later .
aw come on , miss price !
call me alex .
aw come on , alex !
call me david .
shall i be forced to feed you , david ?
this is absurd . i am not hungry . i do not want any food .
let s try a little harder , shall we ?
you are a very beautiful girl .
i thought you were asleep .
i was . what are you reading ?
a connecticut yankee in king arthur s court by mark twain .
do you like it ?
what do you dream about ?
i dream of death mostly .
i am sorry . i should not have asked you .
how old are you ?
that is not really a very proper question .
how old are you ?
twenty eight .
i am twenty seven .
i know .
now what do you want to talk about ?
was jack goodman your good friend ?
my best friend . my very best friend .
shall i read to you ?
what ? oh , yes , please .
a connecticut yankee in king arthur s court by samuel l . clemens . this is after the preface but before chapter one a word of explanation . you all right ?
yes , go on .
hello . you all right ?
i am sorry i woke you up .
do not be silly . can i get you something ?
no , thank you . just keep me company for a while .
that is easy enough .
i keep having these really terrible dreams . they are getting worse and i cannot seem to stop them .
david , your dreams will stop . you will leave england and your bad memories and then this will all fade away .
will you come with me ?
what ?
i am serious . you do not know me and i know nothing about you . we have a perfect relationship .
now , david , i said i would keep you company , but i meant right here and now .
will you think about it ?
how did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient ?
not just a patient me .
you are being awfully forward , are not you ?
forgive me , i am trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it .
all i am to you is a sex fantasy then ?
now i am embarrassed .
i am a werewolf .
are you better now ?
i will let you know the next full moon .
my friend jack was just here .
your dead friend jack ?
yeah . he says that i will become a monster in two days . what do you think ?
what do i think ? you mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends ?
i was dreaming again ?
i would think so .
the kitchen .
closet .
charming .
bathroom .
lovely .
the bedroom .
there is only one bed .
it is nice to see you .
alex ?
yes ?
will you be here in about fifteen minutes ?
of course .
david , you do not honestly believe that in reality your friend jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you ? do you really ?
i was awake and he was in my room .
but , david .
tomorrow is the full moon .
let me go now , you will make me late .
do me an enormous favor ?
anything .
tell me that it is silly of me to be apprehensive .
it is silly of you to be apprehensive .
werewolves simply do not exist .
david , do you want me to stay here tonight ?
listen , if you get too anxious , call me at the hospital , okay ?
okay .
i have left those pills for you .
i am off . there s food in the fridge .
david ! where on earth have you been ! ? !
alex , i have lost my mind . i woke up at the zoo ! but you know what ? i feel terrific !
the zoo ?
waking up at the zoo , that is not so insane . having no clothes on ? that is insane . what did i do last night , alex ?
do not you remember ?
the next corner we can get a cab .
i should be committed .
dr . hirsch will know what to do .
but . . .
david , what are you doing ?
six people mutilated ? it had to be me , alex .
i am going to the cops . there s a full moon tonight . jack was right . i . . .
jack is dead !
david , please be rational . let s go to dr . hirsch .
he is playing a stupid joke , sir .
what ?
we had an argument . he is being silly .
sir , he is very upset . his friend was killed and . . .
hopeless . it is hopeless .
leave me alone , dammit ! you people are crazy ! i have got to get away from here ! i have got to do something !
david , do not lose control .
hello , benjamin .
no .
no what ?
no .
well , all right then , be that way . here , swallow this .
feeling better ?
no .
the doctor will be round later . would you like a picture book to look at ? we have some lovely funny beanos .
no .
how are we feeling tonight ?
no .
no what ?
no !
benjamin , have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck ?
no .
he all right ?
yes , i should think . he called out just now .
he is an american , you know . dr . hirsch is going to fetch round one of those embassy fellows to see him .
chart says he is from new york .
i think he is a jew .
why on earth do you say that ?
i looked .
miss price .
yes , mrs . hobbs .
take these round now , will you please ? the american boy in twenty one is only to have these after he is eaten . will you be sure of that ?
has he been refusing food ?
nothing quite as dramatic as that , miss price . he just does not eat enough of what is put before him . he suffers from nightmares . i would think he just needs a hand to hold .
officer , i killed those people last night .
all right , you two , move along .
hey , you asshole ! i want you to arrest me !
there s no call for that kind of language .
queen elizabeth is a man ! prince charles is a faggot ! winston churchill was full of shit !
now see here young man .
who is this girl ?
you are going to have to stop this disturbance or i shall arrest you .
why are you doing this to me , jack ?
this is not mr . goodmangs idea . he is your good friend , whereas i am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities .
mr . bringsly , i am sorry . i have absolutely no idea what to say to you .
that is easy for you to say you are already dead .
no , david . harry and i and everyone you murder are not dead . the undead .
here , gladys , tom . did you hear the one about the crashing plane ?
you be quiet , woman , and let me speak .
all right , laugh then . i sha not tell it .
oh , come on , tell us .
oh , all right . there was this airplane over the atlantic on its way to new york . it was full of men from the united nations .
no one brought them here ! no one wanted them here !
mr . kessler ? wake up , please .
now go back to sleep so you will be fresh for dr . hirsch in the morning .
what time is it ?
it is nearly eight . i am off duty shortly , then i am off to the films with alex .
alex ?
miss price , the other nurse that attended you .
what are you going to see ?
an american film about the mafia called see you next wednesday , and i want to see it badly , so you give me no problems and go to sleep .
do you have bad dreams , too ?
some , everyone does .
yes , but does everyone kill bambi ?
hello , david . i am dr . hirsch and this is a countryman of yours , mr . collins .
where am i ?
you are in a hospital in london .
london ? where is jack ? i had a strange dream .
i should think so after your recent traumatic experiences .
the guy i was with . is he all right ? how did i get to london ?
miss price ! miss price , please !
how long have i been here ?
you have been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago .
two weeks ?
you have suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises , lost a bit of blood , but nothing too serious black and blue for a while . you will have some dueling scars to boast of . that lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow . they say a mad man has the strength of ten .
lunatic ?
there were witnesses ?
so they said .
how could there have been witnesses ? it was so dark . we were running and i fell and jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere . . . i do not understand what they are talking about .
in time i am sure it will all come back to you .
you have never had bad dreams before ?
did you get a good look at the man who attacked you ?
i have told you , it was not a man . it was an animal . a big wolf or something . a rabid dog .
yes .
look , dr . hirsch , i know i have been traumatized , but jack was torn apart . i saw him . a man cannot do that to someone with his bare hands .
you would be surprised what horrors a man is capable of .
did you see jack ?
no . in fact , your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here .
did you talk to the police in east proctor ? did the cops go to the slaughtered lamb ?
i really do not know .
then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me ? you yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that .
david , please . the police are satisfied . i am certain that if a monster were out roaming northern england we would have seen it on the telly .
you really think i am crazy , do not you ?
dr . hirsch ? i would rather not be by myself .
are you cold ?
yes .
jack .
david .
you are not having a good time are you ?
well , i like it here .
i am sorry . northern england first , italy later .
do you think she will meet me in rome ?
i think debbie klein is a mediocre person with a good body .
debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time .
she is a jerk .
you are talking about the woman i love .
i am talking about a girl you want to fuck , so give me a break .
well , anyway , do you think she will be there ?
i do not know .
rendezvous in rome starring jack goodman and debbie klein . the love affair that shocked europe ! see torrid lovemaking at its most explicit ! see jack and debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the vatican ! never has the screen dared . . .
if you do not stop , i am going to kill you .
i have to make love to her . it is very simple . she has no choice really .
it just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull .
it is impossible for a body like that to be dull .
we have known debbie what , since the eighth grade ? how many years of foreplay is that ?
the slaughtered lamb ?
of course , the slaughtered lamb . why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol ?
that is a wolf s head .
of course , the slaughtered lamb . why else would they have a severed wolf s head on a spear as their symbol ?
that is not a spear . it is a pike .
a severed wolf s head on a pike as their symbol .
david , before we go in there i want you to know that no matter what happens to us it is your fault .
i assume full responsibility .
okay .
hello .
nice looking group .
listen , at least it is warm in here .
what about it ?
it is a five pointed star .
ask them what the candles are for .
you ask them .
listen , that is a pentangle , a five pointed star . it is used in witchcraft . lon chaney , jr . and universal studios maintain it is the mark of the wolf man .
i see . you want me to ask these people if they are burning candles to ward off monsters .
right .
go on , ask them .
jack , we would better go .
come on , jack , shall we go ? ! !
what the hell was that all about ?
i do not know . let s see if there s an inn or something up the road .
beware the moon ?
that was weird . i guess leaving was the best idea .
i do not know . now that we are out here and it is three degrees , i am not so sure i would not rather face a blood thirsty mob .
what do you think was wrong ?
i have no idea .
maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural .
say , david . . .
did you hear that ?
i heard that .
could be a lot of things .
yeah ?
a coyote .
there are not any coyotes in england .
the hound of the baskervilles .
pecos bill .
heathcliffe .
heathcliffe did not howl .
no , but he was on the moors .
i vote we go back to the slaughtered lamb .
shit ! david , what is that ?
i do not know . come on .
come on , where ?
it is moving .
that is the plan ?
plan ?
it is in front of us .
oh shit . what is that ?
nice doggie . good boy .
walk away , jack .
see anything ?
it sounds far away .
jack ?
yeah .
where are we going ?
i will tell you when we get there .
you really scared me , you shithead .
nice to see you .
get the fuck out of here , jack .
thanks a lot .
this is too much . i cannot handle this .
david ! you are hurting my feelings .
hurting your feelings ? has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me ? listen to me , i am talking to a hamburger !
i am sorry to be upsetting you , david , but i had to come .
are not you supposed to be buried in new york someplace ?
yeah . your parents came to my funeral . i was surprised at how many people came .
why should you be surprised ? you were a very well liked person .
debbie klein cried a lot .
i cannot stand it .
so you know what she does ? she is so grief stricken she runs to find solace in rudy levine s bed .
rudy levine the shmuck ?
i am going completely crazy .
david !
what ? !
david , now i know this may be hard for you , but i have to warn you .
warn me ? will you get out of here , you meat loaf ?
i am a grisly sight , it is true but i love you and that is why i am here . you have got to know .
if you love me so much , jack , you will realize how disconcerting it is to share one s breakfast with the living dead !
we were attacked by a werewolf .
i am not listening !
on the moors , we were attacked by a lycanthrope , a werewolf .
shut up , you zombie !
i was murdered , an unnatural death , and now i walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf s curse is lifted .
that is wrong with you ? shut up !
the wolf s bloodline must be severed . the last remaining werewolf must be destroyed .
it is you , david .
what ? !
you survived and now you shall continue the curse .
what are you talking about ? i will not accept this ! get out ! god damit !
remember what that guy at the slaughtered lamb said ? beware the moon .
stop it , jack .
beware the moon . the full moon , david . you have got two days .
jack , please go away . please go away .
you will stalk the streets of london a creature of the night .
you are talking like boris karloff ! it is movie dialogue !
david , please believe me . you will kill people , david . you have got to stop the bloodshed before it begins .
nurse !
listen to me ! take your own life , david . it is our only chance .
nurse !
the supernatural ! the powers of darkness ! it is all true . take your own life ! suicide , david . join me .
nurse ! oh god ! alex !
you are not real .
what are you doing here ?
i wanted to see you .
okay , you have seen me . now go away .
david , i am sorry i upset you yesterday , but you must understand what is going on .
i understand all right . you are one of the undead and i am a werewolf .
yes .
get out of here , jack !
david , tomorrow night is the full moon . you will change , you will become . . .
a monster . i know , i know .
you must take your own life now , david , before it is too late .
jack , are you really dead ?
what do you think ?
i think i have lost my mind . i think you are not real . i think i am asleep and you are a part of another bad dream .
you must believe me .
what , jack ? that tomorrow night beneath the full moon i will sprout hair and fangs and eat people ? bullshit !
the canines will be real . you will taste real blood ! god damit , david , please believe me ! you will kill and make others like me ! i am not having a nice time , david ! do not allow this to happen again ! you must take your own life !
hi , jack .
what can i say , jack ?
you do not have to say anything .
are not you going to say , i told you so ?
if i was still alive , i probably would .
you look awful .
thank you .
i did not mean it . i do not know what i am saying . i am not even sure it was me who killed those people . i do not remember doing it .
what about the zoo ?
well , even if i am not the wolfman , i am crazy enough to do something like that . i mean , here i sit in leicester square talking to a corpse . i am glad to see you , jack .
david kessler , this is gerald bringsly .
hello .
because this must be stopped .
i could hang myself .
dr . hirsch ?
no , thank you , doctor .
you were saying ?
has david kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors ?
the forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved , that is true , but i hardly think . . .
what can we do to assist you ?
yes ?
lt . villiers and sgt . mcmanus are here to see you , doctor .
excuse me . yes ?
roger mathison , doctor .
what here ?
he is on the telephone .
hello , there . what can i get you ?
campari and soda would do nicely .
sorry , love .
that is that ?
oh , that is been there for two hundred years . we were going to paint it out , but it is traditional , so we left it .
do you have any hot soup ?
hot chocolate ?
we have got spirits and beer . if it is something hot you want , you can have tea .
then you have some hot tea ?
no .
oh .
remember the alamo ?
no , thank you .
sorry .
he may have a point , lieutenant . two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man .
sgt . mcmanus , are you suggesting that david and jack were , in fact , attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of east proctor has conspired to keep it a secret ? we have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police . we have two witnesses to the crime . you will forgive me , mr . kessler , if i consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock .
lieutenant , the boy seems pretty lucid to me and . . .
and what , sergeant ?
i do not rightly know , sir .
i cannot accept a connection between david kessler and last night s murders . we will find him , however . i can assure you of that .
hello , tom .
what do you suppose anybody wants ? money , money , money !
listen , i told you i was not interested in that deal , did not i ?
tom , i never had trouble getting credit from you before . when i was flat broke you gave me all the money i wanted . now i come to you with a swell deal , and the greatest
i will tell you why . i do not like the crowd you are mixed up with . personally , you can have all the credit you want . but for that deal not a cent .
that is the idea of turning her down ? it sounds like a perfectly safe investment .
she is a widow . i do not like taking mortgages from widows .
if she cannot pay , i will have to foreclose , will not i ?
yes sure
oscar , that is the matter ?
i was the first one to see it . i was coming down the stairs , and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet .
no kidding ?
no kidding . when i saw it , you could a knocked me over with a pin .
where is matt ?
matt ?
yeah . he will have a tough time thinking up a wise crack for this one . . .
the detectives got matt up there in sampsongs office .
he has ?
say matt , i will have to have some money for those manville payrolls .
how much ?
about twenty four thousand .
it was more than that last week .
yeah .
say , do me a favor , will you charlie ?
yeah .
let me have ten bucks ?
ten bucks ? say , if i had ten bucks , i would quit .
charlie !
i will pay it back to you saturday on the level i will . give a guy a break , will you ? i have got to get it back in my account . if helen ever finds out that i
whose death ?
it will be yours if you do not kick in with that ten bucks .
say pal , did you ever hear of a depression ?
where you been ?
that is the matter , charlie ?
i am fourteen cents out , and it took me half an hour to find the mistake . and me with a date , too .
i remember once when your account checked .
and listen , wise guy i am setting friend time clock for exactly nine o clock , so no squawks out of you guys in the morning .
mr . dickson in yet ?
not yet , mr . clark .
when he comes in , tell him we are waiting for him in the board room .
yes , sir .
and tell him not to delay .
personally , i think you are getting panic stricken about nothing . dicksongs all right .
do not make me laugh , schultz !
dickson does not have to go . but he must agree to this merger with new york trust
what good will that do ?
how are you protecting your depositors ? by making a lot of idiotic loans !
you know dickson as well as we do . he will shut the doors before he gives up control .
say , you know , i found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball . you have got to hit with the left hand , and from the inside out , it is the only way you can hit anything
i think , mr . dickson , we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning , if you do not mind .
that is the matter with my policy ? how many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty five years ? i will tell you . not a single one ! that is wrong with that kind of banking ?
character , hmmpf ! that is your idea ?
most of the creditors i know personally . i have seen them grow up in the community . i knew their fathers and mothers before them .
i am running this bank my way . get that clear !
gentlemen , you notice mr . dickson refuses to consider our wishes . he refuses an offer to merge with the new york trust the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground . he insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith !
we want to talk to you .
what about ?
we will be forced to shut the doors . i have worked twenty five years night and day to keep this bank alive . you have all made money out of it . are you willing to help ?
what do you mean , help ?
i know that among you , you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city . get that money over here and i will stop this run within five minutes .
that sounds very simple , dickson , but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes ?
the depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you . you thought they were your friends . why do not you go out there now and try and get some help from them ?
aw , they have gone crazy . you cannot reason with a mob .
no . you cannot reason with anyone else when you are in a jam . we pleaded with you to keep liquid , but you would not listen to us . you preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish . now you want our help . you want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you have wrecked . all right . there s one way you can get it . give us an option on your stock and resign as president .
say , you cannot do that
dickson , i would like to talk to you about the bank .
come out here you pawnbrokers take a look at this !
we have been waiting fifteen minutes
i hope you do not mind me asking you a few questions , mr . cluett .
of course , yes . just what would you like to know , inspector ?
where were you at twelve o clock last night ?
that is simple , is not it ? i assume you can prove that if necessary .
oh yes , of course . there was someone with me . a lady .
looks like you are going to have no trouble at all . what was the lady s name , mr . cluett ?
if you do not mind , inspector , i would rather not say that is , unless it becomes absolutely essential . you see , she is married .
oh !
you understand ?
thanks .
somebody must be in good humor . he was humming mother machree .
stand back inspector , or i will shoot . drop that gun .
do not be a fool , cluett . this is only going to make it worse for you .
what were you doing at finlay s this morning ?
i was crazy , i tell you , mr . dickson . i did not know what i was doing . i wandered around in a daze . all i could think of was that they were going to kill me . . . you will stand by me , will not you , mr . dickson ? you will not go back on me now , will you ? i will die if they send me to prison !
do not forget there s a dead watchman downstairs .
i did not kill him ! i had nothing to do with that , i tell you ! i was home in my apartment last night i can prove it !
claims he was there with a married woman . does not want to mention her name .
confessed ! cluett , in heavengs name , what got into you ?
i do not know . it is all been like a crazy nightmare , mr . dickson .
what happened ? you are not a thief . how would you get mixed up with these kind of people ?
gambling i owed them a lot of money . last week i lost over fifty thousand dollars !
fifty thousand dollars !
what was my wife doing in your apartment last night ?
nothing , nothing , mr . dickson . do not pay any attention to me . i do not know what i am saying .
you just mentioned her name . what was she doing there ? what was she doing in your apartment ?
she was not to blame , mr . dickson . it was not her fault . honest , it was not . i begged her to come up . she did not
you know what we do to welchers , cluett , do not you ?
i know , i know , dude . oh , i must have been crazy ! i lost my head completely !
that is your funeral . we have got fifty thousand dollars coming to us .
then what did you want to gamble for ? if you would have beat us out of fifty g s , you would have been paid , would not you ? well , we want our dough .
i am sorry , dude , buti
that do not do us any good .
but after all , you cannot take blood from a stone .
good heavens , man ! you are not suggesting that i
why not ?
why , i could not do that . . . !
what do you mean ?
dude there s not any chance of my becoming involved in this , is there ?
you ? no , you will be all right , so long as you establish an alibi for tonight .
know , but
be sure you are with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked . understand ?
but dude , listen could not we make this some other time ?
this will not do . not during business hours . . .
what is the matter with you ? you are trembling ?
am i ? why , i i do not know any reason why i should be , unless of course it is you . . .
me ?
being alone with you has always done this to me . you know that .
for a celebrated bounder , that is an awful admission . besides , i never knew that any female could do this to you .
well , you can . you always could .
here , here , here , now ! do not you go back to work on me , too . i am getting tired of this . besides , it is beginning to affect your looks
what is ?
running around . not your work . you would better start reforming , cyril !
if i thought you were the slightest bit interested , i would .
not bad , not bad at all . do you know something ? i have always been curious about your line .
line ?
come on cyril , try a little bit of it out on me . i have not had any first class blarney thrown at me since the day i was married .
but you see , it is not blarney where you are concerned .
does not that come next ?
yes , yes , it does . what are you doing tonight , phyllis ?
oh ! oh , no ! i think i have done enough experimenting for one day . congratulations , cyril . you have convinced me that you are a philanderer of the very first order . i shall recommend you highly .
but i am giving a party for him a real , old fashioned surprise party . caps , bells , whistles , and everything . i am really terribly excited about it . i have been planning it for months .
well
well , what ?
well , are not you going to invite me ?
you ? no can do . it is all set . just a few of tom s closest friends .
now phyllis , if you do not invite me , i am coming anyway .
do not be silly , cyril . these are respectable people . they would probably bore you to death .
no , they will not . not when you are there . oh , please , be a sport . please ask me .
why are you so anxious ?
do not you know ?
no .
what ?
do not you know i have been crazy about you for years ?
now wait a minute , wait a minute . . .
i have loved you ever since i can remember , long before you married tom dickson .
why , cyril , you are insane
no . no , i am not . i deliberately avoided you . i was afraid of making a fool of myself . but i will not stand it any longer
that is this ?
my apartment .
i knew i could not trust you . you told me you were taking me home .
come on up for just a few minutes . we will have just one drink , then we will go .
no . i know the answer to that one . i think you would better take me home .
that is the matter ? afraid papa will spank ?
no . no , i am afraid papa is not that much interested . he is too busy rushing off to philadelphia to make stuffy , old speeches at stuffy , old bankers meetings . too busy closing big , important deals i think i will have a drink .
you know , there ought to be a congressional medal for men like you . america s comfort to misunderstood wives . i never thought i would find myself in that class .
oh , you are not so badly off . there s something much worse than being a misunderstood wife .
what is that , mr . bones ?
and now fair woman , i have you in my power .
i am not afraid of you . you have not got a moustache !
why , matt !
are the payrolls ready for tomorrow ?
yes , sir .
let me see your cash book , will you ?
now ?
the butler said i could stay . i told him it was important .
well , i thought i would like to have a little talk with you .
i am listening .
anything you have to say to me , you can say in the morning .
i am not interested in what you think .
you have no right to do this to her , mr . cluett . why do not you think it over ? it is only gonna get you into a lot of trouble .
i tell you , i am not interested in your opinion .
phyllis , you do not have to explain anything . you would do well to mind your own business .
this is my business . mr . dicksongs been like a father to me . what has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this ?
that will be just about enough ! now get out of here !
good morning , mr . dickson .
john , how is your wife this morning ?
much better this morning , thank you .
excuse me
wait a minute . how do you feel this morning ?
i am feeling fine this morning .
that makes it unanimous . i feel all right too .
shall we let the people come in ?
good morning , mr . dickson . my wife is much better this morning .
well , look who s here ! hello , dear .
if this is not a red letter day for tom dickson ! first i trample on the board of directors , then i promote matt here to assistant cashier , and now to complete the day i have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife . what a man , what a man !
it is amazing that your sweet , lovely , gorgeous wife can ever get to see you .
that is the matter dear ? what have i done now ?
nothing . tom , i thought you were going out with me tonight .
oh , i did have a date with you tonight , did not i ?
yes .
now tom , you simply cannot go to philadelphia tonight . that is all there is to it .
but i have to go , dear . it is a very important banker s meeting .
i do not care whether it is important or not . you said you were going out with me , and if you had not promised so faithfully , i would not have gone and planned the whole thing .
listen , it is not so terribly important . we can go to the theatre any time .
the theatre ?
that is what it was you planned , was not it ?
yes , of course .
you can take some of the girls . you can take mildred or gwynn
ho ! ho ! ho !
ho , ho , ho , yourself ! i would not laugh if i were you . you may not suspect it , but i am still attractive to some .
listen , do not go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
well . . .
do not you forget that i am still the head man around here too . now we will get the tickets changed for tomorrow night . you and i are going out together . how is that ?
all right . i will postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night .
happy now ?
listen , dear . i want to ask you something . i know it is a silly thing for me to ask you , but . . . i want you to tell me the truth . where were you last night ?
last night ? er why uh , last night . . .
listen , dear . now tell me the truth about this . were you in cluett s apartment ?
good morning .

good morning , mrs . pembroke .
good morning , mr . dickson .

yes , thank you .
mr . dickson ?
but , mr . dickson , i thought you were going to take care of the mortgage . i only want ten thousand . the property is worth sixty .
wait a minute . where is your uniform ?
i have not any .
you have not got a uniform ?
no , sir .
my goodness , you ought to have a uniform . how much does one cost ?
why , i do not know .
oh , make that uniform blue .
well , well , well got your uniform , eh ?
yes , sir .
looks good . how much did it cost ?
it is all right . thanks .
that is the matter ? you do not seem very excited about it .
sure , i think it is swell .
aw , i am sorry , mr . dickson . it is just kind of sudden , that is all . sure , i am excited . i think it is great . only , well , you have done so much for me already . . . i will never be able to thank you enough .
aw , go on , forget it . you came through , did not you ? that is all i wanted . a lot of them did not think you would . you do not know how much satisfaction it is been to me . it is been swell . well , when are you and helen going to get married ?
well , i
i already told him i was home .
wait a minute . wait a minute . matt , do you realize you are up against something ? you are being charged with murder . it is serious , son . now come on , i know you did not do it . but we have got to make them believe it . come on , tell the truth , where were you last night ?
no . i will not .
you are protecting somebody .
no , i am not mr . dickson !
we have not got much time left , mr . dickson . we have got to do something quick or it will be too late .
why would not you tell me where you were last night ?
you are not giving up , are you , mr . dickson ?
were you in cluett s apartment ?
oh , i can explain about that later . you are losing your bank do not you realize what that means ?
was mrs . dickson there ?
listen , mr . dickson , do not let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down . you have got more friends than anybody in this town . little guys guys who would not be in business if it were not for you . all you have got to do is
wait a minute . answer my question . was mrs . dickson there ?
well . . . uh . . . i . . .
she was , was not she ? how long has this been going on ? do you know ?
aw , i do not know what you are talking about . all i know is that you are losing your bank and
i want you both to take the day off . go downtown and get a license and get married right away !
but i have not . . .
helen , while you are downtown , you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the berengaria sailing next week .
that is the matter ? that is going on here ? this is ridiculous ! you cannot hold this boy on a vague suspicion .
i am afraid i must , mr . dickson .
why pick on him ?
it is an inside job . that is a cinch . whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout . now brown , here , is in charge of the vaults , is not he ?
what time did this thing happen ?
the clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at .
all right . if the boy proves an alibi , he is all right , is not he ?
if he can do it , yes .
that is what he says . i got a man from headquarters checking up on it now .
all i know is the bank s been robbed and a murder s been committed . the way i see it , brown here looks guilty .
what are you talking about ? he had no more to do with it than you did .
maybe . but i am taking no chances . why , this kid s got a record .
of course it is true and he knows it .
you were right , mr . dickson ! brown did not have anything to do with it . here s your man .
why , you must be crazy . i have known this man for years .
my wife ? that is she got to do with you ?
you are lying !
do not worry , mr . dickson . we will find out whether he is telling the truth . i will have a man from headquarters check up on it right away .
well , sampson , what is it ?
good . i will take this along with me . tell clyde i will see him tomorrow . i am sick and tired of the delay .
i am afraid he is been stalling .
that is just exactly what he has been doing . this deal should have been closed weeks ago . tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
he says he cannot get away in the daytime .
how about his nights ? he is too busy running around . tell him to keep tomorrow night open , come in and sign this thing , or i will call this whole deal off .
the lobby s half filled now .
they have been coming in steady all morning . i have called for some extra police .
all right . send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away .
the bank s reputation would not be worth a nickel after that . this is just a flurry , that is all . they have heard about the robbery and got panic stricken . listen , get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash . wait a minute . get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too . tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot .
look at them , mr . dickson . they are going crazy .
did you get the case for the securities ?
yes , sir .
mine too ?
the fools ! if they only knew it , they are making things worse for themselves . somebody starts a silly rumor , and they lose their heads .
what will we do ?
we cannot keep open till four o clock . we have not cash enough to last an hour .
mr . dickson ! mr . dickson !
get all the big bills in the place . take them out and get them changed . get nothing but ones and fives . distribute them among the tellers . tell them to take their time . stall as much as possible . count and recount the money .
yes , sir .
yes , ma am , you can deposit your money here .
is it safe ?
absolutely .
quiet down , please ! take it easy , folks . everything will be all right .
but you said it would be safe ! it is his life insurance money . oh , please , i will go to the old ladies home if you do not do something , please !
how do you do , mrs . dickson .
is that busy husband of mine busy ?
he is at a board meeting .
board meeting . oh , that means hours , i suppose .
i am afraid so .
helen , did you ever try competing with a bank ?
no .
well , take my word for it , and do not try it . it is useless ! if it were some other woman , i could handle her , but after all , you cannot scratch a bank s eyes out now , can you ?
oh , well . i guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite . when he comes out , you tell him i will be back . he has not gotten rid of me !
hello , helen !
matt , come here !
why ?
hey , look out , somebody s likely to see us !
what did you do with it ?
with what ?
the ten dollars .
oh , ten dollars
yes .
no .
oh , you think i am lying ?
yes .
all right , i am lying . do not forget you called me a liar .
say , i just heard the merger is not going thru . is not that grand ?
what happened ? what did he say ? did you get the job ?
that is the matter , matt ? gee , i thought you would be thrilled to death .
come here . you know , a few minutes ago i was in cluett s office and mrs . dickson was there .
well . . . ?
oh matt , you must be mistaken .
in cluett s office ?
that is keeping you ?
oh , charlie again .
say matt , you have not done anything about what you saw today , have you ?
who ? cluett ? no , not yet . but i would like to take a crack at that stiff necked , horse dollar .
oh now , do not be silly .
can you imagine that guy ? he was kissing her .
now you have got me worried , dear . promise me you will not butt in .
shh . . . ! i will wait for you upstairs .
oh , matt . . .
that is he doing , honey ? is he getting any help ?
something s happened . he is not trying anymore .
they must have turned him down .
yes . he called some of the biggest people in town .
did you talk to him ?
dicksongs in a jam i tell you . the rungs getting worse .
mr . williams . . .
the big guys have got the screws on him . you have got to come through for him , mr . conway . he came through for you a hundred times . if his friends do not help him , who is going to help him ?
did you say dude finlay ?
yes , why ?
he was in the bank yesterday .
he was here ?
he came to see mr . cluett .
are you sure ?
what did you find out , mike ?
i have been trailing the cashier like you told me . you are right about that guy , chief . there s something screwy somewhere .
never mind all that . what did you find out ?
he left here about an hour ago and went down to dude finlay s joint .
dude finlay ?
do you know this young man , mrs . halligan ?
for the rheumatism , you know .
what time was it , mrs . halligan ?
what time was it ?
huh ?
what time did matt brown get in ?
now , let me see a half hour after the dooley sisters and the dooley sisters never get home until after
i do not care about the dooley sisters what time did he get in ?
that is just what i am trying to tell you , sir . it was a half hour after the dooley sisters . . .
yes , i guess it was one , cause . . .
it could not have been earlier ?
no . it was not earlier because . . .
yes , i know . cause the dooley sisters were not in yet .
no because me clock struck four , and when it strikes four , it is one .
listen here , young man nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it
you turned off the burglar alarm , you set the time clock , came back at twelve and emptied the boxes , did not you ?
was not anywhere near this place
sit down ! when the watchman surprised you , you shot him what would you do with the gun ?
i did not do it ! i have not got a gun !
then who changed it ?
so you were home last night ?
yes .
what time did you get in ?
well , about uh eleven o clock .
eleven o clock , eh ? are you sure it was that ?
but i was not here , mr . dickson . honest i was not . . .
you are carrying too much money on you , hank . you better turn some in tonight .
how are you fixed ?
i am okay , matt .
that mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar .
yeah , what did he do with his first one ?
everybody in ?
i guess so .
where is charlie ?
certainly , mr . jones ! certainly ! charlie !
you can ride like that ?
i think i may just go on to the reservation .
i could not lose him .
this is healing ?
sometimes a wound will kill .
gatling ! they have got a gatling !
he is smiling .
never thought that pissant town would look so pretty .
your ma would not let us leave until we ate something .
here s liberty s favorite son ! i will never forget what you did , cousin .
our place , clell miller s , sammy johnston , the creeders . will hite .
the sheriff says it was a gang of drunk kansas boys .
these are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad .
uhh , yeah it does .
no , jimmy has a point . the younger james gang could be confusing .
how ?
we got a problem here , brother ?
that is what the newspapers say . were not for jesse james , this gang would not be able to find a goat s ass with a stick .
this is the best score yet .
it is still taking too long . the people used to snap to .
that was because of . . . the reputation the gang had .
as long as people think jesse s still riding , we will never get the respect we deserve .
cole , we are outlaws . not exactly the most respectable job , if you know what i mean .
how would they
what have you done ?
i ai not done
bob . i did not . . .
swear .
i swear
i am sorry , cole .
things changed when you quit the gang . for example , i am now the one who says let s ride .
he is not bad at it .
my plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine , thank you .
yesterday .
corn gonna shoot at me ?
nope .
jesus mercy , that is charlie higgins , dave laller . . .
cole , i want to get to the farm , make sure little jim and the girls are okay .
they came up , made the same offer they made you folks . our little brother jim tried to chase em off , one of those detectives hit him in the head , knocked him out . cole lost his temper .
oh no . . .
damn !
they said because the detectives were working for the department of the interior
the army can hang him .
home . we go home . we ride like hell to get there , and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes . and when we get there we stay there and god help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again .
how many of them did he kill ?
you have no shame .
but if we take their money and supplies . . .
all right , settle down . all this money ai not ours .
well , no , jesse , it was the bank s . that is why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it . you explain it to him .
the outlaws calling themselves the james younger gang shot their way out of town , wounding the sherriff and three other townsfolk .
hey !
okay , folks , i think we know how this is going to go . . .
beg pardon ?
this is about the wanted ! posters , is not it .
the things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here . . .
you are a fine figure of a man .
listen , jesse , we have got a problem . it is cole .
he is been full of vinegar lately .
he is planning a job .
what ?
listen , he is my brother and i do not want to start trouble . . .
what ?
what you saying boy ?
i think i recognize you .
how ?
you shut up now , boy .
about time you got here , buddy .
ride with me , cousin ?
i could use the walk .
where you boys going ?
home , boys . back to our farms .
hands off your hip , cole .
you are not scared , are you ?
not now .
what is wrong with you ?
you ever notice zerelda s eyes ?
she had a moustache .
she was european !
thanks for the help .
after all you did on our farm ? you miss it , do not you jesse ?
the war ? what , are you crazy ? there are things i miss about it .
it was exciting .
because we were good at it ? hell , we were great at it . jesse , do not tell anyone i said this , because everybody knows i am the toughest man in this town , but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns .
this is not a feud , this is war . they have got more men than we do . we kill detectives , they can replace em in a day .
so what do we do , general lee ?
i will pick the first job ! i mean . . . i know a girl down at the bank . see if she cannot get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money .
perfect , cole .
the james younger gang .
sorry .
i got seven thousand .
see , frank s being smart about this .
it is not a bank .
the fidelity bank and trust was robbed on tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men .
jesse , we got to have a word .
sure , cousin .
all the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the james younger gang .
yep .
this is your fault for hogging all the publicity .
it will be the biggest score yet .
smells funny , it being mentioned in the paper .
if you would read about it first , you would have no problems .
what are you saying ?
i have robbed just as many banks as you have ! i know this town , and i know this bank , and i say it is an easy job .
beautiful .
now the one time one of us comes up with an idea
a bad idea .
i got us through the war all right .
and almost got hanged in peacetime .
i am the better soldier , jesse .
still smells fishy .
fine . we hit this bank .
dammit !
okay , you are gonna rest here .
bob , rip up some bandages .
we will make them pay for this .
i am out .
what ? ! we follow you for a year , and now that our blood s been spilled , you are gonna quit ? !
missed you , cousin .
you know , you getting caught , right after leaving us , some people thought
where would you get all these riders ?
some indian tracker you turned out to be , tom .
wait will we get back to missouri , start telling those gals about how little jesse james charged the whole union army by himself !
tom , why do not you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation ? figure we might have some work for you , if you want .
hmm . go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack , or work for you . . .
well ?
cannon or gatling ?
both would be nice .
what the
i think one of em s glass .
which one , right or left ?
oh , lord , the dance hall girl at bunty s . . .
i have no idea what you just said , but it sounded real nice .
shakespeare . he is european .
bastards ! come back here and face me !
hey ! we decide something , that is it ! we are in this for the long haul , and this idea of me and jesse s will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneaking up on us in our sleep . we have got to think
strategically .
jesse .
oh , you are in charge ? we ai not partners any more , jesse ? you tell cole younger where and when to ride ?
another dozen out back .
they gonna rush us ?
the safe . now .
of course ! uh , sir ?
what ?
where is jesse james ?
open the damn safe !
you um big lawman ?
yeah , injun . what do you want ?
great chief of st . louis send me .
of st . louis ?
ho yah . him say tell big lawman in carville that badman jesse james riding toward rising sun , above great river , near eagle rock .
east ? east above the river heading for the eagle pass ?
go ahead to the saloon . but do not get too drunk !
i know it ai not no durned bank holiday !
you are right , sir .
then why cannot i go in there ?
on account of we are robbing it .
oh . why did not you just say so ?
it is a secret .
fine . i will just wait here .
what the
what is it ?
old man tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank .
so ?
where the hell were you ?
i had you covered . from back there .
rode right into them , screaming like a banshee .
my little web did that ?
web died fighting ?
boys . . .
what do you say , sir ?
you know you are welcome any time !
yesss , but i was thinking , i could come by , and then take zee out . some place near . with other folk . near . here . but out .
daddy , do not start with this again .
he is going to be fine , right daddy ?
they are gone . what are you
i fooled them into thinking i was alone .
well , i hope the boy pulls through . we should know in the morning .
he thinks this is some kind of game !
every time i put my head up to hit that gatling , they try to shoot it off .
distracting enough for you ?
pff . they hardly even noticed you .
so you are saying i could have done more to attract their attention .
mm hmm .
such as ?
you could have worn one of those big , floppy womangs easter sunday hats .
that would have made an impression .
i figure .
see , that is your problem , frank . by the time you finish figuring out stuff , i am already finished doing it .
web s dead .
i reckoned .
hell of a war .
hello , liberty missoura !
looks like web mimms was not the only casualty this towngs got .
frank , do not you have something to say ?
you are doing just fine .
whyyyy . . . he took down the gatling gun and the cannon all by himself .
all we thought about was coming home . i swore i would kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again . if i have to go to war with the railroad to stay , fine by me .
think about this . if we just come up with a story and stick to it , we should be all right .
that just might work .
big and older ?
you can shut up now .
you are a charmer .
i swear i will shoot you in your sleep .
she is still talking to jesus .
if you stop saying things about my zee .
you know him ?
i went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed . the railroad does not even need our land , they are just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can .
you ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming ?
what do you think ?
you are looking a bit more spry now that somebody
pinkertons . it is the railroad .
. . . we could move on . rebuild . make a decent life someplace else .
do not care .
did not think you would . i am going to go make the coffin .
how would it go in there ?
fine . how would it go out here ?
and i planned getting you off the hangmangs deck
and it is guarded by pinkerton detectives .
i do not think it is counterfeit . do you mind if i take a look at all your real bills to compare ?
gents , we are in the middle of something here .
bob s upset .
pardon the delay , folks , but we had to get mad bob younger under control !
this has been a good year .
jesse , we are outlaws .
and we are good at it .
it got to you , did not it . all the killing in the war . you need it now .
you have killed your fair share of men .
if i could go back to farming
that is a lie . you could have bought a dozen farms with the money we have stolen .
i cannot quit and leave you alone . i cannot quit until you quit . ma would have wanted it that way .
we are doing this for ma .
maybe it started out that way . but now . . .
what do you want me to say , frank ? i was killing men when i was fifteen . i like getting shot at . i like riding out of town with a posse at my back . this is a helluva better life than farming .
we are drunk .
oh yeah .
you taking sides against me , now , frank ?
they are all pinned down . cannot even get to the door .
shoulda learned with web . made it look fun , made it look like an adventure . got web killed . now jim .
jim was old enough . . .
he was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the west . how was he supposed to say no to that ?
railroad burned him out too . you could not have stopped him .
you are a piss poor liar for the smartest man i know .
yeah .
a war against the railroad . what the hell were we thinking ?
i will meet you down there in a few weeks .
see you soon . oh , and i appreciate the distraction back there .
y know , uncle frank . . .
yeah , jimmy ?
. . . every time you tell that story , you stop there . that is not how it ended . i was five when my dad got shot .
allow a man his version of the past . when you get to be my age , you have got enough painful memories , you are allowed to soften a few of the edges up .
sounds like he was a hell of a man .
that he was .
they are making him a hero now .
saved a lot of folk from the railroad .
but he killed a lot of men , too .
cannot argue that .
so what was he ?
uncle frank ?
yeah jimmy ?
how much of that story is true ?
did you kill yankees ?
a fair number , ma .
ma , i am glad to see you being nice to our injun friend .
easterners .
the lord says we can bury em out back in the orchard , nobody will ever find them .
ma ! please !
riders
we know , ma . now we got to get you to doc mimms .
doc mimms will
zerelda ? little zee mimms ?
you were little jesse james when you left .
but still died .
jesse , are you awake ?
jesse , is that your hand ?
you should not be up .
i have been on my back two weeks . i am sick of it .
you are sick of my company ?
no ! i mean , of course not . no .
teasing you is completely unfair .
what you do to me is unfair . the teasing , i mean .
i should not tease a hero .
what ?
everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued cole . we are all so proud of you , jesse . and not a single farm s been sold to the railroad since . you are everybody s hero .
i was not the only one risking my neck that day .
so you are saying i should leave you alone and go spend time with jimmy younger ?
i used to come to this tree when i was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when i got older .
you did not want to farm ?
i was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate .
a river pirate .
arr . hand over your jewels , missy .
thank god you grew out of that . you did grow out of that , did not you ?
mostly . it would be an all right life , for a bachelor .
you planning on being a bachelor your whole life , jesse james ?
not if i find the right girl .
and that is this right girl like ?
smart . funny . bossy . always makes me think she is two steps ahead of me . and big buck teeth .
where will you find such a girl ?
ahem . from this doctrine . . . no , ah . . . from womengs eyes this doctrine i derive , they sparkle still like . . . shiny . . . sparkling rocks . . .
sparkling rocks ?
little ones .
is this one of frank s shakespeare poems you are trying to quote ?
yep .
were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting ?
i am so sorry , jesse .
you and i , we have started . . . something , you know ? i do not know what will happen if you do this .
me neither .
let the law
laws do not touch men like thaddeus rains . only justice does .
whose justice ? yours or god s ? when will you stop ?
zee .
jesse . what are you thinking ? there are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county !
i do not understand .
she is the most wonderful woman in the world . cannot get her out of my mind .
that is . . . wonderful . it is just . . . i thought . . .
i would never have imagined us in a place like this .
that is why i picked it . we can start a whole new life down here .
are you going to be happy here , mr . james ? without all that excitement ?
i have got you . you keep me busy . i figure we will get over to the hotel . . . get checked in , cleaned up . . . then i would like to do something i have been thinking about for a long time .
hmm .
hmm what ?
i beg your pardon ?
blazing guns of the west . true stories of jesse james . only a dime in the hotel lobby .
let me see that .
oh , i am not finished . when he sauntered into a saloon , his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold , the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple . as i said . hmm .
now , sweetie , y all would not go believing one of them silly dime novels , would you ?
jesse , have you ever noticed that when you are trying to charm your way out of trouble , your accent gets all farm boy ?
aw , shucks , ma am . . .
stop it . this is just sad .
do not turn around .
what ?
you get arrested again , i will kill you .
yes ma am .
i cannot believe i had to blow up a train for you .
you are a hell of a woman .
do not swear .
tennessee ?
we are moving you tomorrow .
but i like the presidential suite .
oh , it is a similar room . but the hotel is in washington d . c . you are not going to get a fair trial down here , in front of a jury of jesse james sympathizers .
so i will get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by thaddeus rains ?
did you order our houses burned down ?
you almost ended my career before it began .
how did you spot the ambush in torrell ?
last february ?
mmm .
you had all those cattle there , so i would think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive ?
yes ?
the cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town .
almost got me in billings . i saw you there , shooting at me .
i went myself to oversee the operation . did not help much .
oh . that is nice to know . we are going to hang you , you know .
i figured .
was it worth it ?
should have just killed thaddeus rains and been done with it .
that is what i would have done .
i am not hanged yet .
you cocky little bastard .
ahh , you will miss me .
that was for my ma . now this is for everybody else .
the railroad has no business in tennessee . therefore i have no interest in the state of tennessee .
thanks .
i would just as soon kill you , jesse james . but chasing you takes up too much of my time .
this is unusual . most of our marriages are members of the congregation .
the lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable . jesse woodson james . jesse james ? the jesse james ?
i could have lied i suppose , but i want this marriage to be legal . i just want you to know , i am trying to start a new life here . i am depending on your . . .
discretion ? sir , i am a man of the cloth .
thank you .
now let s have a drink .
right here in church ?
and you are too young .
i am the same age you were when you went off to war .
i like that .
you okay , jesse ?
yeah . hey , are you drinking whisky ? you are too young to be drinking whisky .
not too young to shoot a man , not to young to drink .
i guess so .
jim , you been with a girl yet ?
well , not exactly .
you been with a girl ever ?
hell yeah ! i been with . . . uh , not exactly . it is just , i do not want to get one of these paid ladies , you know ?
i think so .
you and frank and cole , and even bob , get all these girls because you are good looking and famous . you do not have to pay . they just look at me like i am the baby brother . do not tell anyone , okay jesse ?
i swear .
tell you something else . i cannot drink that good neither . i am going to go outside and throw up .
what about that rock island bastard ?
. . . too young for whisky . . .
this time we will make an exception .
jesse , you explain to lyla . my girl , you know , from that time . . .
why , yeah .
i hope you do not mind , jesse james told me your name .
oh , you were talking to jesse .
really ?
i hope i am not being too forward .
not at all .
i just though you were awful cute .
thank you , miss ?
lyla devereux .
gosh , that is a pretty name . buy you a drink ?
could we go upstairs and talk ? it is so loud down here .
why do not we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk ?
devereux . my brother cole dated a european girl once .
really ?
well , this land is about to be condemned .
relax , alan . the army has this all in hand . and mr . thaddeus rains will be very pleased with this news . nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate .
my professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time .
they had to be dealt with !
how can that be ?
there s only four of them . . .
mr . thaddeus rains , sir , it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field .
and it is my pleasure to be here .
really !
no ! it is not my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their pathetic little mudholes so that i may build the greatest railroad that this country has ever seen !
parker , tell me that is going on so i can return as quickly as possible to boston and my whores and cigars , not necessarily in that order .
two weeks ago , we managed to arrange to have the army hang one of the local farmers .
good .
unfortunately not , sir . a gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows . not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers , the redoubtable mr . alan pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident .
leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers .
yes sir .
just perfect .
a further impediment is that the army garrison has been ordered to move on from liberty . we will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers .
you see the army leaving and you see the loss of a tool . i see a power void to be filled . as we have the most power , we may move with impunity .
i see . i will get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight .
they exchanged fire with the pinkerton guards , killing several of them . then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile .
how much did they get from the safe ?
thirty five thousand , sir . coins and currency . and the delay from the miles of destroyed track
i will kill them for blowing up my railway !
to be precise , they did not blow up the tracks .
then who did ? !
your men knew the risks .
with my money !
the final route for the railroad is complete .
parker .
sir ?
what is that ?
that .
this is him .
how did you know ?
look at this , pinkerton ! they got the payroll , and this damage will set construction back two months at least .
you would not have done that ?
oh no , i would have done that . but i would have made sure i killed them , too .
i want them arrested and hanged !
would a jury around here convict their own ? i think not . we are beginning an interesting game here , mr . rains .
this is no game .
a rock island and pacific railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside st . louis , missouri . the brave and daring james younger gang was heavily outnumbered by pinkerton detectives , but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the west .
it is a nice piece of writing .
the gang made off with thirty five thousand dollars and also destroyed the thaxton switch construction , meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land ! who wrote this ! ? i will see him hanged every tuesday for a month !
it is early in the game yet , mr . rains . jesse james and i are just learning how each other moves , feeling out each other s patterns .
i am losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers !
hardly farmers . i have done some checking . all these were in the war . these men know sabotage , tactics , and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them . they are disciplined , well trained and have a charismatic leader . if i were to design the perfect outlaw band , this gang is what i would create .
so you cannot tell me anything ?
pinkerton . it is been eight months . i see robberies . i see hold ups . but i do not see men on the end of nooses .
first of all you , shut up . now , you have given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover . every time the james gang strikes , we shift a hundred detectives to that area . but there s just too much open land , too many riverbeds to ride , caves to hide in . this gang operates across four states , often riding a hundred miles between jobs .
i cannot believe this .
yes , that is the way to win the locals back to our side .
i demand action .
no , you demand results . they are not the same thing . and if you want results , you will let me do my job as i see fit . unless of course , you want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it ?
cannot you tell me anything ?
so he is won .
every three months , the james gang circles back to the vicinity of liberty , missouri . they always pull a job right before they return , probably to have extra money to give family and friends .
in english , pinkerton .
there are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed .
can you put men at all four ?
no need . i have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank .
what is that ?
what the hell is that sound ?
listen , what are you doing tonight ?
what ? oh , i am . . . busy .
listen , you are dating luis , he is in arizona . you are fucking me , and we have not made plans . what could you possibly be up to tonight ?
stop it . i am . . .
on a lot of lithium ?
waiting for luis to call me . he said he would call tonight . oh do not be difficult , patrick .
you should come have dinner with me . courtney but when ?
am i confused or were we talking about tonight ?
ummm . . yeah . luis is calling me tonight . i need to be home for that .
pumpkin ?
yes ?
pumpkin you are dating an asshole .
uh huh .
pumpkin you are dating the biggest dickweed in new york .
i know . stop it .
pumpkin , you are dating a tumbling , tumbling dickweed .
patrick do not call me pumpkin anymore , okay ? i have to go .
courtney ? dinner ?
i cannot .
i am thinking dorsia .
dorsia s nice .
nice ?
you like it there , do not you ?
the question is do you like it , courtney ? and will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight .
okay . yeah . what time ?
eight ?
pick me up ?
a facial at elizabeth arden , which was really relaxing , then to the pottery bam where i bought this silver muffin dish .
is that donald trump s car ?
oh god , patrick . shut up .
you know , courtney , you should take some more lithium . or have a diet coke . some caffeine might get you out of this slump .
j b . straight .
champagne on the rocks . oh could i have that with a twist ? she starts to sink back in her chair and bateman leans over and pulls her back up .
are we here ?
yes .
this is dorsia ?
courtney , you are going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash . new york magazine called it a playful but mysterious little dish . you will love it . and then . . . the red snapper with violets and pine nuts . i think that will follow nicely .
luis is a despicable twit .
no , you idiot . i said is it a receptacle tip ? not , is luis a despicable twit . is it a receptacle tip ? get off me .
is it a what ?
pull out .
i am ignoring you .
pull out , goddamnit !
it is a plain end . i think .
oh jesus . i am going home .
patrick . turn on the light . he turns on the light .
it is a plain end , see ? so ?
take it off .
why ?
oh christ , this really is not worth it . and see , courtney , it is there for what ? huh ? tell us . why is it pulled down half an inch ? so it can catch the force of the ejaculate !
see ? happy ? you dumb bitch ? are you happy , you dumb bitch ?
will you call me before thanksgiving ?
what are you doing tonight ?
dinner at the river cafe . au bar afterwards , maybe .
that is nice .
you and . . . luis ?
we were supposed to have dinner at tad and maura s , but you know how luis is . . .
i never knew you smoked .
listen . . . patrick . can we talk ?
you look marvelous . there s nothing to say . you are going to marry luis . next week , no less .
is not that special ? patrick ?
patrick ?
yes ?
i have not seen you around here .
you just have not been looking .
do you want to come to my apartment or not ?
i am not supposed to . but i can make an exception .
you have a really nice place here . . . paul . how much did you pay for it ?
i am not so sure about this . i had to go to emergency after last time . . .
oh this will not be anything like last time , i promise .
nothing like last time , promise .
so , you are looking great , how have you been ?
well , i actually might need a little surgery after last time .
really ?
my friend told me i should maybe even get a lawyer .
this is nicer than your other apartment .
marzipan . pink tents . hundreds , thousands of roses . photographers . annie leibovitz . we will get annie leibovitz . and we will hire someone to videotape . patrick , we should do it .
do . . . what .
get married . have a wedding .
evelyn ?
yes , darling ?
is your evian spiked ?
we should do it .
no i cannot take the time off work .
your father practically owns the company . you can do anything you like , silly .
i do not want to talk about it .
well , you hate that job anyway . why do not you just quit ? you do not have to work .
pat , this is my cousin vanden and her boyfriend stash . he is an artist .
why don t you just go for price ?
oh god , patrick . why price ? price ?
he is rich .
everybody s rich .
he is good looking .
everybody s good looking , patrick .
he has a great body
are you using minoxidil ?
no . i am not . why should i ?
your hairline looks like it is receding .
i want a firm commitment .
why ? that is wrong ?
we need to talk .
talk about what , patrick ? what is there to talk about ?
it is over , evelyn . it is all over
touchy , touchy . i am sorry i brought the wedding up . let s just avoid the issue , alright ? now , are we having coffee ?
i am fucking serious . it is fucking over . us . this is no joke . i do not think we should see each other anymore .
but your friends are my friends . my friends are your friends . i do not think it would work . you have a little something on your upper lip .
you are really serious , are not you ?
yes , i am .
but what about the past ? our past ?
we never really shared one .
you are inhuman .
no , no , no .
if you really want to do something for me , you can stop making this scene right now .
oh god , i cannot believe this .
where are you going ?
i am just leaving .
but where ?
you will notice that my friends and i all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion , but there are subtle differences between us . mcdermott is the biggest asshole . van patten is the yes man . price is the most wired . i am the best looking . we all have light tans . right now i am in a bad mood because this is not a good table , and van patten keeps asking dumb , obvious questions about how to dress .
picked them up from the printers yesterday
good coloring .
eggshell with romalian type . what do you think ?
but laurie kennedy is a total hardbody . what do you think , bateman ?
because he dated her .
how did you guess ?
girls dig bateman . he is cq . you are total cq , bateman .
do you know what ed gein said about women ?
ed gein ? maitre d at canal bar ?

no , he does not .
are you sure ?
you saw the ad in the times ?
no . yes . i mean yes , i did . in the times . but . . . does not paul owen still live here ?
i think you should go now .
but i think . . . i want to know what happened here .
do not come back .
excuse me , gentlemen . right back . he approaches carnes cautiously .
jesus , davis . yes . that was hilarious . that was you , was not it ?
yes , naturally .
it was a pretty long message , was not it ?
what exactly do you mean ?
by the way davis , how is cynthia ? you are still seeing her , right ?
carnes ? wait .
davis . i am not one to bad mouth anyone , your joke was amusing . but come on , man , you had one fatal flaw batemangs such a dork , such a boring , spineless lightweight , that i could not fully appreciate it . i was not fooled for a second . now , if you would said price , or mcdermott . . . otherwise , it was amusing . now , let s have lunch or dinner or something . hilarious , davis . a killer .
what are you talking about ? bateman is what ?
now , if you will excuse me , i really must . . .
wait . stop . you do not seem to understand . you are not really comprehending any of this . i killed him . i did it , carnes . i am patrick bateman . i chopped owengs fucking head off . i tortured dozens of girls . the whole message i left on your machine was true .
excuse me . i really must he going .
now , carnes , listen to me . listen very , very carefully . i killed paul owen and i liked it . i cannot make myself any clearer
but that is simply not possible . and i do not find this funny anymore .
it never was supposed to he ! why is not it possible ?
it is just not .
because i had dinner with paul owen twice in london . . . just ten days ago .
no , you . . . did not ?
patrick , thanks so much for looking after courtney . dorsia , how impressive ! how on earth did you get a reservation there ?
lucky , i guess .
that is a wonderful jacket . let me guess , valentino couture ?
uh huh .
it looks so soft .
patrick ? is that you ?
no , luis . it is not me . you are mistaken .
this is gwendolyn ichiban . this is my very good friend patrick bateman . where are you going ? we are going to nell s . gwendolyngs father s buying it . where did you get your overnight bag ?
call me please , patrick .
what . . . is . . . it ?
where are you going ?
i have gotta . . . i have gotta . . . return some videotapes .
patrick ?
van patten looks puffy . has he stopped working out ?
that is paul owen .
there s this theory out now that if you can catch the aids virus through having sex with someone who is infected , then you can also catch anything alzheimer s , muscular dystrophy , hemophilia , leukemia , diabetes , dyslexia , for christ s sake you can get dyslexia from pussy
i am not sure , guy , but i do not think dyslexia is a virus .
jeez . that is not a helluva lot , is it ?
maybe it is just the light .
is he fucking selling it by the milligram ? oh my god . . .
what ?
it is definitely weak but i have a feeling if we do enough of it we will be okay .
shut up !
calm down . let s do it anyway
oh come on . price . there are a lot more important problems than sri lanka to worry about . sure our foreign policy is important , but there are more pressing problems at hand .
like what ?
that is that , a gram ?
i cannot believe that price prefers mcdermott s card to mine .
raised lettering , pale nimbus white . . .

jean , do you feel . . . fulfilled ? i mean , in your life ?
well , i guess i do . for a long time i was too focused on my work , i think , but now i have really begun to think about changing myself , you know , developing , and . . . growing .

patrick , you re a lunatic .
come on . do not you find christie attractive ?
let s not get lewd . i am in no mood to have a lewd conversation .
come on . i think it would be a turn on .
are you telling me you have never gotten it on with a girl ?
no ! i am not a lesbian . why do you think i would be into that ?
well , you went to sarah lawrence for one thing .
did you know that whitney houstongs debut lp called simply whitney houston had four number one singles on it ? did you know that , christie ? whitney s voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile though she is mainly a jazz singer that it is hard to take in the album on a first listening .
listen , john , i have got to go . t boone pickens just walked in . . . just joking . . . no do not tip the owner of the salon . okay , john , right , got it . sorry about that .
no , i am sorry . i should have made an appointment . was that anything important ?
hi . i am donald kimball
hi . pat bateman . nice to meet you .
so , that is the topic of discussion ?
i have been hired by meredith powell to investigate the disappearance of paul owen .
you are not with the fbi or anything , are you ?
nothing like that . i am just a private investigator .
ah , i see . . . yes . paul s disappearance . . . yes .
so it is nothing that official . i just have some basic questions . about paul owen . about yourself
coffee ?
no . i am okay .
perrier ? san pellegrino ?
kimball .
mr . kimball a bottle of san pelle
oh no , i am okay .
well , that is the topic of discussion ?
the disappearance of paul owen .
oh right . well , i have not heard anything about the disappearance or anything . . . not on page six at least .
i think his family wants this kept quiet .
understandable . lime ?
no , really . i am okay .
just some preliminary questions that i need for my own files , okay ?
shoot .
how old are you ?
twenty six . i will be twenty seven in october .
where did you go to school ?
harvard . the harvard business school .
your address ?
fifty five west eighty first street . the american gardens building .
nice . very nice .
pardon me , but are you okay ?
who do you ask ?
bad habit .
would you rather i not smoke ?
no , i guess it is okay .
you sure ?
what can you tell me about paul owen ?
how well did you know him ?
i am . . . at a loss . he was part of that whole . . . yale thing , you know .
yeah . . . yale thing .
so . . . there s nothing you can tell me about paul owen ?
he led what i suppose was an orderly life . he . . . ate a balanced diet .
what kind of man was he ? besides . . . the information you have just given .
i hope i am not being cross examined here .
do you feel that way ?
no . not really .
where did paul hang out ?
hang . . . out ?
yeah . you know . . . hang out .
let me think . the newport . harry s . fluties . endochine . nell s . comell club . the new york yacht club . the regular places .
he had a yacht ?
no , he just hung out there .
do not you know this ?
anything else you can tell me about owen ?
we were both seven in .
so was i .
do you have any witnesses or fingerprints ?
well , there s a message on his answering machine saying he went to london .
well , maybe he did , huh ?
his girlfriend does not think so .
but . . . has anyone seen him in london ?
actually , yes .
hmmm .
well , i have had a hard time getting an actual verification . a stephen hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there , but i checked it out and what happened is , he mistook a hubert ainsworth for paul , so . . .
oh .
was he involved at all , do you think , in occultism or satan worship ?
what ?
i know it sounds like a lame question , but in new jersey i know this sounds like a lame question , but last month i do not know if you have heard about this , but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts
yikes ! no . paul was not into that . he followed a balanced diet and
have you consulted a psychic ?
no .
had his apartment been burglarized ?
no , it actually had not . toiletries were missing . a suit was gone . so was some luggage . that is it .
i mean no one s dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything , right ?
no , not yet . as i said , we are not sure . but . . . basically no one has seen or heard anything .
that is so typical , is not it ?
it is just strange . one day someone s walking around , going to work , alive , and then . . .
nothing .
people just . . . disappear .
the earth just opens up and swallows people .
you will have to excuse me . i have a lunch meeting with cliff huxtable at four seasons in twenty minutes .
is not the four seasons a little far uptown ? i mean are not you going to be late ?
uh , no . there s one . . . down here .
listen , if anything occurs to you , any information at all . . .
absolutely , i am with you .
detective kendall . . . uh campbell ? kimball kimball . call me don .
don .
so . . . you hang out here a lot ?
how is the investigation going ? taken anyone in for formal questioning ?
h no . informal conversations , mostly . that is that , stoli ?
yeah . no finlandia , as usual . fucking dump .
i mean they want to get caught .
i actually came to see timothy price , but he is taken a leave of absence .
yeah , gone into rehab . shame . is he a suspect ?
do you remember where you were on the night of paul s disappearance ? which was on the twentieth of december ?
i had a date with a girl named veronica .
wait . that is not what i have got .
what ?
that is not the information i have received .
well . . . i . . . wait . . . what information have you received ?
let s see . . . that you were with
well , i could he wrong .
well . . . when was the last time you were with paul owen ?
well , thank you , mr . bateman .
patrick , please . i hope i have been informative . long day a bit scattered .
listen , i am a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when i have sorted out all this information ?
great , yes , i would like that .
and if you could try and pin down where you were the night of owengs disappearance , it would make my job a lot easier .
never . i mean . . . i do not really like . . . singers .
not a big music fan , eh ?
no , i like music . just they are huey s too . . . black sounding . for me .
well , to each his own . so lunch , thursday ? i will call your secretary about reservations .
no hash browns ?
not in the mood , i guess .
but . . . everyone orders the hash browns here . i mean it is have you been here before ?
yes , of course . the hash browns are delicious . i am just . . . not . . . ordering them .
so , the night he disappeared ? any new thoughts on what you did ?
i am not really sure . i had a shower . . . and some sorbet ?
i think maybe you have got your dates mixed up .
but how ? where do you place paul that night ?
according to his date book , and this was verified by his secretary , he had dinner with . . . marcus halberstam .
and ?
i have questioned him .
marcus ?
yes . and he denies it . though at first he could not be sure .
but marcus denied it ?
yes .
well , does marcus have an alibi ?
he does ? you are sure ?
i checked it out . it is clean .
oh . kimball now where were you ?
where was marcus ?
he was not with paul owen .
so who was he with ?

i am so hungry .
why do not you get a job ? if you are so hungry , why do not you get a job ?
i lost my job . . .
gee , uh , that is too bad .
why do not you get another one ? why do not , you get another job ?
i am not . . .
you are not what ? qualified for anything else ?
i am hungry
i know that , i know that . jeez , you are like a broken record . i am trying to help you .
i am hungry .
listen , do you think it is fair to take money from people who do have jobs ? from people who do work ?
what am i gonna do ?
listen , that is your name ?
al .
speak up . come on .
al .

you re so kind , mister . you are kind . you are a kind man . i can tell .
shhhh . . . it is okay .
please . . . i don know what to do . i am so cold .

i cannot . . . i cannot find a shelter
hello , halberstam . nice tie . how the hell are you ?
how is the ransom account going , marcus ?
it is . . . it is . . . all right .
really ? that is interesting . not great ?
oh well , you know .
and how is cecilia ? she is a great girl .
listen , the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here .
yeah , well , you are late .
hey , i am a child of divorce . give me a break hmmm , i see they have omitted the pork loin with lime jello .
we should have gone to dorsia . i could have gotten us a table .
so , was not rothschild originally handling the fisher account ? how did you get it ?
and cecelia , how is she ? where is she tonight ?
cecelia is , well . . . you know
evelyn . great ass . goes out with that loser patrick bateman . what a dork .
paul , give me your amex card . good boy . bateman slaps the card down , looks at the check .
two hundred and fifty . very reasonable . let s leave a big tip , shall we ? my place hr a nightcap ?
no , man . i am gonna bail .
you like huey lewis and the news ?
hey , halberstam ?
yes , owen ?
why are there copies of the style section all over the place ? do you have a dog ? a chow or something ?
no , owen .
is that a raincoat ?
you think so ?
you will look like you consciously worked for the look .
how can he lie like that ? how can he pull that shit ?
what shit ? now where do we have reservations at ? i mean i am not really hungry , but i would like to have reservations somewhere .
i just do not see how someone , anyone , can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit . how can you be so fucking , i do not know , cool about it ?
is it over ?
they still have to give em refreshments laced with mind altering drugs .
you are a fanatic .
alice ? you gotta make him do the start up with teddy and me .
make him ?
i am just screwed .
you know what he is like . he just wants to work on stuff that is cool .
you do not wanna move , do you ?
i cannot help it . i feel like they would do anything to keep their
i think i kind of lost it . i was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest , most powerful . . . wouldid not know i even cared about that stuff .
a lot of what larry says is true . they just clone stuff , or reverse engineer it , and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they
it is important .
if he is really a bully , he will not cop to it , anyway .
when i was a kid ? and he was moving us all over the place ? i spent all my time writing stuff on outpost . . i thought gary boyd was the greatest .
if my dad would leveled with me like that even once . . . the weird thing is , my fantasy he could somehow be like the old gary ? it is his fantasy , too .
i think that is great , milo . i do .
. . . but ?
did not you visit the campus ?
i forgot . that is why you have to help me decide .
no way . you have this destiny .
c mon , i would not have a destiny without you . my destiny would be dying at . from eating
do not bring that up . like a different girlfriend would would have let you die ?
whengs brian coming for the tv ?
that took some fun out of
you know he is never been anybody s counselor before ?
to our new life . . . . that is wrong ?
that is what i need to ask you . you know you cannot keep anything from me .
it is the way he said it . just the way my dad did , when he was caught in a lie . that is how you knew you were onto something ugly .
what would it mean , anyway ? if he did not write it ?
he is your boss . he is not your
i know , i know .
if you cannot deal with him on that basis , you better get a new counselor .
is not that extreme ?
i mean , if one little comment from gary is gonna upset you this much
what !
teddy was killed last night .
what are you what ?
are you saying you think they had something to do with his death ? nelson said it was an airtight case .
i do not know what i am saying . maybe maybe they hired those guys .
i cannot see outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that .
i do not know ! i just know it was teddy s code . all these ideas flying in from everywhere . you know how he says any kid working in his garage can put us out of business ? it is like they know what every kid s doing .
they hack into people s programs ?
it is not a broadcast studio . it is a surveillance post or something . that is why they have the dishes on top .
you are scaring me . i think we should just go .
go where ? you cannot get away from people like this .
like this ? it is gary you are talking about .
you think i do not know that ?
milo . why would he
how should i know ? solving a problem , i guess . or needing to control everything . i do not know . i have gotta get in there .
even if all this were true . there are other buildings . all of them filled with computers and
it is the only one with dishes on the roof . the studio s a front . that is why they keep postponing its opening . . . . gotta get in there .
milo , you told me those doj agents are all over the place . how could they hope to hide a surveillance post ? and how can you get in there , anyway ? with the cameras and the swipe cards
i cannot just walk away !
you cannot just walk in , either .
they stop the construction work at six or seven . the parking lot s mostly clear by two or three in the morning . even the early geeks do not get there before five .
i know how to get in there . but you have gotta help me .
. . . whaddo i do ?
it is almost nine , i have been so worried ! what did you see in there ?
nothing .
it is what they said it is . an unfinished broadcast studio . you were right . . . i just drove to seattle and back .
. . . why ?
the justice department guy who came to the apartment when
i remember .
after i broke into which was insane , thank god they did not catch me ! i just drove around . trying to figure out what possessed me . you know what ? i have been putting my own guilt on gary .
guilt ?
if i would stayed down there , maybe this would not have happened .
that was different .
where were you ? you know you cannot keep anything from me .
look at this .
what ?
why does not he ask us to his party . he is never even met you .
he has thousands of employees , milo
it is for the museum . he knows you are a painter . if anybody should be invited
milo
i know you think i am too attached to him , but still . i am close to gary . and you are the most meaningful person in my life . i am going back to the comix place , why should i be killing myself .
are you gonna tell me where you went ?
no . no . i sent an e mail to somebody , just now . to tell her how i feel about you . you know i am clueless , without you . you know i
great !
you look beautiful .
yeah ? give me a goodbye kiss .
. . . what ?
milo ?
do not we have any chopsticks ?
here we go .
. . . wanna savor this .
it is gonna get cold .
right . wait . a toast .
wouldid not mention he was going to the justice department ?
no .
not like him , is it ? to do a thing like that without telling you . you are not losing your hold on him , are you ?
he will tell me when he gets home .
that will be a test , will not it ?
instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl . fire her . or something .
lisa s an extremely valuable member of the skywire team . we have got our eyes on her . you keep yours on milo .
he said it made sense that gary s code was like teddy s , that that clich about great minds was true . said it was all about his own guilt . plus , he has a tendency to get gary mixed up with his dad once in a while . it always passes .
he was not acting ?
do not worry , milo . i am here as a friend . or maybe a supplicant .
right . . . that is that mean again ?
beggar . we are at a disadvantage with outpost . our experts are not as smart as theirs . sometimes we cannot tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly . we need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights . i am taking a shot in the dark , here . i can offer you , a year , a buick . i am hoping you have got a feeling it is the right thing to do .
it is just i kind of feel the need to do something with my ability . create something . . .
mr . barton , do you remember me ?
. . . it is milo , is not it ?
yes sir . i need to talk to you .
milo ?
yeah . hi . thank you for seeing me .
what seems to be the problem ? you look a little upset .
milo ?
my friend , my best friend , teddy , was killed in silicon valley .
my goodness .
it was racially motivated . he is chinese . he was . and . . . i know sometimes the fbi gets involved with that . do not they ?
if there s a civil rights violation . but generally we let the local police and da do their work first .
i just wanna help bring these guys to justice . they are neo nazis .
let me look into it , see that is being done . frankly , it is not my area .
just did not know who else to talk to .
and outpost ? you are happy there ?
you are living here ?
thought if i relocated it could help my case . i am writing programs for the local public access station . where any whack job with bucks gets his own show ? god , does it suck . can you help me ?
well i parked illegally . see y later ?
this is the biggest beta demo in like the history of software . you would be my partner .
you cannot pre empt yoga , that is our biggest show .
will i get to work for outpost ?
no . but you can write your own ticket in the valley after this . we are gonna bring down outpost .
what ?
okay .
great . great ! we need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door
what ? !
you are interfaced with our dish .
is it your software ?
what ? !
. . . when did you know ?
that is gotta kill him , right ?
outpost was his baby , sure . on the other hand , we just learned gary boyd owns the skywire satellites . personally .
conglomerates are lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites . they will pay him a huge premium to get on line .
that would change with a criminal indictment .
there s no hard evidence he knew about this . anybody who could implicate him seems to have vanished .
is not there a stigma ? bankrolling this guy ?
stigma ? larry ! billion buys you some slack in this world .
and the kid who wrote skywire then gave it away ? they are calling him the digital robin hood .
milo . surprised he is not your guest .
we tried !
milo ? i am danny .
could not convince teddy to come ?
he is pretty tight with his family .
we could move em up here .
who s that ?
. . . hello ?
milo ? gary boyd . i am hoping you and your friend can come up here . we have made some amazing strides in digital convergence . i would love to show them to you .
cool !
would you like a coke or something ?
you know a lot about art , i guess .
i have only shown this to three other people . i bought , we have launched so far . i keep the coordinates in this room . it is left over from sdi . reagangs star wars technology ? they orbit miles up .
low enough to relay internet traffic .
among other things . . . we know convergence is the real super highway all the pc s , tv s , phones , etc . linked together . why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky ?
the content filer has t be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms . really , omniplatforms . including whatever new hardware emerges .
it needs a more object oriented language . this does not scale , does it ?
when you get to a certain age , you start wondering . about your legacy . i doubt you even remember outpost .
i do !
no ! just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself .
think i should buy some originals ?
. . . do i ?
somebody said i am just another philistine . with reproductions .
that is insane . you are ahead of your time .
could work with a new switch . there may be a few more things hidden .
how is it going ?
maybe i am going too fast .
it is okay . really .
you did this overnight ?
milo . that is up ?
well you sent for me .
you really wrote this just today ?
what are you implying .
everything i do is under scrutiny . the questions they ask , trying to make anything strategic look sordid . i am confused . does not everybody in business try to get ahead ?
i am sure .
it scales , do not you think ?
i heard what happened .
had you talked to him much lately ?
just once . guess i was worried we did not have anything to talk about , since work was off limits . non disclosure .
did you ?
talk about work ? never !
i meant did you find other stuff to
oh . yeah .
you have been coming in early .
wow . you must have , lines of code there . . .
been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler . and it came over me it is in the wrong place .
the wrong place ?
gary , hi .
you look a little tired .
i am okay . it is going well !
have a look ?
why did you move around so much ? when you were a kid .
. . . my dad was a compulsive gambler . only he did not think he was . that applied to guys who did not have a system . losers , who played games of chance . he could read people , so chance had nothing to do with it . no matter how deep a hole he dug himself , he would give you the whole speech . and you would better not point out the obvious . his creditors would catch up to him . loan sharks or whatever . he would wake us in the middle of the night . off we would go , again .
no . i just went deeper into the machine . preferred being the geek to having to explain . lying would have been worse .
. . . worse ?
cause he was a liar . and i hated him . get your head out of that machine , wise up to the real world . the more he mocked me the deeper i went . cause if being savvy meant being like him guess that is why i am kind of clueless , even now . did not cultivate my conniving side . not sure i even have one .
that is great ! thanks .
dear lisa . i have enjoyed working with you . i would be lying if i did not say i find you attractive . but in my heart i know that alice . . . you left my party to send e mail ?
you could have handwritten it .
i am not much good at handwriting . or parties .
gary , i
i hope you know what you mean to me . not just because of what you are doing . because of who you are .
i am pretty close . but when i wrote the last contact switches , it wiped out a piece of the content filer . you know what it is like , writing software .
this is good . who did it ?
start up not miles from here . kid s on prozac .
what would the girl say ?
has not affected his work , though .
help me change the skywire settings . add five degrees to each satellite coordinate .
gary , do not worry , we
okay , .
ready for number three ?
let s go .
longitude
wait . . . he knows .
what ?
knows i am altering the coordinates . let s jump to .
gary ?
all the companies know . the faculties tell em . at the target schools .
i think you should go .
you do ?
i know you lost all his work . maybe i could come down here and
you are naive . look at your employment contract you cannot work anywhere else in this field for at least few years . not that i do not miss you .
just thought his work should go on .
he was on the verge of something , too . he was gonna show us the next day . he said the answer s not in the box , it is in the band . know what it means ?
it is only meaningful when you have got , lines of code to back it up .
man , could he write code . totally elegant . he had his own style .
your app kind of blew mine out of the water .
we will come up with the next big thing .
. . . you wanna work here ?
you guys will be using teddy s old space , is that okay ?
could it be a glitch ? something the construction workers caused ?
unlikely . all cameras are frozen . do we call randy and phil ? tell em there may have been a break in ?
every entry was authorized .
keep looking .
what are we looking for ?
delbert seems to enter twice . without leaving the first time .
get the backslash , the colon , keys kids do not use but geeks do . what would milo want in here , anyway ?
you calling phil and randy ?
come with me .
now what are we doing ? i do not get any of this shit !
lisa .
you know my name .
you know mine .
you are famous around here .
i am getting a teacher s pet rep .
i would not worry about it . you have gotta figure most people around here were their teachers pets .
. . . were you ?
we moved around so much i barely knew my teachers .
me too ! were you an army brat or something ?
. . . something like that . yeah .
did i say something ?
what have you got there ?
graphical interfaces . for skywire ? i am s posed to coordinate with you .
cool !
did you wanna be alone ?
they just pushed up the schedule on skywire apps . how fast are you going ?
there is no second place . plus every time i get jammed up , gary has an inspiration . is it like that with your counselor ?
mine s not the ceo . he barely remembers to take a shower .
right , right . but does he ever just , like , hand you code ?
maybe once . i re wrote it , anyway .
you are compulsive .
mmm more like i have a little trouble . trusting people .
why s that ?
so , when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers . was that then ? or now ?
that is great . i did not know .
i snuck into .
why would you do a thing like
you thought about it too . you have been suspicious for a while . but it is not happening in there . it is happening in the day care .
it is easy to know who the smart geeks are , the schools tell em . they upload medical files , school records , pharmacy files . they would be happy just to steal code forever . but when a program gets close to fruition . like teddy . he was almost there .
but why would they ?
i know why you are so secretive . why you will not let anybody near you . i know what he did to you .
is that my scenario ? tell me .
they would frame him .
he is out of prison ?
. . . milo ?
hmm ?
i always felt if a boy i liked ever found out he would run . he would think i was unclean .
what about the fbi ?
they have got this guy in the doj , maybe others . we tell the wrong person , it is over .
who can we trust ?
do we post it on the net ?
the mainstream media . tv , or a newsmagazine .
right . but gary s tied in to a lot of media conglomerates . have to be careful who we pick .
we could cross reference a data base on media ownership . but not on our own computers . not even at home .
he is buying up pretty much everything cable companies , baby bells , picture libraries , museum rights , film archives . . . getting ready for skywire .
what about minutes .
yeah , they dig stuff like this . cbs news has partnered with outpost information systems in a cable news network due to launch fall of .
but still , you cannot say cbs would not love to break something like
time ?
how close are you ?
what ?
we cannot just assume they are standing by to receive skywire months from launch . i would have to write in an aglet .
a what ?
it is how on line services push logos they wanna sell you . you do not ask for em , they just appear . have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house . and then the quality of the broadcast would not exactly be digital , that is months away .
but they would still get the idea , right ?
you would have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop . maybe some audio , too . to tie it all in to gary . how long would that take you ?
it is a standard gui . once i have got a concept , it is maybe three day s work .
gary knows i am close on skywire . we have to do this fast .
before they kill somebody else , too .
oh , man . i would have to get into gary s house . to get the satellite positions .
you mean break in ?
i do not know
why were you so careless ?
why were you snooping in my office ?
think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are ?
i told teddy about you .
what would he say ?
i felt guilty . cause i owed so much to alice . but even then i was starting to wonder . is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you ? if you have a lucrative skill , it is all anybody wants from you . you grow older but you do not grow up . you turn into into
great . i knocked off the aglet , as soon as i get a passable version of skywire we are there .
the dishes are juiced up , too .
thank god .
milo ? shrot suspects somebody broke into . i was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts .
they know i broke in . alice helped me . shrot s not one of them . he is blundering into this on his own .
he does not know about the day care .
hardly anybody does , that is the beauty part . no cameras , the doj does not bother with it , it is accessed by a tunnel they boast about . you know the best place to hide a leaf ?
yeah , that is old , in a tree .
oh .
same with the excerpts i am choosing they will play against any of the images you described .
perfect . how am i gonna get away from the party long enough to
you could always say you have to go the bathroom .
that is lame , is not it ?
does he know you know ?
he suspects i know something . i think he was sort of explaining himself to me , in case i do . we have to go in tonight . i am two hours from a beta version . but i have gotta go home for an hour .
why ? !
she called to apologize . i said i was pulling an all nighter . she said then come home just to say hi . which i always do when we fight , it is suspicious if i do not .
please do not go .
meet me at the other location .
they know , i had no choice . get out of the house now ! do you have a laptop ?
it is three years old , it
bring it to the other location .
maybe it is the satellite .
. . . he knows .
what ?
latitude degrees .
. . . you got my e mail ?
and your phone messages . you wanna do what you do , it is not a crime .
is that how larry feels ?
wanted to say goodbye to him . . .
we rented a loft in sunnyvale . you know that is the bad part ? we cannot talk about work anymore . we are competitors ! the venture capitalists made us sign like confidentiality forms .
but these , like , white supremacists trashed my office , last week .
they are in the neighborhood . they usually hassle vietnamese grocers .
jesus , teddy .
i am cool . they did not touch the machine . or my disks . probably did not know what they were . so , you a moonie yet ? milo ?
i met this girl .
what ? come on . is it serious ?
i do not know .
did you tell alice ?
no ! i keep thinking it will go away . but there s this connection . she is been hacking since she was little , she had to move around a lot . plus i see her every day , we are working on the same program . she is beautiful .
a beautiful geek ? i do not wanna sound paranoid , or like a pig , but what are the chances ?
what d you mean ?
i dunno . i guess larry s got me totally suspicious of that place .
what does that mean ?
milo , geeks do not have two girlfriends . most do not have one .
so how far are we from the campus ?
so how would you like the house ?
his snapples were in alphabetical order .
every geek here s got a thing for lisa . but that is about the biggest reaction she is had to anybody .
she is a programmer ?
heavy graphical background , doing design interface for skywire apps . you will be working with her .
i have got a girlfriend , remember ?
what are they building ?
. way behind schedule . it is top secret , but everybody knows it is a digital broadcast space . they see the dishes on top , the fiber optics going in .
gary s not into fiber optics . he is betting everything on the satellites .
we tried the big vaporware number , gary , it is no sale .
can we buy into their ipo ? or is that a justice dept . problem ?
maybe he will get back to work .
speaking of which . . .
did you download corey ? in san jose ?
damn . have to go back over there . be so much easier if we could walk in the front door .
what is it ?
not much . glorified cherry bomb . right by the civil defense sign ? some geek s idea of irony . i been saying we need a camera in this hall .
there s nothing in this hall . someone s pulling your chain , as usual .
that kid s the great white hope .
i could get it out of him .
who are these guys ?
where is he ?
fellas , i am gonna have to ask you to leave here now .
wait a second . i am the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place .
you seem surprised to see me .
i thought you would quit while you were ahead .
what , and watch all my earnings go . . . down the toilet ?
what do you want , mr . . . cunningham , was it ?
call me ritchie , miss fagina . may i call you alotta . . . please ?
you may .
your boss , number two , i understand that cat s involved in big underground drills .
virtucongs main interest is in cable television , but they do have a subterranean construction division , yes . how did you know ?
i did not , baby , you just told me .
it is for the mining industry , mr . cunningham . we can talk about business later . but first , let me slip into something more comfortable .
come in .
i would rather talk about number two .
may i wash you ?
in japan , men come first and women come second .
or sometimes not at all .
care for some saki ?
how do you feel , mr . cunningham ?
pardon me for being rude , it was not me , it was my food . it just popped up to say hello , and now it is gone back down below .
that is very clever . do you know any other poems ?
milk , milk , lemonade . round the corner fudge is made . stick your finger in the hole , and out comes a tootsie roll !
thank you , that is beautiful . to your health .
to my health .
do you mind if i ask you a personal question ?
is it about my teeth ?
yes .
damn . what exactly do you do at virtucon ?
i will tell you all in due time , after we make love . but first , tell me another poem .
i think it was wordsworth who penned this little gem press the button , pull the chain , out comes a chocolate choo choo train .
austin powers ? hi , i am andy warhol .
hey , how are you ?
hungry .
i am going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it .
if you can become famous , everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame , man .
fifteen minutes of fame ? i am going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that , either .
hello , austin . this is basil exposition , chief of british intelligence . you are austin powers , international man of mystery , and you are with agent mrs . kensington . the year is , and you are talking on a picture phone .
we know all that , exposition .
i just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows that is going on at any given time . we have just received word that dr . evil , the ultimate square , is planning to take over the world .
dr . evil ? i thought i put him in jail for good .
just where you would never think to look for him . we will be there .
good luck , austin .
thank you .
oh , and austin . . .
yes ?
be careful .
where am i ?
you are in the ministry of defense . it is . you have been cryogenically frozen for thirty years .
who are these people ?
the shouting is a temporary side effect of the unfreezing process .
yes , i am having trouble controlling . . . the volume of my voice !
you might also experience a slight fever , dry mouth , and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation . austin , this is commander gilmour , strategic command , and general borschevsky , russian intelligence .
russian intelligence ? are you mad ?
a lot s happened since you were frozen , austin . the cold war s over .
thank god . those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people , hey comrades ?
we won , austin .
when do i begin ?
immediately . you will be working with ms . kensington .
you mean mrs . kensington ?
vanessa s one of our top agents .
yes , well . . . agent kensington will get you set up . she is very dedicated . perhaps , a little too dedicated . she is got a bit of a bug up her ass . good luck , austin , the world s depending on you .
thank you , exposition .
oh , and austin . . .
yes ?
be careful .
hello austin . hello vanessa . this is basil exposition , from british intelligence . there s a company in las vegas called virtucon that we think may be linked to dr . evil . many of the virtucon executives gamble at the hotel casino where you will be staying . that is the first place you should look . well , i am off to the chat rooms .
thank you , exposition .
oh , and austin . . .
yes ?
hello , austin , this is basil exposition from british intelligence . thank you for confirming the link between dr . evil and virtucon . find out what part virtucon plays in something called project vulcan . i will need you and vanessa to get on that immediately .
right away , exposition .
she is working on another lead right now .
then you will have to go it alone . good luck .
thank you , basil .
oh , and austin . . .
yes ?
let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation .
oh , yes . thank you .
there s one more thing , austin .
yes ?
be careful .
hello , exposition .
austin , vanessa , let me bring you up to speed . dr . evil has high jacked a nuclear warhead from kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one hundred billion dollars . if the world does not pay up in four days , he is threatening to destroy the world .
thank you , exposition . only two things , scare me , and one is nuclear war .
that is the other ?
excuse me ?
that is the other thing you are scared of ?
carnies .
what ?
circus folk . nomads , you know . they smell like cabbage .
indeed . . . if we could get back to the business at hand . it is one thing to have a warhead , it is quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it .
maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle . i have uncovered the details on project vulcan . it is a new subterranean warhead delivery system .
my god , austin , what have you done ?
i am sorry , basil , i thought she was a man .
damn it , man ! you are talking about my mother !
all right , austin , i think you should go .
i think if everyone were honest , they would confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag .
i am leaving ! oh , and austin ?
yes , basil ?
be careful .
well , austin , you have stopped dr . evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe , and somehow you and agent kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair .
i would say that about sums it up , exposition .
congratulations , field agent kensington !
here s the number of my dentist , he is first rate . ring him up , he will look after you .
but , wait , i you got me again . oh , and austin
yes basil ?
hey austin powers , it is me , mick jagger .
hey , mick !
are you more satisfied now sexually , austin ?
well , you cannot always get what you want .
you cannot always get what you want ! that is a great title for a song ! i am gonna write that , and it will be a big hit .
good on ya , man .
good afternoon , mr . powers , i am the destructacon . i am programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point . you might as well surrender . resistance is futile . your odds of survival are , , to . . .
well , destructacon , you have quite a head on your shoulders , i dare to coin .
yes , i am programmed to answer any question .
really ? let me ask you this . what is love ?
that does not compute .
why not ? it is a question .
that is wrong with your hand ?
i am sorry , baby , i am just not grocking your head space .
dr . evil , do you really expect them to pay ?
i have got you , dr . evil !
well done , mr . powers . we are not so different , you and i . it is true , you are british , and i am belgian . you have a full head of hair , mine is slightly receding . you are thin , i am about forty pounds overweight . ok , we are different , i am not making a very good point . however , is not it ironic , mr . powers , that the very things you stand for swinging , free love , parties , distrust of authority are all now , in the nineties , considered to be . . . evil ? maybe we have more in common than you care to admit .
no , man , what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you , whose bag was money and world domination . we were innocent , man . if we would known the consequences of our sexual liberation , we would have done things differently , but the spirit would have remained the same . it is freedom , man .
your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan i ever dreamed of . face it , freedom failed .
that is why right now is a very groovy time , man . we still have freedom , but we also have responsibility .
it seems the tables have turned again , dr . evil .
not really . kill the little bastard . see what i care .
mr . powers , my job is to acclimate you to the nineties . you know , a lot s changed since .
well , as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection , while at the same time experimenting with mind expanding drugs in a consequence free environment , i will be sound as a pound .
my mother s told me all about you .
if it is a lie , goddamn her . it it is the truth , goddamn me . god , i hope that is witty . how is your mum ?
ok , ok , man , do not get heavy , i will sign . just to get things moving , baby .
listen , mr . powers , i look forward to working with you , but do me a favor and stop calling me baby . you can address me as agent kensington . we have to leave immediately . we have preserved your private jet just as you left it . it is waiting at heathrow airport .
pretty groovy jumbo jet , eh ? how does a hot chick like you end up working at the ministry of defense ?
i went to oxford and excelled in several subjects , but i ended up specializing in foreign languages . i wanted to travel see the world . in my last year i was accepted into the m . o . d . in the cultural studies sector . i thought i was off on an exciting career , but my job was to read everything printed in every country . it is very boring . my whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in farsi . if i do well with this case , i finally get promoted to field operative . . .
that is fascinating , vanessa . listen , why do not we go into the back and shag ?
i beg your pardon ?
i have been frozen for thirty years , man , i want to see if my bits and pieces are still working .
excuse me ?
my wedding tackle .
i am sorry ?
my meat and two veg .
mr . powers , please . i know that you must be a little confused , but we have a very serious situation at hand . i would appreciate it if you would concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest .
have you ever made love to a chigro ?
a chigro ?
you know , a chigro . . . part chinese , part negro . . . chigro .
we do not use the term negro anymore . it is considered offensive .
brrrr ! she must be frigid . there s two things i know about life one , americans will never take to soccer . two , swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag ! they are shag mad , man ! let me ask you a question , vanessa , and be honest .
sure .
do i make you horny ?
what ?
do i make you horny ? randy , you know . to you , am i eros manifest ?
i hope this is part of the unfreezing process .
listen , vanessa , i am a swinger . . . that is what i do , i swing .
you have preserved my jag ! smashing !
let me guess . the floss is garotte wire , the toothpaste contains plastic explosives , and the toothbrush is the detonation device .
no , actually . i do not know how to put this really . well , there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry .
hey , who put this in here ? someone s playing a prank on me ! honestly , this is not mine .
i am sure .
i love las vegas , man . oh , i forgot my x ray glasses .
here , use mine .
i cannot see a bloody thing .
why did you leave so soon ?
good morning , luv , who are you on the phone with ?
good morning , vanessa ! i hope you have on clean underwear .
why ?
a limousine has just pulled up .
hello , hello . that is dr . evil s cat .
how do you know ?
let s go get him !
he is too well protected right now .
we cannot just sit here , austin .
let me tell you a story . there s these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below . the young bull says , hey , why do not we run down the hill and shag us a cow ? , and the wise old bull replies , no , why do not we walk down the hill and shag all the cows ?
i do not get it .
well , you know . . . cows , and shagging .
unfortunately , while you told that stupid story , dr . evil has escaped .
i hate having my picture taken .
fancy a nibble ?
watch out , you are on my hair !
sorry . move your hand to the left . there you go . gorgeous .
i have not had fun like that since college .
i am sorry .
why ?
always wanting to have fun , that is you in a nutshell .
you are smashed , vanessa .
i am not .
oh , yes you are .
i cannot . you are drunk .
it is not that i am drunk , i am just beginning to see what my mum was talking about . what was my mother like back in the sixties ? i am dying to know .
really , austin !
austin , may i have a word with you ?
of course , luv .
listen , i know i am just being neurotic , but i cannot shake this suspicious feeling about that italian secretary , ms . fagina . i mean , i do not want to sound paranoid , but i have had some bad relationships in the past , and i have some jealousy issues . you went to her penthouse . it makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities , but i cannot help but feel this weird , irrational , unfocused . . . well , jealousy . i am sorry .
do not be sorry . you are right to be suspicious . i shagged her . i shagged her rotten .
i cannot believe you made love to her just like that . did you use protection ?
of course , i had my nine millimeter automatic .
no , did you use a condom ?
only sailors use condoms , man .
not in the nineties .
well they should , filthy beggars , they go from port to port . alotta meant nothing to me .
well , it means something to me . if you want us to have a relationship , you have got to be a one woman man .
it was just a shag , vanessa . you are everything to me .
hello , luv .
thirty years of political and social upheaval . the fall of the berlin wall , a female prime minister of england , the abolishment of apartheid , a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang .
yeah , i cannot believe liberace was gay . women loved him , man . i did not see that one coming .
basil was very concerned to know where you were last night .
out and about , doing odds and sods .
since i have been unfrozen , i have had a rancid taste in my mouth . do you have a piece of gum ?
do you think she is prettier than i ?
who ?
you know who .
no ! do not lay your hang ups on me , vanessa . you are being very trippy .
austin , we do not look anything like our photo badges .
thank god , austin , we made it .
does that make you horny ?
first , i plan to soil myself . then , i plan to regroup and think about the next move . any thoughts ?
all right , i get it . i have bad teeth . you have to understand , in britain in the sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth . it did not matter .
no , no , no . we will use the floss to get to the ledge .
not a good time to lose one s head .
indeed .
that is not the way to get ahead in life .
yes .
it is a shame he was not more headstrong .
shut up .
what do we do now ?
we have got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag . you go get help . i am gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad doctor .
i am not going anywhere . we are a team .
too right , youth . that is why i need you to lead the troops .
i will hurry back .
listen , vanessa , whatever happens , i just want you to know that i feel bad about shagging that italian girl . i had a sip of sake and all of the sudden , i do not know what happened . the whole time i was shagging her i mean really shagging her , i mean it was crazy , i was like a huge mechanical piston , in and out , in and out !
austin , that is your point ?
anyways , what i am trying to say is that if you want me to be a one woman man , well , that is just groovy , because . . . i love you .
it is not what it looks like , vanessa . at ease , boys .
likewise .
i can explain . they attacked me . gas came out of her . . . well , and then they . . . and i . . .
i believe you , austin . let s go .
follow me ! we are going to have to jump over the rail !
are you crazy ?
austin , i am coming with you .
i am going it alone this time , vanessa . i have a follow up visit with the evil doctor .
i have something to tell you .
lay it on me .
i love you , austin .
that is fab , because i love you , too , vanessa .
kiss me .
danger powers , personal effects .
actually , my name s austin powers .
it says here , name danger powers .
danger s my middle name .
ok , austin danger powers one blue crushed velvet suit . one frilly lace cravat . one gold medallion with peace symbol . one pair of italian shoes . one pair of tie dyed socks , purple . one vinyl recording album tom jones , live at las vegas . one swedish made penis enlarger pump .
that is not mine .
one credit card receipt for swedish made penis enlarger pump , signed austin powers .
i am telling you , baby , that is not mine .
one warranty card for swedish made penis enlarger pump , filled out by austin powers .
i do not even know what this is . this sort of thing ai not my bag , baby .
hi , folks . you are entering a restricted zone . can i see your security badges ?
everything seems to be in order .
here , have a piece of gum .
do not mind if i do .
no , no , i want you to have it , even if it is my last piece .
no , no , i want you to have it , even if it is my last piece .
noooooooooooooo !
commander , this is slater in sowest com three . we have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle .
is it one of ours ?
no . log com bird twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy , not stealthy , not carbon composite . it does have an odd shape , sir .
what are you saying , son ?
oh my god , he is back .
in many ways , bob s big boy never left , sir . he is always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices .
shut up .
should we scramble tachq for an intercept ?
commander , i have to log it . . .
but my design was perfect ! your autonomic functions were shut down , and even though your arm was not frozen , the aging was retarded , therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left .
but dr . evil , all you need to do is work with this tennis ball . squeeze it for twenty minutes a day . a few months of that and it will be just as strong as the other arm . . .
we could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process emdash
ahhhhhhhhh !
we have got a lot of work to do .
someone help me ! i am still alive , only i am very badly burned .
some of you i know , some of you i am meeting for the first time .
hello up there ! anyone ! can someone call an ambulance ? i am in quite a lot of pain .
ow ! you shot me !
right . okay . moving on .
remember when we froze your semen , you said that if it looked like you were not coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever ?
yes .
well , after a few years , we got sort of impatient . dr . evil , i want you to meet your son .
my son ?
austin powers is getting too close . he must be neutralized . any suggestions ?
breathtaking , frau . these automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate powers .
quite impressive .
thank you , herr doctor .
release the sharks ! all the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads . i figure every creature deserves a warm meal .
dr . evil ?
yes , what is it ? you are interrupting my moment of triumph .
it is about the sharks . since you were frozen , they have been placed on the endangered species list . we tried to get some , but it will take months to clear up the red tape .
what is it now ?
well , we experimented with lasers , but you would be surprised at how heavy they are . they actually outweighed the piranha themselves , and the fish , well , they sank to the bottom and died .
i have one simple request sharks with frigging laser beams attached to their heads , and it cannot be done ? remind me again why i pay you people ? what do we have ?
sea bass .
right .
they are mutated sea bass .
really ? are they ill tempered ?
that was great , mr . keon , dave . thank you . ok , group , we have two new member . say hello to scott and his father , mr . . . . ehville ?
no , the boy s right . i really am evil .
actually , the boy s quite astute . i am trying to kill him . my evil associates have cautioned against it , so here he is , unfortunately , alive .
we have heard from scott , now let s hear from you .
the details of my life are quite inconsequential .
hi .
hello , scott . i am your father , dr . evil . i have a son ! i have a son ! everyone , i have a son ! someday , scott , this will all be yours .
but scott , who s going to take over the world when i die ?
an evil vet ?
no . maybe , like , work in a petting zoo or something .
an evil petting zoo ?
scott my boy , come here . how was your day ?
well , me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and , like , they do not speak english right , and so my buddy gets into a fight , and he goes hey , quit hassling me cause i do not speak french or whatever , and the other guy goes something in paris talk , and i go um , just back off and he goes get out and i go make me .
fascinating . what are your plans for this evening ?
thought i would stay in . there s a good tittie movie on skinemax .
and that is how you want to live your life , is it ?
scott , i want you to meet daddy s nemesis , austin powers .
why are you feeding him ? why do not you just kill him ?
in due time .
but what if he escapes ? why do not you just shoot him ? what are you waiting for ?
i have a better idea . i am going to put him in an easily escapable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death .
why do not you just shoot him now ? here , i will get a gun . we will just shoot him . bang ! dead . done .
fine . whatever . mutated , ill tempered sea bass it is . come , let s return to dinner . close the tank .
are not you going to watch them ? they will get away !
no , we will leave them alone and not actually witness them dying , and we will just assume it all went to plan .
i have a gun in my room . give me five seconds , i will come back and blow their brains out .
come , everyone , let us repair to the main chamber . project vulcan is about to begin . scott , are you coming ?
i do not want to .
do not you want to see what daddy does for a living ?
blow me .
what did you say ?
dad , we just made a breakthrough in group !
i had the group liquidated , you little shit . they were insolent .
i hate you ! i hate you ! i wish i was never artificially created in a lab .
we also own the franklin mint , which makes decorative hand painted theme plates for collectors . some plates , like the gone with the wind series , have gone up in value as much as two hundred and forty percent , but , as with any investment , there is some risk involved .
um , dr . evil , prince charles did have an affair . he admitted it , and they are now divorced , actually .
umm , that also has already happened .
do not you think we should ask for more than a million dollars ? a million dollars is not that much money these days .
virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year .
oh , hello vanessa . how was the flight ?
great .
how is austin ?
he is asleep .
you did not . . .
i am proud of you .
why ?
well , god knows he tried , but i have been rather firm with him , mummy . you did not tell me he was so obsessed with sex . it is bizarre .
you cannot judge him by modern standards . he is very much a product of his times . in my day he could have any woman he wanted .
what about his teeth ?
you have to understand , in britain in the sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth . it did not matter .
i just do not see it .
just wait . once austin gets you in his charms , it is impossible to get out .
did you ever . . .
of course not . i was married to your father .
did you ever want to ?
you did not answer my question , mum .
no , it is been too long . best to leave things alone .
i am on with a friend ! look , i would better go . i love you .
so , scott , why do not we start with you . why are you here ?
well , it is kind of weird .
we do not judge here .
ok . well , i just really met my dad for the first time three days ago . he was partially frozen for thirty years . i never knew him growing up . he comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business .
and how do you feel about that ?
what do you want to do , scott ?
we do not label people here , scott .
no , he is really evil .
i just think , like , he hates me . i really think he wants to kill me .
we are not yet open for business , i am afraid .
shame . i was recommended . by a friend .
really ?
sir august merryweather ? i was looking for something relaxing . say , a tuscan hillside in june ?
normally , we would be eager to oblige
seriously ?
of course . natural weather delivered to your door on demand . down your phoneline . for limited periods .
you do not say . how real does it feel ?
as real as you wish . hot or cold . humid or dry . anything you like . within reason .
there are limits ?
the technology is brand new . soon it will be more powerful . we anticipate a huge demand . leave us your number . we will be in touch .
i want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when i say these words . do you understand . . . ? blue . . .
. . . bottle . . .
red . . .
knight . . .
black . . .
. . . death . . .
love . . .
flower . . .
nature . . .
. . . preserve . . .
secret . . .
. . . love . . .
hope . . .
. . . love . . .
fear . . .
. . . love . . .
how long have i been here ?
he said if it vanished , he would know it was . . . you who betrayed him . he took a huge risk . the ultimate test .
would that i could say the same .
i have come to apply for membership in brolly
i so agree . how did you acquire a taste for it ?
you
have we met ?
ah , beautiful . just as he promised .
promised ? who promised ?
mrs . peel . . . come quickly . brolly s been betrayed ! i will tell you everything . . . the weather s getting worse and worse . . . they are after me . . . coming for me . . . come quickly !
may i help you , madam . . .
mr . john steed , please .
i am afraid that is impossible .
you are female ?
as you see .
then you cannot come in .
i have an appointment .
no women . not in boodles . not since .
sir august . . . ? sir august . . . ?
quite a collection .
your voice it is so familiar . . .
congratulations , mrs . peel . you have been a worthy opponent . you have tracked us down . you are within an ace of winning .
this is not a game .
quite right , but we still make the rules .
rules are made to be broken .
people , too .
then who wins ?
close . we are so hush hush , even we know nothing about it . now let s see , there s coconut cake , date and walnut i recommend the rum baba . . .
hmmm . . .
my number two . special assignments . she is
how curious . . .
father will be your controller . steed here will show you the ropes .
welcome to mobile h . q . weather s turning quite nasty . sir august was blown to smithereens . along with half of banffshire . the ministry s worried .
would it be possible to use it for military purposes ?
london . the world council of ministers meets soon on global defence . if you can control the weather , you control the world .
i resign .
you need treatment , mrs . peel . you cannot resign .
what are you trying to do to me ?
we want to help . . . !
i thought i was a widow . my husband . . . the only man i ever loved . . . is dead . for the rest of my life i have to live with that .
the death of peter peel was a great loss . to us all . . .
peter peel was a first class agent . a senior operative . x department special operations . he was engaged in top secret research . top priority . government approved .
the institute . . . the funding . . .
who ?
this is an official matter , mrs . peel . no need to take it personally . where are you going ?
to find out who killed my husband .
the doors and walls are monitored , mrs . peel . this is a very secure establishment .
about your next assignment , mrs . peel . . .
ahem . as i was saying , perhaps another macaroon . . .
good luck . . . peter . . . emma .
you .
a slight miscalculation my face was burned beyond recognition . fortunately my research into plastics came in handy . . .
dr . darling , peter . . . all you . . .
an unholy trinity . . .
you killed my husband .
for starters . of course i had to kill the teddy bears , as well . . .
too many cooks
spoil the majority shareholders . in wonderland weather . i planned everything , even the ministry recruiting you . . .
but i found you . all the clues led me here . . .
of course . i planned that , too .
but why ?
you disappoint me , emma . cannot you guess ? for you . it was all for you . . .
our revels now are ended .
think of this as your second wedding feast . . .
i am already married . . .
you know , i believe she is actually jealous .
valentine , listen to me . . .
right , bridesmaid . now what have i left out ? oh , yes , i know the ring .
that is better . i say , is not this where you came in ? it is impenetrable , by the way . . .
you are mad .
such as ?
destruction of their local weather systems . i can zap a thousand chernobyls into the air .
the result would be . . .
chaos . transport paralysis . crop failure . economic disaster . frostbite or sunburn . . . on a massive scale . you have seen a few samples . . .
then that is stopping you ?
the missing piece of the jigsaw . i tried to get you to give it to me as peter i tried to steal it from you as dr . darling . as myself i will be a bit less subtle . with this ring my plan will be complete .
how wagnerian . . . do you mean to say you have waited all these years because you could not create a chip on your own ? that would have amused peter .
speaking of peter , there s more good news you will not even have to change your last name . you will always be mrs . peel .
what are my choices ?
choices ?
doctor peel , i presume ?
i was about to throw in the towel .
i had a spot of bother at the door .
i should not wonder . not a woman inside boodles since
. why the kippers ?
red herring would have been too obvious , do not you think ?
so what was all this some sort of test ?
congratulations , you have penetrated a bastion of male privilege . i guessed you were not a stickler for tradition , doctor .
whereas you are .
dyed in the wool . but i can admire someone who does not play by the rules .
rules are made to be broken .
not by me . play by the rules , doctor , or the game is nothing .
and just what is the game ?
i say , this is all terribly formal . must i go an calling you dr . peel ?
under the circumstances , you may call me mrs . peel .
much better .
and now that we have settled the matter of honorifics , will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you ?
i did not . mother did .
. . . showers followed by sunny periods .
ah . . . from trubshaw s . my shoemaker .
my father always wanted a boy .
really ? i fail to see the connection .
do you ?
i thought we were on our way .
oh , absolutely , but trubshaw s a man worth meeting . no point setting out half shod .
steed , we really must be
you can but i wish you would not . . .
that place is so absurd , so out of date . . .
you know what i mean . this car and you . nobody walks around like that . milk ?
but why ? that is the point ?
a gentleman has to have a code . this is part of mine . a uniform . think of it as my suit of shining armor .
and i suppose you are the knight .
the most unpredictable piece on the board . and always ready to protect his queen .
sir august merryweather . . . why are we seeing him first ?
as per mother s instructions .
do we always follow mother s instructions ?
for a man in my position
just what is your position , if you do not mind my asking . how did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work ?
they call me in when they have reached a dead end . freelance . like yourself .
i have no choice . why should you risk your life ?
after our fencing match , i was rather hoping you would do the risking . more tea ?
no thanks .
according to mother , sir august owns half of the highlands . a millionaire . former head of special projects at the ministry . now . . .
not so much eccentric . more barking mad . he has a wife called june . and a daughter somewhere julie .
june , july . . . august ?
the family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined .
any other vices ?
so . . . i distract him while you snoop around ? how ?
ah , brenda . . . mrs . peel ?
you should be dead . how do you feel ?
strange .
you were very lucky . four shots to the heart . i found you after i slipped away from sir august . mother brought you here . not me you should thank .
i was not about to .
i mean your man trubshaw . your bullet proof waistcoat . i thought you were just overdressed .
mother and dr . darling have me under observation . they think i tried to kill you .
why should they think that ?
you told them . you said i arrived on a camel , shot you four times . left you for dead .
frankly that is how i remember it .
but that is absurd . i may not be over fond of you , steed , but it is not my style .
perhaps your memory plays tricks , mrs . peel .
that is possible . sir august was convinced he would met me before . but i would never met him . another odd thing . when it rained , he said it was just as someone had promised .
did he say who ?
an invitation . to a formal picnic . . . ?
i must say , you look more your old self
you mean my other self . . .
either way . . . may i ask why you dress in that fashion ?
colonel crabtree . international satellite systems . formerly of the ministry .
elementary , mrs . peel . trubshaw is not the only shoemaker still practicing his trade . . .
what on earth ?
any ideas ?
well , he was a fellow of the royal zoological society . . .
is that written in his shoe ?
common knowledge , mrs . peel . . .
for you , mrs . peel .
but
not quite . this is my field .
is there anything that is not ?
the prospero project was started by my husband . it was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming . in theory , climate engineering is entirely feasible . we thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite . a quick fix . . .
filling in mother nature s blind spots . . . ?
exactly . there would been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea . propane gas mostly . in small quantities it captures chlorine . protects the ozone layer . but it proved impractical . too bulky . . .
but if someone miniaturized the process . . .
that is what we were working on .
three agents killed by bad weather . . .
. . . and by you , mrs . peel . . .
then a mad millionaire . head of a secret defense establishment . a group of eccentrics obsessed by weather . . .
. . . and by you , mrs . peel . everything points to you . no sisters ? no undiscovered twin ?
not that i know of . explanation ?
is that what you think ?
do you always drive this fast ?
what , lady disdain ? are you yet breathing ?
barely .
this must be the last straw .
here s the one that broke the camel s back .
someone did not want us to get to the party .
steed . . . !
where am i ?
the winslow home for retired lepidoptorists . i am so sorry i struck you , mrs . peel . please forgive me . i thought you were someone else . . .
was i ?
i expect that is for you to know and me to find out . . .
you followed me .
orders .
to kill me ?
i could save you the trouble .
no trouble .
because you always obey orders . . .
yes . . . ?
and do you trust me ?
i could be convinced , if . . . i knew who poisoned me in the maze . that kiss . . .
mmm . . . what are you doing ?
keeping a stiff upper lip ?
but you did suspect me .
not for a moment .
you are playing games .
are not we all , mrs . peel ?
i thought you played by the rules .
i thought you did not .
i am playing to win .
winning is not everything .
please do not tell me it is how you play the game .
no , after you .
you do not trust me ?
i told mother i took care of you .
you lied .
drat . someone wants to implicate you in this affair , mrs . peel . any idea who ?
no idea who . no idea why . . .
teddy bears , cuckoo clocks , toys all childrengs things . . .
. . . or grown ups , who still like to be children .
quite . any childhood friends ? enemies ?
very well . i have a friend who might be of assistance . he is at the ministry . we would better be careful .
his name s jones . invisible jones .
why s he called invisible ?
are not you coming ?
we must hurry , mrs . peel . . .
hurry ? what for ? i am just now
there s a reception this evening . colonel jones thinks it advisable we attend .
that is that you are wearing ?
it is called black leather .
what is it ?
limpet bomb . small , very compact . from trubshaw s .
when all this is over , we simply must get you out of that suit .
you first .
trubshaw again ? what now ?
they are playing your song , mrs . peel .
bad news . father s looking for you . where are those bloody ministers ?
i will be back . . .
where are you going ?
laying in supplies , mrs . peel weather may get very nasty and i have no umbrella . . .
you need not bother . i cannot drag you further into this . after all , i am still the chief suspect .
no bother . mother and father think i have joined you . i might as well .
but
oh , and by the way , i think it is about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder .
mrs . peel ?
what kept you ?
the owl and the pussycat went to sea
. . . in a beautiful pea green boat . . .
a fine night , mrs . peel . . .
still a bit chilly . . .
english weather . you know , after all we have been through , i should say we deserve a long holiday . . .
have you any place in mind ?
i do not recall siberia being this warm , steed .
it is the latest thing , mrs . peel .
our little paradise just made for two ?
our chaperon .
ah . . . sun tan lotion . any shops nearby ?
your mission is simple . find out how and why these agents died .
think of it as special assignment , mrs . peel . with a twist . you are our chief suspect .
where is mother ?
you do not believe him ?
emma in wonderland . welcome , mrs . peel . we have been expecting you . we hope you will enjoy your stay with us . decontamination is almost complete .
decontamination ?
talk to the pipe , mrs . peel . that usually helps . do not worry about me being invisible . other than that i am perfectly normal .
i see .
ah , here we are . steed asked me to play a hunch valentine peel .
peter s brother ? but
now let s see . . . eton , cambridge . . . research into robotics and plastics . overtaken by peter s work on the physics of climate change . . .
i know all this .
do you also know that during your final experiment , your halfbrother in law was under surveillance ?
surveillance ? by whom ?
father . she gave him an all clear after a security test by dr . darling .
who s now vanished .
makes two of us .
i was getting to it .
getting to what ?
the world council of ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative
under the circumstances mother did not see fit , but i think i can get you in . . .
x marks the spot . the shoes were delivered to . . . an island in hyde park . surrounded by the serpentine . on the site of a former ministry installation . . .
privately owned by . . .
let me guess wonderland weather .
very good , mrs . peel . . .
i shall need a small plane .
you are not venturing alone , surely .
a series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns . . .
global warming ?
we know one thing . that suspect was not mrs . peel .
oh , hello . . .
we want mrs . peel .
steed
how did you guess ?
you reek of mrs . peel s black leather . . .
mother betrayed me . she was going to replace me with a younger father . errand boy that is all i was . find steed . . .
mother . i thought you were burglars .
weather s turning nasty .
you did not come to talk about the weather , surely .
your research into climate engineering was state of the art . your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming had they succeeded . we need your expertise .
think she really killed those agents ?
she may not know . theory goes she may be very ill .
amnesia ?
possibly . split personality . . .
insane . . . ?
who knows ? if dr . darling is right , you should watch out .
why ?
something went wrong . system malfunction . explosion . mrs . peel had a narrow escape . suspected sabotage . nothing proven . file still open .
still does not . better safe than sorry . she was in a dangerous game , steed . high stakes . she may prove to be a risk . if she is , there s only one solution . termination .
anyone particular in mind ?
we had a lead to wonderland weather but we got there too late . someone tipped them off . . .
too late anyway . today s escapade was only for starters . this is no ordinary weather . it is manmade . a kind of weather bomb .
this man did you see him ?
you are accusing mrs . peel of killing her own husband ?
pity . i was growing fond of mrs . peel . unfortunately
guilty until proven innocent ?
i was hoping you could tell me .
you are getting yourself into terrible trouble , my son . weather s turning very nasty and so am i .
i am going to follow up on a hunch of my own . if i am right , mrs . peel is innocent and you have a mole .
where ?
in your operation .
are you alright , young man ?
cocky little bastard . i hope he was a baddy .
i feel sure of it .
i am alice . mother said you would be on your way . mrs . peel with you ?
you with mother or father ?
both , actually .
good . glad to see they are together at last . they do not get along . promotion . top job . most unfair . quite a fuss at the ministry .
wonderland weather ltd .
mrs . peel ?
ask not for whom the telephone rings . . .
no , please ! i beg you . . .
walk over to the window . . .
let it be rain , please let it be
john steed .

the last one you will ever see .
you are better than i expected .

if i were you , i would worry less about the shower and more about rick s bachelor party .
ilene , why would i want to do that ? i trust rick .
of course you do . i trusted my ex , mel , too . cousin , i can only talk from experience . what do you think they do at these parties , have tea and play scrabble ?
ilene , rick promised . . .
are you sure this is a good idea ?
look , you heard what those hookers said . they were supposed to go to a bachelor party .
that does not mean it was rick s party .
let s go .
look , girls i will stay behind and hold them off . the rest of you break for it !
ilene , are you crazy ?
i am using the same caterer for the shower i had for our christmas party last year .

this is the park view hotel . i am the hotel manager . are you looking for someone ?
it is on the tenth floor .
keep your voices down . this is a respectable establishment . we do not go for any funny business here . just then a guy with a moosehead beer hat and two guys in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys .
you are all under arrest . open up !
oops !
rick , hit the ball easier , son . you do not have to kill it .
well , i have to admit my game s a little rusty , but i love polo . it is unrelenting , a constant challenge to the senses . really a beautiful experience .
rick , i want to cut through the b . s .
i would love that .
good . i think you are an asshole . no , let me correct that , an immature asshole . which is fine , except you are marrying my daughter and i am afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes .
mr . thomerson , i . . .
let me finish . debbie s an adult . she can do what she wants . but if you want your marriage to last , you are going to have to change some things about yourself . if i may make some suggestions . . .
feel free .
welcome , welcome , one and all .
rick !
the end .
ebbie . ger . . . umph . . . lable . . .
er . . . perhaps we ought to stop now .
girls , why do not we go inside for lunch . boys , would you mind bringing in that lemonade ?
the thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck .
ed . . . you are kinky !
the phone made me do it !

you always were sneaky , stan , very sneaky .
rick , marriage will be good for you . it is done wonders for me .
true , you are a lot handsomer now . do not you have enough blood already ?
you will not miss a thing about being single . . . the wild parties , the different girls every night , running around like a maniac . . . god , i miss that .
that is an even trade . . . a cotton ball for all my blood .
nah , that is okay . my brother has to look up old people s asses all day long . let s give him a break .
thanks a lot , that was the best . you are next .
nah , not yet . look , you are my older brother . i need some advice here . that is the deal with marriage ? what can i expect ?
well , the first month it is great . the second month things calm down a little . by the third month you are looking through your old girlfriends phone numbers by the fourth month you are numb by the fifth month , hopefully the football season starts .
oh . . . it is . . . er . . . the guys from the beer convention . we are bringing them to the party .
you are late again , rick .
i know , sister , but i have a very good excuse .
there can be no excuse for tardiness .

it is okay , stephen , i
i saw it .

when dad died , i saw another fire . . .
everybody did .
i saw it before it got them . i tried to yell , but . . . he asked me to look out for him . and i did not do it . i let him die .
. . . jesus , you been carrying that around for twenty years ? for christ s sake , you were seven years old ! you think he could have heard you in there ?
i hate him so much sometimes , stephen . you do not know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on . . .
maybe i do . . . . what a fucking mess , huh ? people can change brian .
oh god , stephen , that is going on with you ?
stephen , wait a minute . i gotta talk to you . it is adcox , he is
what are you doing here ?
i saw adcox s back ! i saw the burn ! i put it there ! jesus christ , stephen , he is been killing people !
i know .
how do you know ?
i knew when you came looking for the chemicals . looking for me .
what were they doing there ?
anything else ?
what are we going to do about this ?
i will handle it .
we gotta go to rimgale , stephen .
you are his lt . , stephen . . . are you gonna handle it ? are you stephen ?
you crazy son of a bitch , why could not you stay behind a desk where you belong ?
you never know till the fire stares you down if you are gonna be
do not tell them about adcox . . . do not let em . . .
brian .
jennifer .
you are back .
you look great .
thanks for calling .
uh . . . i have been sorta keeping a low profile . . . the academy . . . i graduated today .
huh .
so . . . i see you are still in the neighborhood .
not quite . just visiting . i live in lincoln park now .
yeah ? what have you been up to ?
i work for city hall .
really ? no kidding .
well , if nothing else , it is nice to know we can still be friends .
with grenadine , right ?
when i was twenty .
look , i am not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a saturday night . this is not about fun . i am working here .
carrying swayzak s notebook ?
let me tell you something . martin swayzak is going to be this towngs next mayor .
yeah . swayzak . humanity s last hope . how can you work for that guy ?
why do you think marty came here tonight ? because he cares about your department . you do not know how hard he works . you do not know about his programs helping west side
all i know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt .
what was that ? oh man , you have picked up a few moves since john paul ii boulevard .
yeah , well i like to think i am just a little past hanging out on jp ii watching the irish pick fights and litwalks barf in the planters .
boy , took you all of thirty seconds to blow that .
c mon jennifer , he is just another north side jag off with a mouth .
brian , do you always have to be so stupid ? think about your future for once .
so now you suddenly care about my future ?
look , i did not mean to take a piece out of you back there , i just thought you would call when you came back . you did not and . . . do not blow it just because of this garbage between us .
i have been thinking about what you said the other night . . . if the offer s still on the table , i would like to talk about it .
. . . okay . i will arrange things with your assignment captain . marty s a good man , brian .
arson .
hey .
how is it going ?
boss and i are up to about three words an hour .
green committed to a thousand . there s another fund raising party tonight . marty would really like you to come .
i could use a date .
hi .
hey . . . so are you dating your boss or what ?
if you were not at least the th person to ask me that , i would probably be pissed . boy , you sure know it is a mangs world sometimes . . .
sorry . are you dating anyone ?
you think that is really any of your business ?
well , you did invite me here .
okay .
boy , rimgale s as slow as a snail , is not he ?
no , he is more of a dinosaur . guy s not a dummy , though . he is juggling alot of balls on this one .
yeah , but it does not take albert einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not .
jesus , give him a break . there is not enough proof yet to go public . sure , we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch em , and we have maybe figured out why backdrafts , but you cannot rush this stuff . not till it is locked .
but rimgale s probably going to come around to arson .
thanks for the invite .
got anything to drink in there ?
this is one of the oldest fire stations in the city . lotta tradition locked up in here . what do you think ?
homey .
see that trap door up there ? that used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse drawn engines . it was pretty different then . . . but kinda the same , y know ?
do you miss it ? you seem like you do .
when i came back , i knew more than anything else that i wanted to be a fireman .
then why did you quit ?
well , our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment . this area is the pumping panel , which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose .
brian . that is wrong ?
you told swayzak about our arson lead . it is all over the fucking news .
i did not know it was a secret . there are not supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators
bullshit ! you knew what i told you was not ready for the papers
will you please keep your voice down , there s people
you could have scared the son of a bitch off . we may never bust him now . all for a couple s political points .
i was doing my job .
yeah ? and just how much of all this has been doing your job ?
let me ask you something , do you really think marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills ? who the hell are you kidding ? i was there , remember ? i saw you and your brother
leave stephen out of this
oh yeah , he is the real fireman . who are you ? just another probie working for swayzak
i work for the city .
hi .
hi .
we still talking ? look , i am sorry about the other day
swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered . i want to know why he keeps that hidden .
i do not know anything about it .
you could check . it would be in his files .
do you know what you are asking me to do ?
yes .
y know , four years ago i was working in a bakery . two years ago i was bringing marty coffee and he did not even know my name . i run that office now . marty believed in me and i believe in him . you want me to just throw that away ?
what is
i am sorry .
that is a dumb thing to say .
i think your boss is going to need some spin control .
i quit two days ago , brian .
what will you do ?
i do not have the slightest idea . . .
i will see ya around , huh ?
brian mccaffrey . . . oh this is really a treat . brian mccaffrey . lost a dad to the animal , huh ?
i am close . . . but i cannot get who it is . . .
okay , here s the deal . i will tell you a story , you tell me one . fair ?
who s doing this ?
your first question should be who is not . it is not a spark , brian . not enough damage . and an insurance pro ? where is the profit margin ?
then who
no no , your turn . tell me a story .
i do not have a story .
famous story even . straight burn . just an engine and truck first on scene . what did you feel , brian , when you first got there ?
what ?
you gotta tell a story too , brian . it is fair . c mon , do not think too hard
i . . . i thought it was great . i loved it . it was nothing to these guys . . . medium deal .
right . light smoke , low roll . couple a civilians hollering medium deal . so young fireman adcox and captain mccaffrey , they head up stairs , get out on the fire escape mccaffrey does the ballsy jump across . . . what were you feeling , brian ? c mon , you promised . be honest . okay . . . guard !
i wanted to be him . right then i wanted to be him more than anything . . .
very good , brian . about your report here . the way to a torch s heart is through his tools . that is how you know him . it is the way he talks to the fire . and to you if you listen .
the outlets .
that is a probie answer . you are smarter than that , brian .
trychticholorate .
who the fuck is doing this ?
oh jesus christ . . .
if it was a joke , sir , you would be laughing .
you walked out on this academy six years ago . one week to graduation . you think we forgot that ? you think i did ?
i want another shot , sir .
look , everybody remembers your old man . being his son , all you had to do was breathe to graduate here . dead hero father rule . but you blew us off . why should i take you back ?
if you remember , sir , my test scores were in the top
i do not give a damn what your test scores were , maybe you could have been a good firemen , but you had your shot .
i need another one , sir .
sorry , but it is out of my hands . try again next year .
no , it is not out of your hands or you would not even have met me . if i push you have to let me back in . dead hero father rule . sir .
even if you graduate this academy , you have still got nine months of probation . that is hard duty , son . if you do not really love this job , it will kill you .
uh , i am brian mccaffrey . your new assistant .
are you still here ?
get used to me , inspector . i am not going anywhere .
then go find a corner . i do not want you in my way .
i think we should get something straight here . i was assigned to this office by the city .
where are you going ?
shhh .
so you were happy here . warm and cozy and in no hurry . . . soot high , clean unburned wall low , indicates slow burn in thermal balance . find me some glass .
glass ?
glass found in ignition room is in small , thin pieces , indicating explosion . lack of discoloration indicates a long , slow burn . explosion must of come after a slow burn . you little tease . . . what were you up to you little bastard , huh ? what made you that mad ? or scared . it started in this room . took its time , hung out . . . but the air ran out . it could not breathe . so it was snuffed . but it was not dead . . . still all that trapped heat , lying low , waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air . . .
temperature in this room was about degrees , but copper wire in outlet is melted , which requires degrees . an accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of degrees , hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire .
uh , i do not think that is in my contract . . .
read .
trychtichlorate is a binary structured
go to the bottom . under heat properties .
during heat episodes of kelvin or higher , trych breaks down and dissipates . will consume magnesium .
son of a bitch tears em apart just to eat the oxygen . would not take much at all to melt ten gauge wire . problem s burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace unless you could find something that would eat its residue .
look , it is not proof , okay ? someone may have put the chemical in the outlet , but we found it as a vapor in cosgrove s clothes .
and the putty around the door ?
even if it was used to seal the air off , that does not explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft . a gungs a helluva lot easier
but the right guess on this is arson .
i do not guess .
some people say you do not do much of anything when it comes to this case .
that is it ! oh , that son of a bitch , he is different , goddamn it ! you see what this tells us , huh ? our killer does not love fire !
what ?
i got it after we talked to ronald . torches . want to fry the whole goddamn world . but the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much . the burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls . and he made his burns backdrafts .
but he killed these guys .
but he could have killed everybody there . the firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall . the backdraft blew out the flame . that is it . that is the reason .
what reason ?
why backdrafts . whoever fried seagrave and cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire , but also made sure the fire blew itself out .
that is why the sealant on the doors . . . so what have we got , a torch with a conscience ?
no , we have a stone killer trying to make a point .
are you going public with this ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
in a word , brian , what is this job all about ?
hey boss , dekom trust is owned by pan illinois . . . which is majority controlled by lakeside dynamics . . . which is a division of windy city ventures . . . who s partners are . . . alan seagrave , donald cosgrove , and jeffrey holcomb .
so seagrave and holcomb were accountants . . .
and cosgrove . coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate . they were not very high on seagrave , either .
nice bunch of guys .
this is the copy of swayzak s manning report that was released . everybody on this job knows it is bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers . they are all airtight .
i have got three different drafts of the same report with different numbers that are all over the place . looks like they were just making it up as they went along .
did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report . they did exactly one job swayzak s manpower study . it is not even really a company . no employees , no directors , just a po box .
then who wrote the report ?
well brian , i guess you can say it is arson now . . .
did you pull me out ?
yeah .
did i say thanks ?
no .
just wondering .
so what do you want me to do ?
your brother was a good man .
yeah .
another couple of good men get burned up for their city ? is that how it is going to read ? you are the only one that knows .
brian ?
hi , helen . man , you look great .
about written you off . how long have you been in town ?
four months .
four months ?
that is sean ? jeez , he is a giant .
yeah , you would be surprised what three years can do to a kid .
sean , come on out , man . what , you forget your favorite uncle ?
well that is two things to strangle stephen for . where is he , anyway ?
oh , man , i am sorry .
yeah . big fan .
and i am a huge fan of what you did to save that woman , brian .
uh , i think there s been a mistake . i did not save that woman .
no need to be modest , brian .
no , you do not understand , i saved a mannequin .
that really was incredibly work you did . you and your brother , fighting fires together , helluva image , is not it ? you must feel lucky to be assigned under his command .
every little boy s fantasy .
brian , let me come to the point . i would like to offer you a job .
i have a job .
this one s still with the fire department . one of our best investigators , don rimgale , is working on a very difficult , visible case right now . we think he could use another pair of hands and you are exactly the kind of guy i want representing us an authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan .
yeah , we got all kinds of traditions like dying young .
mr . mccaffrey . . .
nice boat .
mr . mccaffrey . . . keeping busy ?
completely out of control .
are not you even curious ?
engine , right ?
how would you know ? these are supposed to be sealed .
lucky guess . and a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments .
you crooked son of a bitch . why ?
lots of fires . they promote faster there . take a look at the last lt . s list , half the guys on it came from that battalion . gotta think about your future , timmy . s the station .
man . something sure put a crimp in his evening .
do you have to do that ?
y know what stephen said to me , right when all the shit was coming hard ? you never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you are just gonna do this job or be great at it .
what ?
so , you surviving without me ?
there s no replacement cause of your boss cuts , if that is what you mean . if someone else goes out on an injury we are really screwed .
well , if it is not the littlest mccaffrey . hey ! you break anything with that you buy it ! sorry , there must be something wrong with my eyes . i keep thinking that is a fire department uniform .
really . well , let s have a look at what else was in your blood . i always look forward to getting these , they make such a nice collage for the bar . . . assistant director , sales , aspen snowmobile tours . . .
did not offer the kinda growth and challenge i need .
uh huh . and pioneer s pride , mobile log cabins . that was in your blood about six months was not it ?
management were pin heads .
laguna jamming , custom surfboards ?
coffee sucked .
and just this year , briangs sound spectrum . your own company even . big step .
i was ahead of my time .
who s going to die ?
brian . he is not doing it right , dad . he never does it right .
your brother s right . if you do not fasten these correctly they could open and you would get burned .
fireman shit ?
hey , that is with the mouth ? where would you grow up , a barn ?
firehouse .
dad !
i hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it .
stevie ? rimgale s here to see you .
i am busy .
he just wants to
we gotta roll , stevie . . .
i will be there .
they are waiting man .
uh , helen , i wanted to talk to you a second about sean . . .
you cannot talk about my brother like that . . .
stephen , what are you doing here ?
fixing my roof .
where is sean ?
he is got piano lessons .
oh yeah ? how is he doing ?
he is going to be a fireman .
give up , babe . you cannot fight it . believe me , my mom tried . . .
stephen , you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this .
i just wanted to , i do not know , not exactly apologize for the other night especially since i do not remember much of it
you remember .
yeah . . . i just thought i should say , i do not know , something .
the great communicator .
sorry i hit jackson .
he deserved it . he was born deserving it .
he treats you okay ?
okay .
i treated you better .
you want some coffee ?
coffee ? nah , i gotta go .
that is wrong , stephen ? c mon , you only beat up the roof when something s on your mind . how is brian doing ?
he is out .
i know he is out , but how is he doing ?
y know , i treated him better than any other probie i ever had . he probably hates my guts , but i did the best thing for him . i made him finally look in the mirror .
ah stephen , that is what this is really about , is not it ? you always have to be right .
hey , i am the first one to admit when i am wrong .
yeah ? when was the last time ?
in a fire ? never . look , i am his brother . i care about him , y know ? he was going to get himself killed . maybe not today , maybe not in a year , but it would have happened . and i could not i just could not . . .
i am sorry . . . i . . . could not sleep . . .
that is wrong ?
cook and i are almost finished here . have a seat .
look , i am sorry i
no , that is okay . it is just sean . . .
he is getting good on those eggs . and y know , he told me he actually likes the piano .
they ran the residue you scraped from both crispers front doors . it is a combination of plumber s putty and rayophene gum . burns almost completely away when you light it .
putty ? on both doors ?
anyway , down here , take a look . . .
see that patch of shirt ? we wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro . on a lucky shot we picked up some traces of trychticholorate . nobody around here had ever heard of it .
trychticholorate ? alright , it is an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents . it is pretty rare , they stopped making it a couple a years ago .
probably got in cosgrove s clothes in a gas state from the fire .
what the hell was it doing in the fire ?
shadow .
how ya doing , ronald . staying comfortable ?
did not think you would make it .
would not miss this for the world , pal .
who s this ?
he works for me .
is he a fireman ? i like firemen .
you do not know him .
knock it off . now .
tell him about me , shadow ?
ronald here likes telephones . used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton . came up with a whole little thing there , did not you ronald ? when you got bored , what did you do ? you just started making calls . . . mostly day care centers and retirement homes , was not it ?
did he tell you how we finally met ?
nobody cares , ronald .
sure ronald ? you are ready alright .
burn them .
and old ladies ?
burn them .
and the world the whole world .
got a cause ?
are the glory boys actually showing interest in investigationgs work ? i may have a stroke .
i am working on it .
i deal with this stuff every day . but a fireman . . . you never get used to it . what happened up there ? he was a candidate . did he pay attention ? was he listening ?
. . . he was not listening to the right thing . . .
what do you listen to , stephen ?
you do not know . . . nobody knows . . .
it knows us . this one knows us .
alderman swayzak .
investigator rimgale .
inspector .
when are you going to catch the prick that is doing this , don ?
don ?

that there was never any other way it could have gone . never any other way . so you had better just put in my fucking bet . , on the last game . the big one . come on ! are you a bookmaker , or fucking what ?
forgive me father , for i have sinned . it has been two days since my last confession . father , my sin is a terrible sin . a sin of omission . there was another sin that happened at the same time , and in the same place , but my sin i think was graver stil .
father , if it was so trivial , so natural , so no . i have sinned . and you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition , and to absolve me . father , what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve god ?
it is funny , you knew . but the first thing i think of is kneading the bread that i help bake for the soup kitchen . maybe that is because my the muscles in my arms still hurt .
i also thought of that bread , father . and of that night six days ago when the mother superior died , and i kept the cool , damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist . father , what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve god ?
i think of running for help , and falling to my knees in prayer .
as i have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning and my sin . you see , father
yes , sister ?
those boys , those sad , raging boys . . . they came to me as the needy do . and like many of the needy , they were rude . like all the needy , they took . and like all the needy , they needed . father . i knew them they learn in our school . and play in our schoolyard . and they are good boys .

ahh , the luxuries of life .
yo , check it . this is good and all that but one day soon i want to have much benjamins so i can have a nice crib and pay all my bills . you hear me .
chill , i am the brains behind this outfit .
and i am the feet .
yo , you gotta show some patience . you want me to snap my fingers and presto chango you are an overnight sensation . son , there is no such thing .
we ran out without my shoes and the floor . i gotta get my stuff . what about our savings ?
we got evicted from our home . we have both been on the streets for the last week .
we was coming to see you .
if it is not too much trouble could you order us some food ?
that ai not funny .
manray , sloan says you are too talented to be dancing on the street .
my tap shoes .
what do i have to do ?
some tap dancing , some singing .
how different ?
trust me . of course i still have to pitch it to my boss , but we will have an answer one way or the other .
dela , i am aboard . as long as i get to hoof and get paid too ! ! !
i would like to change your name .
to what ?
you are now mantan .
i want you to start using the name mantan and not manray if you do not mind .
why ?
mantan ?
i am not playing myself no mo .
how you sound ?
i will not do it anymore .
manray , i am very sorry about ya boy cheeba and sloan . believe me , it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her , just looking out for a brother . i feel you , all this stuff happening at once but you cannot let if affect your work . you gotta be professional .
i am always gonna be that . but i ai not doing no more buck dancing .
our guest today is pierre delacroix . he is the creator of the highly controversial tv show mantan . let s get right into it . you have been called by some in the community a traitor , a sellout , an uncle tom . why does your show generate such feelings ?
because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country . gary , i have no problem with people disagreeing with the show , it is when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist , that is when i get mad . no one , in any way , shape or form should be censored .
no matter how sexist or racist the material may be ?
yes . and i say yes because who is to judge ? who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not ? who ? who can play god ?
but the line has to be drawn .
do not you people get it ? we are in the st century . slavery was over four hundred years ago . all that stuff people talked in the old days , it is over . folks always crying , white man this , white man that . let s all grow up .
are you trying to excuse our holocaust ?
. . . exactly thirty two minutes ago .
i am sorry i am late .
do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone ?
four minutes ago .
so are you telling me everyone knew about this get together except you ?
do you know what c . p . time is ?
i am sorry about my blowup but i have to have a whipping boy every meeting .
i understand . but again , in all honesty i was not informed .
i understand black culture . i grew up around black people all my life . if the truth be told i probably know niggers better than you , monsieur delacroix . please do not get offended by my use of the quote unquote n word . i got a black wife and three bi racial children , so i feel i have a right to use that word . i do not give a damn what spike says , tarantino is right . nigger is just a word . if dirty ole bastard can use it every other word so can i .
i would prefer you not use that word in my presence .
the material you have been creating is too white bread . white people with black faces . the huxtable s , cosby , revolutionary . but that is dead . we cannot go down that road again .
i do not agree . the negro middle class does exist , and it is rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom .
the middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave . the middle class black family moves into a small southern town that is run by the kkk . the middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter . the middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter . the middle class single black mother raises her teenage son . and so on and so forth . it is too clean , too antiseptic . . .
delacroix , wake up , brother man . the reason why they did not get picked up was because nobody and i mean nobody niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk .
i have never been given a fair shot .
you got your head stuck up your ass with your harvard education and your pretentious ways . brother man , i am blacker than you . i am keeping it real and you are fronting , trying to be white .
i am an oreo , a sell out ? because i do not aspire to do homeboys from out of space , secret diary of desmond pfeiffer , a pj s or some as you might put it , some nigger show ? i am a tom ? i am whiter than white and you are blacker than black ? is that what you think ?
that is exactly what i think . i want you to create something that people want to see . let s be honest , the majority of the people in the country are deaf , dumb and blind and i am including million african americans . you know and i know niggers set the trend , set the styles . this is a golden opportunity now . these idiots have to be led to the water .
i am not sure if i can deliver what you want .
what is it you want from me ? some plantation follies ? some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch ? some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads ? you want me to go back to the ante bellum days ?
delacroix , i am glad you got your mind right .
we are all happy to be here and i am going to paint a picture for you .
i am wid it .
i have done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right . in my previous work it is been all surface , superficial . i have never really dug deep . not anymore . as mark twain fully understood satire is the way . race has always been a hot button in this country s history and it needs to be pushed harder . if we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony . it is about promoting racial healing .
go on . good so far .
word ! ! !
so let s take this great form , this very american tradition of entertainment into the st century , into the new millennium .
the name of the show ?
it is called mantan the new millennium minstrel show .
i am feeling dis !
it will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the cns to get this on the air . in fact , i would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque , too controversial .
do not worry about that , that is my department . now who do we cast ? we need a star . can whoopi sing or dance ?
i do not know if whoopi is the way to go .
that is a great handle .
mantan and sleep n eat . two real coons . i know we are way out there but it is satire .
every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons mantan and sleep n eat . the dusky duo .
what are there character traits ?
ignorant , dullwitted , lazy , and unlucky .
exactly !
mantan is an uneducated negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire .
and sleep n eat is his comical sidekick ?
yep , you guessed it .
protest finally forced amos and andy off the air . could stop us from ever getting on .
negroes would be in an uproar .
so what . we would just give the naacp a donation that would be the end of that . no such thing as bad publicity . so what . earlier you said singing and dancing .
mantan right here is a gifted hoofer . he has educated feet .
who are the other characters ?
we gonna hit em wid da bomb dickey on dis one . that is the setting ?
in the projects . like eddie murphy s the pj s .
and every week these alabama porch monkeys will make us cry , make us laugh , make us look at our own humanity . make us feel good to be alive .
i do not know about that plantation angle .
that iswhati amtalkingabout . that iswhati amtalkingabout ! he is off the hiz hook !
we think so .
i strongly feel that a negro should direct this . this kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm . one misstep and we are doing amos and andy . only a negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain .
i was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself , if not the pilot soon after .
i want a hot , young white director . maybe the kid , that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy madonna video .
you are telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot ?
i just want you to meet him . keep an open mind .
besides , what does he know about negroes ?
probably nuthing , but that is why it is such a sexy way to go . sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook , a different unique perspective . a black director , y know what he is gonna do given the subject matter ? with this kid , the possibilities are endless .
what are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky madonna video ?
if spielburg can direct the color purple and amistad , our whiz kid can direct the mantan pilot .
that is exactly my point . has he even directed actors before in anything ?
in the immortal words of derrick coleman , whooopdeedamndoo ! ! !
i am gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone .
i will not be held responsible for these revisions . these changes are not the way i want to go . this is an outrage . this is a sham . a violation !
i do not give a good goddamn about finland , norway , sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from .
we just punched it up a bit . made it funnier .
funnier to who and at who s expense ? dunwitty , when negroes start to run amok , the boycotts , when the demostrations commence , i am giving them your home address . let s see how you like it when they picket your lawn in greenwich , connecticut .
yo , dela , i just got the news from the cns brass . they saw some clips from the pilot and they are rushing it onto the air . yo , we are a midseason replacement , ordered shows . we are on in weeks . didya hear what i just said , yo ?
they did not even view a rough cut , just some scenes we quickly cut together .
this has to be a big mistake .
the big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier . from the gitgo , from jump street .
hold on a sec , i got a call .
hello , mommy , let me get rid of this other call .
i gots to go , it is my moms .
what do you want ?
i want to speak with you .
go away , unless you got my money .
son . good to seeya . good to seeya .
it is been a long time .
pull up a chair . oh , excuse me , this is my lady dot .
good woman . i trained her right .
daddy , she is younger than me .
purely for medicinal purposes .
i did . i am not an alcoholic . i just like to drink .
how did you end up here ?
that is what i am asking .
because i had too much pride . too much integrity . i would not lick nobody s butt . some material i refused to do .
that is the only reason , period . they only want one certain kind of black comic .
another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back ?
enough about me , that is happening with you ?
dem white boys giving you a hard time ?
nuthing i cannot handle .
the truth is never let them seeya sweat . you do that , that is half the battle .
where do you go from here ?
three nights charleston , south carolina .
i did not mean that , in life .
let s get him over to the bed .
i love you too , daddy .
glad to meet you , too . you are all your father talks about .
how long has my father been like this ?
not that often . he was excited to see you .
so he drank himself into a stuper ?
the drinking is for the pain . it does not kill it , just dulls it .
so that is up with you ?
do not tell him it is from me or he will not take it .
he never showed it .
how was it ?
why did not you tell me about this staff meeting ?
nobody told me anything .
what good are you if you do not tell me stuff like this ?
manray !
how did you know ?
it hit me like a ton of bricks .
how can this be ? you and me at the same time , the exact same thought . it is scary .
manray was under our nose the whole time .
do you know how you will use him ?
you lost me .
dunwitty wants a coon show . and that is what i am going to give him , it is going to be so racist , so negative , he will not have the balls to put it on the air . hence i will prove my point .
what point is that ?
the point being that him , the networks do not want black people on television unless they are buffoons .
sounds risky to me .
you getting cold feet ?
i am in till the end .
good . i am going to need your support .
cannot you just quit ? walk away ?
maybe something happened to them . maybe they are lying in an alley bleed to death .
hello .
you okay ?
what is your problem ?
my problem is mantan the new millenium minstrel show .
why did you even come up with that shit if you did not want it made ?
it was the principle . dunwitty had to be enlightened . i was making a point . i take pride in my work . plus , i already told you i was not gonna walk away from my money .
even if money was not an issue , dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous .
that is the chances of mantan being picked up ?
i would not bet against it . my negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place .
good morning , for those of you who do not know me , i am pierre delacroix . i am running things and this here is my assistant sloan hopkins .
hello .
this is the group i was telling you about .
which one is your brother ?
you have said that already .
just want to say good luck .
your life will never be the same .
let s leave the man in peace so he can get ready .
we both lied to him .
what do you want me to say ?
same here .
i want to apologize about my brother and the mau mau s . i should not have imposed them on you .
who s side are you on ?
what would their reaction be ? i had not the foggiest .
so you have your small victory , now what ?
what is this ?
a gift .
for what ?
the jolly nigger bank .
this is authentic , not a repro , circa turn of the century .
thanks .
i thought it was appropiate .
is that good or bad ?
it is all good . you got a hit show , you are gonna need a bank . plus , i love these old black collectibles .
how so ?
why would you do that ?
i do not want to hear it .
how long have you and hambone been hanging out ?
you are the one that put us together . we are friends .
that crazy brother of yours does not think so .
he is just playing big brother .
oh , is he ? you getting jiggy with mantan ?
please do not go there .
dunwitty and i feel you have been getting too close to him , getting his mind all messed up .
i cannot lie to him . if he asks me something , i tell him what i think .
dela , you should try it sometime . come into the light .
light ?
that which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light . this bucket of blood .
this is crazy .
that was a mistake , but i do not regret it .
the first and only time . a big mistake . i am gonna have to ask you not to see mantan anymore .
otherwise . i trust you know the difference . you are an intelligent woman , finished at nyu .
dela , kiss my big black ass .
do not make me have to use this .
i told you but you would not listen . you never listened to me .
yes , your name ?
he , i am mona .
hi , mona .
i perfectly understand where you are coming from . as a minority i can relate to your struggle also . but i think you should give us all a chance . we want this pilot to be successful just as much as you . please do not be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness .
this thing was rigged , the deck was stacked , the fix was in . could don king be near ? good thing sloan had my back . she is my rock . this was going to be a whole lot of work .
david , i appreciate your comments . anybody got an ideas ? everybody just talk out loud .
i am happy for all of us . it is just we have a great responsibility now . the pressure is on .
pressure ? dela , you do not know what the hell real pressure is . sheeett ! ! ! this is lightstuff . now when you scrambling out on the street in da january winter and the hawk is talking to you with no money and no prospects of money anytime soon , now that there is some pressure .
that is the way it came out . let me ask you one question . have you ever been in want , in need your entire privileged life ?
now i am privileged ? ! why ? because i did not grow up on food stamps and welfare ? because i did not call home a cardboard box ? no , i never ever went to bed hungry and i am proud of it , too . whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you .
can i kiss you too ?
naw . i will take the zero .
you feel good , not nervous ?
i feel fine .
not nervous ? relaxed ?
so they can be on tv .
you sound like the media .
this is nothing . it will blow over by tomorrow .
same thing giuliani said .
no joke . serious .
hope the same thing does not happen to me . that is some big shoes to fill .
what are you ? a man or a mouse ? are you a punk ? punking out on me ?
no .
you getting scared because some people do not like what you are doing ?
you have made it from the guttermost to the uppermost . do not you know you should never let them see you sweat . y knowwhati amsaying ?
yeah .
you should not even be mad at me over sloan .
what you did is dead wrong .
oh , is it ? buddy boy , in this business if people do not produce , they get fired .
sloan is the hardest working person i have ever met .
let me ask you a question , if i may . how do you think she got the job in the first place ? i do not mean to burst your bubble , mantan the marvelous , but sloan is an opportunity .
i do not believe it .
mantan , we got a show to tape .
my name is manray , goddamnit .
you must think i am some kind of fool .
it looks delicious .
you hear me talking to you . the only time you come up here when something is wrong .
c mon , mommy , do not start with that i am an ungrateful son stuff .
how is the food ?
cannot beat it with a hammer . well , since you asked , it looks like i may have a new show , a pilot being shot .
it was . it is . but this is a different kind of show .
if at first it is not what you want , just work that much harder , peerless .
mommy , please do not call me that .
son , peerless is your name . now you might be one of these hollywood types , change your name and all that but peerless dothan is on your birth certificate .
i know that is on my birth certificate . you heard from daddy ?
i guess he is still on the road . what kind of show is this ? are they some negroes in it without being buffoons ?
to answer your question , there are a lot of negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons ?
peerless , i did not raise a buffoon . we have enough of those on television already .
please let me know when you hear from daddy , get a number or something .
peerless , your father called .
he wants you to come and see him .
he said that ?
yes he did .
where is he ?
he is performing at some place outside of richmond , virginia .
richmond is not all the way down south .
i do not even know why you are still concerned over him . daddy s not with you .
regardless , he still is your father .
it is gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off .
even more reason to see him . he will be overjoyed with your success .
c mon , mommy . daddy has not been impressed with anything i have ever done . from winning my fifth grade spelling bee to the present .
i am doing okay . been reading about your show , it is all over everywhere . i watched it is all over everywhere . i watched it once . i thought you said there would be no buffoonery .
you going to attack me too . the show is a hit . are not you happy for me ?
of course i am happy for you . you have worked very hard for your success .
yes i have , very hard . has daddy called ?
no .
not at all ?
you know how your daddy is .
if and when he calls , please do not forget to ask him if he is seen mantan .
i will not forget . when are you coming up here to see your mother ?
nice to meet you . if you do not mind me asking you how old are you ?
where are you from ?
helsinki , which is the capital of finland .
finland .
you know , finlandia vodka ? yes ?
yes , i know . jukka , have you ever seen a negro person before ? even had a real conversation with a real negro before ?
a fiasco . a disaster . a boondoggle . an abomination .
did you just ask me that is a negro ? i am a negro ! ! !
ahhh ! ! ! i never heard of that term before . i thought you were black of african american . no ?
well before there was black or african american , there were negroes . i am a negro .
how did you get this gig ?
my visual style is very erotic , sexy , how do you say hot ?
this is a tv show , not a music video .
then will you teach me what i need to know . maybe we learn from each other , if that is possible , no ?
good luck , jukka . do a good show .
i know all of you have seen the overnight ratings . through the roof . but in this game you gotta be one , two , three steps ahead . i introduce you to myrna goldfarb . she is the best media consultant in the biz .
myrna is here to help us plan our strategy .
the mantan manifesto . catchy ai not it ? number one . we gainfully employ african americans , in front of and behind the cameras . two . let the audience decide . three . who put these critics in charge ? these so called cultural police ? four . who determines what is black ? five . mantan is a satire . six . if they cannot take a joke , f em .
let myrna finish .
yes you !
i never had a really real pair before .
you have never had any formal training , either ?
not a class , not a thing , just picked stuff up by myself .
i wish i had your natural talent . god only makes that visit once in a while .
you sing and dance ?
a little . i just graduated from nyu film school . cinema studies .
so that is up with you and dela ?
what do you mean ?
no , we are not knocking boots . i got this internship while i still was at nyu , dela was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant .
i am sure that was the only thing he was impressed with . you look beautiful like that .
if that was suppose to be a compliment , i thank you .
you are welcome . you should not give up on performing .
why do you say that ? you have never seen me .
i think that would probably make you the happiest . when i am hoofing , i mean really doing my thing , hitting it , nothing compares to that feeling in the world .
our guest tonight is the extraordinary , talented performer , mantan . thanks for coming in .
tavis , thank you for having me .
before we begin , i want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview . you could have chosen mike wallace , barbara walters , jane pauley , whatnot but you are here .
i am more comfortable around my people .
let s jump right into it . your show has sparked a world of controversy , provoked a tone of dialogue . how do you see all of this ?
money and nothing else ?
money makes the world go round . it ai not no joke being poor . i know whati amtalkingabout . y knowwhati amsaying ? i have lived on the street . i have been homeless . i have learned how to play the game , work the game , be in the game .
is it inevitable that the game plays you ?
no if you go with the flow , tavis . that is what a lot of negroes do not understand . protesting is not gonna do a damn thing . if people do not like our satire in our number one hit show then do not watch it . or better yet write your own show . do it better .
do not you feel that is a simplistic retort ?
i do not know what a retort is , but it is simple . mantan the new millennium minstrel show is universal . it is not just for negroes in compton or th in harlem . this is america . our ancestors helped build this country , we got a right , just like everybody else . i am not gonna box myself in . this show makes people think , and they are laughing at the same time .
this is my best friend sleep n eat .
we both left the hustle and bustle of uptown , harlem . . .
. . . the big apple , new york , new york .
to come back to our roots .
our alabamy home . now we are getting countrified . we is bama s .
no mo city slickers . ahh , cannot you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton ?
tell em what you mean mistuh mantan .
well , thank you mistuh sleep n eat .
cousins , i want all of you to go to your windows . go to your windows and yell . yell , i am tired of the drugs , the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents . i am tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks . i am tired , you are tired , we are all tired of these so called bible thumping god fearing , whore mongling professional athletes . are not you tired of these basketball dunking , football running , hop hip rapping ebonic speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different ho s ? i know i am and so is sleep n eat .
you telling the truth .
y know my lady lucindy ?
the one with da big . . .
not her , the one with the little . . .
oh her .

too bad . how about a dress ?
sleep n eat , one of dem slinky , sexy , little foxy . . .
mantan , way too short , too tight . get her one of dose . . .

. . . too early . . .
. . . then what about . . .
. . . too late , maybe around . . .
. . . perfect . . .
that is what i like about you and me . we git along . . .
. . . like macaroni and cheese . . .
. . . like grits and butter . . .

good day to you , young sir .
good morning .
where are you bound for ?
that is none of your business .
is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel ?
and , i will tell you what , mr . dugan , i have been insulted grossly in this house . i ai not at all satisfied with these here ways of going on . i am an englishman , i am , and a man of property and i i
both of us ride home with best here .
i am not afraid of highwaymen . my man is armed , and so am i .
there s nothing else for it . take your ground , grogan twelve paces , i suppose ?
ten , sir , and make them short ones , do you hear , captain grogan ?
hoity toity ! john best , that is the matter here ?
i will tell you what it is , mr . dugan . i have had enough of miss dugan here and your irish ways . i ai not used to em , sir .
well , well ! what is it ? we will make you used to our ways , or adopt english ones .
it is not the english way , for ladies to have two lovers , and , so , mr . dugan , i will thank you to pay me the sum you owe me , and i resign all claims to this young lady . if she has a fancy for school boys , let her take em , sir .
pooh ! pooh ! best , you are joking .
my companion treated me with great civility , and asked me a thousand questions about england , which i answered as best i might . but this best , i am bound to say , was bad enough . i knew nothing about england , and i invented a thousand stories which i told him described the king and the ministers to him , said the british ambassador in berlin was my uncle , and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him .
what is your uncle s name ?
o grady .
this is a very good inn . shall we stop for dinner ?
this may be a very good inn for germany , but it would not pass in old ireland . corbach is only a league off , let us push on for corbach .
ah ! you sly rogue , i see that will influence you .
the place seems more a farm than an inn yard .
where is the beauty you promised me ?
upon my word , sir , i think you have acted very coolly .
i have acted as i think fit .
sir , i am a british officer .
it is a lie ! you are a deserter ! you are an impostor , sir your lies and folly have confirmed this to me . you pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you do not know . will you join and take the bounty , sir , or will you be given up ?
good morning , private james . please come in . i should like you to meet my uncle , herr minister of police galgenstein .
the captain was the nephew and heir of the minister of police , herr galgenstein , a relationship which , no doubt , aided in the younger gentlemengs promotion .
your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us if you succeed , depend on it , your reward will be your discharge from the army , and a bounty of guineas .
what is the service , sir ?
you are a hungarian you served in the army , and left on account of weakness in the loins . he gambles a great deal , and wins . do you know the cards well ?
only a very little , as soldiers do .
what are the chevalier s intentions ?
has he sent the challenge yet ?
you say he drives after breakfast and before dinner . when he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box , and the coachman will get his orders to move on .
and his baggage ?
this is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family .
dorothy might love me or not , as she likes , but best will have to fight me before he marries her !
a pretty day s work of it you have made , master roderick . knowing your uncle to be distressed for money , and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a year into the family ? best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so . he takes a girl without a penny a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past , and missing them all , and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father .
and so i am .
and this is the return you make for his kindness ! did not he harbor you in his house when your father died , and has not he given you and your mother , rent free , your fine house of jamesville yonder ?
mark this , come what will of it , i swear i will fight the man who pretends to the hand of dorothy dugan . i will follow him if it is into the church , and meet him there . i will have his blood , or he shall have mine . will you take my message to him , and arrange the meeting ?
well , if it must be , it must . for a young fellow , you are the most bloodthirsty i ever saw . no officer , bearing his majesty s commission , can receive a glass of wine on his nose , without resenting it fight you must , and best is a huge , strong fellow .
he will give the better mark . i am not afraid of him .
have you taken my message to him ?
the meeting is arranged . captain best is waiting for you now .
my mare is saddled and ready who s the captaings second ?
that is a very handsome sword you have there .
it was with this sword that my late father , harry james , god rest his soul , met sir huddelstone fuddelstone , the hampshire baronet , and was fatally run through the neck . he was quite in the wrong , having insulted lady fuddelstone , when in liquor , at the brentford assembly . but , like a gentleman , he scorned to apologize .
and now you risk the same fate . if you are killed , your mother is all alone in the world .
i hope to spoil this sport , and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully s body .
oh , it is with pistols we fight . you are no match for best with the sword .
i will match any man with the sword .
but swords are today impossible captain best is is lame . he knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night , as he was riding home , and can scarce move it now .
not against castle dugan gate , that has been off the hinges these ten years .
look here , roderick , my boy this is silly business . the girl will marry best , mark my words and as sure as she does , you will forget her . you are but a boy . best is willing to consider you as such . dublings a fine place , and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month , here are twenty guineas at your service . make best an apology , and be off .
grogan gave me a wink of recognition , but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters , and then , shaking hands with me cordially , gave me news which i wanted , of my family .
i had news of you in dublin . faith , you have begun early , like your father s son , but i think you could not do better than as you have done . but why did you not write home to your poor mother ? she has sent half a dozen letters to you in dublin .
i suppose she addressed them to me in my real name , by which i never thought to ask for them at the post office .
i see you are thinking of a certain young lady at duganstown .
is miss dugan well ?
there s only six miss dugans now . . . poor dorothy .
good heavens ! whatever ? has she died of grief ?
she took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband . she is now mrs . john best .
mrs . john best ! was there another mr . john best ? !
no , the very same one , my boy . he recovered from his wound . the ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him . it was only made of tow . do you think the dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a year out of the family ? the plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way , for the cowardly englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you . but hit him you certainly did , roderick , and with a fine thick plugget of tow , and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to . we told your mother the story afterwards , and a pretty scene she made .
the coward !
mr . o higgins , i cannot say how grateful i am for your timely assistance to my wife .
i am only sorry that i was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship s money and pearls .
mr . o higgins , we are in your debt , and rest assured , sir , you have friends in this house whenever you are in dublin . mister o higgins , i wonder if i know your good father ?
which o higgins do you know ? for i have never heard your name mentioned in my family .
oh , i am thinking of the o higgins of redmondstown . general o higgins was a close friend of my wife s dear father , colonel granby somerset .
ah i see . no , i am afraid mine are the o higgins of watertown .
whom have i been harboring in my house ? who are you , sirrah ?
sirrah ! sirrah , i am as good a gentleman as any in ireland !
you are an impostor , young man , a schemer , a deceiver !
repeat the words again , and i run you through the body .
chevalier , though i cannot say how , i believe you have cheated me .
i deny your grace s accusations , and beg you to say how you have been cheated ?
i do not know .
your grace owes me seventy thousand frederics , which i have honorably won .
chevalier , if you will have your money now , you must fight for it . if you will be patient , maybe i will pay you something another time .
your grace , if i am so tame as to take this , then i must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation .
where is my rascal , lazlo ?
good gracious ! what is this ?
you are going to drive to the frontier .
it is shameful infamous ! i insist upon being put down at the austrian ambassador s house .
i have orders to gag your honor if you cry out , and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not .
ten thousand ? but the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand .
your honor must lower his voice .
all europe shall hear of this !
i have no luggage .
you are the young man who m . de seebach recommended ?
your name is lazlo zilagyi ?
yes , sir .
you come highly recommended by herr seebach .
herr seebach was a very kind employer .
for whom else have you worked ?
no one , sir . before that i served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins .
who else can give me information about you ?
and i think he was as much affected as i was at thus finding one of his kindred for he , too , was an exile from home , and a friendly voice , a look , brought the old country back to his memory again , and the old days of his boyhood .
the cards are now my only livelihood . sometimes i am in luck , and then i lay out my money in these trinkets you see . it is property , look you , and the only way i have found of keeping a little about me . when the luck goes against me , why , my dear , my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and i wear paste . do you understand the cards ?
i can play as soldiers do , but have no great skill .
but they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost .
have no fear . it will come out well for me .
i believe they will deport you .
i have faced that problem before .
but , if they send you away , then what is to become of me ?
make your mind easy , you shall not be left behind , i warrant you . do take a last look at your barracks , make your mind easy , say a farewell to your friends in berlin . the dear souls , how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country , and , out of it , you shall go .
gentlemen , i wish you a good day . will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning , and tell my man there to send my baggage on to three kings at dresden ?
when the duke of courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins , and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags , what did we ask ?
it is distasteful to kill a scoundrel that should be work for a hangman .
to risk one s life against such people is an imposition .
i risk nothing , for i am certain to kill him .
certain ?
i entered here , monsieur , at a bad moment for you it seems that you love this lady .
certainly , monseigneur , does not your excellency consider her worthy of love ?
perfectly so and what is more , i will tell you that i love her , and that i am not of a humor to put up with rivals .
very well ! now that i know it , i will no longer love her .
then you yield to me .
on the instant . everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you .
very well but a man who yields takes to his legs .
that is a trifle strong .
no .
have you had one ?
never .
but , for a time . . . a passing fancy ?
not even that .
how can i believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you ?
not one .
have you not a man whom you value ?
that man has , perhaps , not yet been born .
what ! you have not met a man worthy of your attention ?
many worthy of attention but valuing is something more . i could value only someone whom i loved .
then you have never loved ? your heart is empty .
your word empty makes me laugh . is it fortunate , or unfortunate ? if it is fortunate , i congratulate myself . if it is unfortunate , i do not care , for i am not aware of it .
it is nonetheless a misfortune , and you will know it when you love .
but if , when i love , i am unhappy , i will know that my empty heart was my good fortune .
that is true , but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love .
it is only too possible . love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult , and it is even more difficult to make it last .
i agree but god put us on earth to take that risk .
a man may need to do that , and find it amusing but a girl is bound by other laws .
i believe you , and i see i must hasten to leave , for otherwise i shall become the unhappiest of men .
how so ?
you want my heart ?
it is my only object .
to make me wretched in two weeks .
to love you until death . to subscribe to all your commands .
the amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing , if it is true that you love me .
deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me . if i do not know it , i am innocent .
be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are ?
and if she does not choose to show you some kindness ?
then i will respectfully take leave of her .
you will do as you please . it seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other . do you not agree ?
yes but i am afraid of being deceived .
poor man . and , for that reason , you want to begin where people end ?
will we always leave it at this ?
always , my dear one , never any further . love is a child to be pacified with trifles . a full diet can only kill it .
i know better than you do . love wants a more substantial fare , and if it is stubbornly withheld , it withers away .
our abstinence makes our love immortal . if i loved you a quarter of an hour ago , now i should love you even more . but i should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires .
let us give each other complete happiness , and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires , they will each time be born anew .
my husband has convinced me of the contrary .
shall i tell you something i believed what was called love came after the union and i was surprised when my husband , making me a woman , made me know it only by pain , unaccompanied by any pleasure . i saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead . and so we became only friends , seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other , yet on good terms for a while , as whenever he wanted me , i was at his service , but since the offering was not seasoned with love , he found it tasteless , and seldom demanded it .
without you , my dearest , i might have died without ever knowing love . inexpressible love ! god of nature ! bitterness than which nothing is sweeter , sweetness than which nothing is more bitter . divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes .
let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that i am happy .
as soon as i saw you loved me , i was pleased , and i gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me , being certain that , for my part , i would never love you . but after our first kiss , i found that i had no power over myself . i did not know that one kiss could matter so much .
my lady cosgrove s relationship with me was a singular one . her life was passed in a series of crack brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me . we would quarrel for a fortnight , then we should be friends for a month together sometimes . one day , i was joking her , and asking her whether she would take the water again , whether she had found another lover , and so forth . she suddenly burst out into tears , and , after a while , said to me
lady cosgrove , you are an old fool .
i accept , but i insist on a wager . the loser must do whatever the winner pleases .
agreed .
i feel the ribbon .
why are you shaking ?
i hate miss clancy , you know i do ! and i only danced with her because because the person with whom i intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night .
i had not been in the room five minutes before i was engaged for every single set .
were you obliged to dance five times with captain best , and then stroll out with him into the garden ?
i do not care a fig for captain best he dances prettily to be sure , and is a pleasant rattle of a man . he looks well in his regimentals , too and if he chose to ask me to dance , how could i refuse him ?
but you refused me , dorothy .
oh ! i can dance with you any day , and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner . besides , roderick , captain best s a man , and you are only a boy , and you have not a guinea in the world .
if ever i meet him again , you shall see which is the best man of the two . i will fight him with sword or with pistol , captain as he is .
suppose , now , roderick , you , who are such a hero , was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side .
i would draw my sword , and cut my way through them .
what , with me on the pillion ? would you kill poor me ?
well , then , i will tell you what i would do . i would jump daisy into the river , and swim you both across , where no enemy could follow us .
monster ! your father was a tailor , and you are always thinking of the shop . but i will have my revenge , i will ! roddy , will you see me insulted ?
i am at your service , mr . cosgrove . how much do you wish to spend ?
as much as possible .
as much as possible ?
yes , for i wish to entertain splendidly .
all the same , you must name an amount .
last month , the duke of suffolk spent no more .
and , to be sure , i did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done , and this was the distinguished solicitor and former government minister , lord west , whose acquaintance i made , as i had so many others , at the gaming table .
do you happen to know gustavus adolphus , the thirteenth earl of crabs ?
by name only .
have you done , mr . cosgrove ?
yes !
does this assignment interest you ?
was he cheated ?
in so far as i can tell these things no . i believe the chevalier won the money fairly .
a meeting with the prince of turbingen is impossible .
the king has determined to send the chevalier out of the country .
then this must be done tomorrow .
what has happened , madam , to annoy your ladyship ?
be off to your work , you pack of rascals , or you will have a good taste of my thong . have you lost much ?
that fool did not know what was the meaning of a hundred pound bill , which was in the pocket book that the fellow took from me .
i am riding to dublin myself , and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you , i shall do my best to protect you from further mishap .
but i should not like to put you to such trouble , mister . . . ?
as you have been robbed of your purse , may i have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home ?
how different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at kilwangan assemblies . in every sentence , she mentioned a lord or a person of quality . to the lady s question about my birth and parentage , i replied that i was a young gentleman of large fortune , that i was going to dublin for my studies , and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum .
i have good news for you , mr . cosgrove . the firm of bracegirdle and chatwick , in the city of london , are prepared to lend you , pounds , pledged against your interest in the edric mines . they will redeem the encumbrances against the property , which amount to some , pounds , and take a twenty year working lease on the mines . they will lend you the , pounds against the lease income , which they will apply to the loan as it comes in , and they will make a charge of per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance .
mr . newcombe , i have made some difficult loans during the past few years , at very onerous terms , but a year interest seems very stiff indeed .
considering your financial circumstances , mr . cosgrove , it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you . i think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity . but , obviously , if you would reject this offer , i shall keep trying to find a better one .
i am prepared to accept the terms , mr . newcombe .
there are a few other points we should discuss . the loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship s signature , and provided that bracegirdle and chatwick can be assured of her ladyship s freewill in giving her signature .
provided that they can be assured of her ladyship s freewill ? are you serious ?
may i be quite frank with you ?
yes , of course .
mister bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life , and meditated a separation , in which case , she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance , and subject them , at any rate , to a doubtful and expensive litigation . they were quite insistent on this point , and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship s perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital .
i see .
did you buy the horse , papa ?
now , just have a little patience , my boy . your birthday is not until next week .
but i will have it on my birthday , will not i ?
good night , papa .
good night , my little darling .
papa ?
yes ?
one of the boys in the stable told nelly that you have already bought my horse , and that it is at doolangs farm , where mick the groom is breaking it in . is that true , papa ?
i promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to doolangs farm to see him .
your bother is in america fighting the rebels .
is he all right , papa ?
yes , he is fine .
i made sir william cosgrove s acquaintance as usual at the play table . one could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime for , though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases , a cripple wheeled about in a chair , and suffering pangs of agony , yet you would see him every morning , and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth .
indeed , you are right , sir . look at me . marriage has added forty years to my life . i am dying , a worn out cripple , at the age of fifty . when i took off lady cosgrove , there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself . fool that i was ! i had enough with my pensions , perfect freedom , the best society in europe and i gave up all these , and married and was miserable . take a warning from me , mr . roderick , and stick to the trumps . do anything , but marry .
would you have me spend my life all alone ?
in truth , sir , yes , but , if you must marry , then marry a virtuous drudge .
the milkmaid s daughter ?
sir william cosgrove , with his complication of ills , was dying before us by inches . he was continually tinkered up by doctors , and , what with my usual luck , he might be restored to health and live i do not know how many years . if cosgrove would not die , where was the use of my pursing his lady ? but my fears were to prove groundless , for on that very night , patient nature would claim her account .
good evening , mr . james , have you done with my lady ?
i beg your pardon ?
come , come , sir . i am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool .
gentlemen , see this amiable youth ! he has been troubled by religious scruples , and has flown for refuge to my chaplin , mr . hunt , who has asked for advise from my wife , lady cosgrove , and between them both , they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith . did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple ?
faith , sir , if i want to learn good principles , it is surely better i should apply for them to your lady , and your chaplin than to you ?
well , if my intentions are what you think they are if i do wish to step into your shoes , what then ? i have no other intentions than you had yourself . lady cosgrove s wealth may be great , but am i not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily ? her rank is lofty , but not so lofty as my ambition . i will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my lady cosgrove as you ever showed her and if i win her , and wear her when you are dead and gone , corbleu , knight , do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me ?
is it not a pleasure , gentlemen , for me , as i am drawing near the goal , to find my home such a happy one my wife so fond of me , that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor ? is not it a comfort to see her like a prudent housewife , getting everything ready for her husband s departure ?
i hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon , knight ?
not so soon , my dear , as you may fancy perhaps . why , man , i have been given over many times these four years , and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation . who knows how long i may keep you waiting .
sir , let those laugh that win .
charming schuvaloff .
black eyed sczortarska .
dark valdez .
do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight ?
yes . he brought me in his carriage , and he will call for me at midnight .
and he does not care about me ?
he is only curious to know who you are .
if his love were like mine , he would not permit you to come here .
he loves me , as i love you .
will he wish to know the details of this night ?
he will believe that it will please me if he asks about it , and i shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him .
do not like em , do not eat em , do not make no damn difference to me .
can i at least have a drink ?
it is ten thirty in the morning .
yeah , if you have slept .
you know the law no liquor before noon . could lose my license .

they would have killed us both . you want me to write a confession , i will write a confession .
you saved kendall s life
raymond , for you to have any chance of coming out of this , we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony . otherwise this is just another story
we are not finished yet
we do not need the tapes
oh , you do not ? what else do you have on me ? you have not found any bodies yet , have you ?
not true , cadet , i have got a gun
he he made me do it
do what ?
i guess nunez was not dead after all . he came after us with a vengeance . you know the rest .
and the bodies ?
i promised them i would ask you where west and the others are . . .
washout rejects , guys he said were dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead . . .
are you saying sergeant west tried to kill you ?
that first night with pike . i made the mistake of letting him sit down at around .
tell us about the other guys , the ones west weeded out .
he was sickly . had that shaking thing , whatd yacall it , epoxy ?
epilepsy .
he said he worked there
no , did he tell you about it ? about the business childs ran ?
what business ?
where ?
what about the phosphorous grenade ?
back up .
mueller was alone in the cabin ?
why did not you tell us all this in the first place ?
where is the cabin ?
you kept kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end . you even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him , too .
is that what i did , now ? and of course , you can prove all of it .
we can prove that you are not ray dunbar . impersonating a fellow cadet is a court martial in and of itself
ohhhh , i do not think so . . .
how do you know that ?
cadet , that is your name !
sir , dunbar , sir !
you know how to work a pistol , dunbar ?
dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty four hours ! he is not to be given food , water , or clothes ! if he so much as moves , you are to blow his nigger brains out , is that clear ?
sir , yes , sir !
what the fuck is going on ?
he would not kill anybody . . .
oh , bullshit , he is a fucking convict . you know how much he hated west
shut up . let me see your grenades .
why ?
jesus , what happened ?
pike and i got separated . . . then i heard gunfire . close .
so you killed him ?
whose blood is that , jay ?
what do you mean , west s ?
where have you been , jay ?
roberto , what the fuck ?
we just want to check your pack
you know it is not like that
right ?
you gotta untie me . i did not do this thing , ray .
you hated west more than any of us .
maybe , but that do not make me a killer
you are the only one missing a grenade .
ray , this is my life here . i ai not gonna pretend i am not happy west is gone , but you know i could not have done this . it is not in me .
if not you , then who ?
mueller .
oh , come on
we are sweeping our area and suddenly he is gone . couple minutes later , phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away
that is exactly what he says about you .
you hated west , mueller loved him
enough to go to prison ? childs px scam , mueller was in on it
bullshit .
look in my pack .
why ?
combat grade morphine . mueller sold it to me .
you are lying
why . . . why did not you tell me ?
that still does not mean you did not kill him .
you saw west , right ? how was he killed ?
full clip to the body
from up close or far away ?
his chest was hamburger
way i figure it , west must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them , so they decided to get rid of him first . . .
they ?
i . . . i do not know . . .
what do not you know ?
there s no time to think , ray , we gotta get out of here ! you untie me , we grab the guns , get kendall and nunez , and make a run for it
no . . . no , we can just wait till we get back and then tell the m . p . s
a test will no doubt link you to the killing
you . . . i have seen you around the base . but you . . . you are not army , are you ?
that is it . you are that policeman with friends in low places . tell me , how is guissepe torres doing these days ? those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer
i have done nothing wrong . i am the victim here .
but not the only victim , right ?
my father is a powerful man . over the years he is used that power to protect me , in one form or another , from certain . . . unpleasantries . i am a homosexual .
senator daddy must be thrilled .
he is not , shall we say , wild about the idea . he has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities , and i have done my best to oblige him . however , in the last four weeks , i began a relationship with another cadet . what do you think of that ?
i think you just blew do not ask , do not tell out of the fucking water .
levi , i do not know if you are familiar with investigative work , but we have this little thing called motive and you just gave yourself one .
you said you wanted to know what happened i am telling you the truth .
what happened to degrees ?
i did not kill him
maybe i should not tell you that . maybe i should tell you i was not scared at all . but i was . . . enough to almost kill him .
but you did not .
he admitted it .
why did he come back for you ?
okay . i think that is it . he rises and walks to the door .
somebody emptied a full clip into him
you tried to pin three stone murders on dunbar
how many murders did you cover up ? one ? five ? maybe an even ten .
epileptic attacks are murder on your system . rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer .
is it the truth ?
why did you tell us he shot everybody , levi ? you put him in for three murders , the man saved your life
so i should stay silent about his misdeeds ? the guns went off , i ran in , childs shot me , pike and mueller were dead , and dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun
dunbar was running out the door ? ohhhhhh . . . see that is where i was confused , because i thought you said nunez was running out the door .
no . i said dunbar .
i believe your next line is what are you trying to hide ?
well ?
dunbar will testify that you were .
something funny , levi ?
jail if he is lucky , the gas chamber if he is not
why ?
how do you know ?
or you , levi ? when is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him ?
i did not
you lied to us , levi , you are going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them !
i do not know
where are they !
maybe
maybe what
how are you ?
been better . i read about that is been happening with you . . . i should have called
that bad ?
would i have called you if it was not ? if there was any other way
this is warrant officer julia osborne , the closest thing we have to an in house investigator .
the official term for it is clusterfuck . by the time beth hit us , i would canceled all off base exercises save one a six man cadet team and their drill out in the bush . we are missing three and the sergeant . the cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle , nobody here knows much about them , up to and including their names . but the sergeant . . .
a few years ago , the army picked our good buddy as their go to non com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder , gentler military . he even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming basic cadets across the country .
the exercise was one of his section eight private sessions . left around yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at this morning .
and the problem is you only got three .
no , the problem is one s dead , one s got a bullet in his arm , and one will not talk . the one who will not talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick up .
i am assuming that is what made him the dead one ?
which gives us about five hours . why would you call me ?
the guy in interrogation said he would only talk to a cop .
tom , bottom line i let those kids go out there . if jag shows up and i do not have any answers for them , my career is finished
he is not done by a longshot , i can get more out of him
pike killed west , dunbar killed mueller , childs , and nunez .
who killed pike ?
we have already been over the terrain twice . nothing .
there was a hurricane , bill , the wind probably moved it .
habeas corpus you have to have a body to have a crime .
okay , then let s widen the search to include the endzone in giants stadium and the trunk of my car
without the body we have no physical proof . we need a confession .
from dunbar ? i hate to break this to you , but i do not think he is gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty .
nevertheless
nevertheless what ? kendall will testify and that will be enough .
you mean not enough to save you .
tom , where are you going
home , i am done .
you want a confession ? why do not you confess , bill people are dead and you do not give a shit about it ! only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job , you know this is your fault
what the hell are you talking about
what i said before
was dead right . you think dunbar s on the level ?
yeah .
it is over . time of death was . jag s been notified and i called the senator myself . my report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable . . . you two had no culpability in the matter .
that is horseshit and you know it .
you think you could explain all this to me ?
they are taking your command , are not they ?
i am sorry , bill .
do not be . i am not cut out to deal with the west s of the world .
you are a good soldier , bill .
it was so good , i actually forgot you are one of the bigger dogs now . the base commander . the one in control . you could not let him testify , could you ?
what are you talking about ?
if you let him testify then it would have all come out . west was supposed to take care of it out there , shut nunez up and then disappear . but it got messy and people got killed . so you called your old pal tom hardy , figuring if worse came to worse , he would cover for you .
you are drunk
stay where you are .
or what ? you have gone round the bend
what i cannot understand is why you signed these . if you would just let west take care of the paperwork , no one would have known , but you got careless . so when pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him , too .
that is preposterous
toxicology report came back . kendall s attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine , maybe you have heard of it . it is for asthmatics . if an epileptic takes enough , it kills them . i checked with the nurses at the hospital you are the only other person who visited kendall .
i wanted to see if he was okay
you poisoned him , bill . you heard our interrogation , you knew he was ready to crack , so you killed him , just like pike .
i am not even going to dignify that
no ! you will stand there and you will listen ! what happened to you , bill ? you were the one who joined up to do good in the world . you were the one who believed in it
you want to get into a finger pointing contest about character ? the army kicked you out for drugs , the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster , and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct ? there s only one criminal standing in this room and it is you .
no more witnesses . west s a ghost . but it does not matter because we have your signature , the hospital log , and kendall s toxicology report . and that will be enough .
you are crazy
you cannot duck this , bill . i may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but i will not let this happen .
for the last time , i have no idea what you are talking about
hostile and uncooperative .
ah , christ
you knew sergeant west ?
i did not mean that as a compliment .
sergeant west s served for twenty three years . he is the public face of the modern army .
gotta be honest , i love what you have done with the place
you and the colonel go back .
he got me through basic and a lot of other stuff . i owe him .
you are the tom hardy i have been reading about in the papers , right ? new orleans pd fired you for taking bribes from guissepe torres .
it was for suspicion of bribery , it is really all in the wording
wording and your friendship with the colonel aside , i am not comfortable having you involved in this .
three things . first you do not have a choice . second i have never taken a bribe in my life . and third i am still a little drunk from last night , so if i skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you , try not to take offense . tell me about the two guys .
hurricane knocked out our mainframe , so all we have are their dogtags . cadets raymond dunbar and levi kendall
levi ? who names their kid levi
senator jonathan kendall , of ohio .
christ . . . remind me to thank bill for mentioning that on the phone
kendall junior is still in surgery , so he will not be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour the cadet we are talking to first is dunbar .
he is in interrogation ?
yes .
move him .
why ?
because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms , which does not exactly put people at ease . is he cute ?
excuse me ?
is dunbar cute ?
that is the most unprofessional
thank you . at some point in there i am gonna rub my nose . when i do , go at him with everything you got .
good cop bad cop ?
i questioned him for three hours and he did not make a sound . you do not have a badge , he will not talk to you .
the colonel saw you shoot nunez , you are a murderer
baseball ?
i believe somebody owes me ten dollars
you made me look like an idiot
you really want to make banal chit chat like that now ?
you are right . we should sit in silence .
we are in the middle of a murder case
what is that ?
typical army brat story . dad was noncom , mom was a nurse . there was never any real doubt of joining up .
you had a mobile of bayonets above your crib .
something like that . you ?
you are kidding .
this is the straight hitting on me you were talking about , is not it ?
the very same .
you do understand that there s absolutely no way i could ever be attracted to you , right ?
i plan to grow on you .
you are off to a late start .
you guys really got the shit kicked out of you here .
imagine what it must have been like for them out there . what do you think of dunbar ?
he is telling the truth , up to a point .
something wrong ?
being back here . gives me the willies .
remember , he is the son of a senator , so go easy . kid gloves .
that was kid gloves ?
but we have to question him thought you did not have cigarettes
too neat . how long have you been an investigator ?
i do not think that has anything to do with
i just . . . he came back for kendall . i do not think he is capable of murder .
look , all we have got is what kendall says , and he did not actually witness any deaths except nunez . he found west , he saw mueller and pike , but just their bodies he did not see any crime committed .
why the fuck was not he in restraints ?
styles could not reassign him , he is a legend
goddammit , hardy , you cannot just leave
watch me .
west was a monster ! fifteen years ago , i was here , i was section eight , i was pike . fuck being the knife dummy that thing he did , stripping pike down , making him stand outside all night ? he did that every year , he did that to me . fifteen years ago , i wanted him dead , and now i am supposed to care that somebody offed him ? sorry , no can do . i tried .
you did more than try . you cracked dunbar in less than three minutes , as an investigator you are phenomenal
i was starting to believe you , you know ? that you were not who everyone said . i guess i was wrong
oh , spare me the reverse psychology bullshit ! this is not my great second chance , osborne . everyone thinks i am a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that . nobody will ever know what happens here
why do you care ?
i did not shoot west . . .
what ?
at least you and kendall agree on that .
talk it through childs , mueller , and nunez know they are going out on the regular tuesday night drill , hurricane or no hurricane , so they plan it kill west , pin it on pike .
and they are smart about it . they know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated , you need a fall guy and for that to work , you have to have a witness .
dunbar .
exactly , someone who s not involved , who s word cannot be questioned . you only let them see what you want them to see , you make them believe , so when the time comes , they have totally bought into your version of events .
they believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent .
and if they are asked , that is what they will tell the , world .
so it is a good plan but it goes wrong mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy , which means they have to bring dunbar and kendall into the cover story
kendall maybe would have agreed , but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin
buttfucks the cabin ?
and all hell breaks loose . a lot of good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz , bang , zoom , happy ending .
so why , after dunbar drags kendall out from under a house , does the senator s son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber ?
that bugs you too ?
little bit .
we are fucked , i know
they got their stories straight .
what ?
what kendall said the type of guys you do not feel comfortable going to sleep around . that is what dunbar said about childs to the letter .
are you sure ?
why do not you talk to levi off the record for a second ?
that is a fantastic idea
i pushed him too hard .
you could not have known
yeah , i could have . should have .
you wanted to get the truth .
no , i did not . i wanted to humiliate him . for what he did to dunbar . for fucking over the little guy .
you wanted to break him .
yeah .
so what now ?
now i go home , get drunk , and try and forget this ever happened .
think it will work ?
you know , you never told me why you left the army .
it dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority . . . and all i did here was follow orders . it did not add up . plus , i got kicked out .
for what ?
we were close to something with kendall .
maybe . . . maybe we were nowhere near . sometimes mysteries stay mysteries . i have not by any chance grown on you , have i ?
no .
four
we got maybe three minutes till they break it down .
hardy , what are you doing
we can tie you to the chair if it will work better for you
hardy , for chrissakes
no bodies , no west . . .
we need to talk
what ?
this is not the time
this is the perfect time . you know what makes a good detective ? the number of confessions they get . you are a good detective , osborne . so now you get mine .
what if i do not want it ?
that is not true .
there are degrees of truth , officer . always degrees .
you are a good man , hardy .
really .
west ?
do i have a choice in this ?
what are you doing out here ?
leaving without saying goodbye . what are you gonna do ?
go home , get drunk , and try and forget this ever happened .
think it will work ?
nah .
a word of advice about women that first hour or so after they kill their boss ? probably not the best time to hit on them .
i should probably write that down .
your phone number ?
he was your friend .
the thing is , we have got a real opportunity here . you turn me in tomorrow and we are both fucked
what are you talking about ?
how ?
mueller . he is as bad as west and we both know it . now i cannot do it , cause i am tied up , but we get the others to go along
i do not think i want to hear this
pike , please
maybe we should not go .
the faggot speaks .
you ever been in a hurricane , mueller ?
we should tell him we are not going .
they found him . poor fucker was practically blown in half
poor fucker my ass . . .
pike and i got separated
yeah and he does not know when
i remember now , it was before the explosion
oh , you remember now
i was freezing from the hurricane
so you took off your shirt ?
we just want
he could not kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own .
he said what ?
you are gonna die tonight , faggot . clear as day .
no one else heard it ?
nunez was chasing dunbar .
because he would shot mueller .
but you did not see it , right ?
pike never confessed .
running out of time , are we ? tick tock , tick tock , how long till your witnesses fly the coop ?
fifty minutes .
pike never confessed .
dunbar says you were .
you and dunbar got your stories straight . little details , little inconsistencies , designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other , asking questions , killing time , until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where senator daddy can protect you . you think you are just going to slide out of this ? you are an accessory to murder , levi , you are going to jail
it does not matter , levi . we are going to find those bodies and when we do , i am going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon
it will not work
enjoy your flight to washington
wait
dunbar s telling the truth .
wrong answer
who , levi
i told him what had really happened to west . told him to keep quiet about it or i would destroy him . because if it came out that i was involved with the whole px scam , my father would be finished .
i scared dunbar into silence . he is been trying to cover for me the whole time . we got here , you came to see me . . . i did not know if i could trust him with that kind of secret
what happened with nunez ?
hurricane s due after midnight and we are still going out ?
what the fuck happened to you
whoever shot the sarge blew a grenade first
thank god . . .
this place is going , mueller . we gotta move
we all know what you did , pike . i do not know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here , but
where is your shirt , mueller ?
i used it to start the fire
goddammit , ray , we gotta get out of here
cadet michael mueller , i hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of sergeant nathan west
the fuck are you talking about
you are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard
bullshit
until we return to base , and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in sergeant west s body
tell him to shut up
sign here and here . hey , ai not you the folks working on that whole hulabaloo from last night ?
yeah .
funny . i swear i saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning .
no , no that was cadet dunbar
so ?
this is totally unnecessary
he asked to see a policeman , we are getting him a policeman .
but this guy you called , he is not even army
he is former army and the best i have ever seen in a room . besides , he knows the territory , we did basic together here . you have had three hours with dunbar and have not gotten a peep , we need to take a different tack .
he is not army , it is not official
search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup . if they are hurt and we can get to them in time . . .
you think he did it ?
what do you think ?
you want kendall , do not you ?
you both know if you do this , if you go after a senator s son and you are wrong . . . it is not just me in the hot seat anymore .
we know .
what happens to dunbar now ?
you never told me why you got kicked out of . . .
you motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives ! you have chosen to join my army ! this army is my mother , my father , and my little virgin sister and i will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze , do you understand me give me a sir , yes , sir !
sir , yes , sir !
those who i deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit , and those who refuse to quit i will kill . you ever hear of a training accident give me a sir , yes , sir !
sir , yes , sir !
in my time i have killed sixteen men for the good of my country , sixteen men whose entrance into this army i could not condone , as it would weaken the fabric of this nationgs defense ! this base suffers an average of three training accidents a year , unfortunate incidents that i will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me , understand give me a sir , yes , sir !
sir , yes , sir !
some of you may have heard there s a hurricane coming ! american soldiers do not wait for good weather they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty ! an american soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy ! anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh , feel free to lay down and die , you get me ?
sir , yes , sir !
great , great . that is fantastic .
hey kid ! your friend just made himself a star .
see ! the big guy likes it .
i just saw the woman i am going to marry , i know it . but then i lost her .
tough break . most men have to get married before they lose their wives .
i am going to spend the rest of my life looking for her . that or die alone .
jesus , kid . let me guess . real pretty , blonde hair , blue hat ?
yes !
i know her uncle . friends of the family .
who is she ? where does she live ?
what do you mean ? you do not even know me .
sure i do . you were hot shit back in hickville , but here in the real world , you got squat . you do not have a plan . you do not have a job . you do not have anything but the clothes on your back .
someone stole my backpack .
i do not have a job , but i would have a job if you gave me one . and i may not have much , but i have more determination than any man you are ever going to meet .
sorry , kid . i do not do charity .
did not kill anything , did i ?
a few rabbits , but i think one of them was already dead .
i was wrong about you kid . you may not have much , but what you got , you got a lot of . you could get any girl .
her name is sandra templeton . she is going to auburn . the semester s almost over , so you better hurry .
thank you .
welcome to ya . that is your name ?
bloom like a flower ?
yes .
you were expecting me ?
what is this place ?
the town of spectre . best kept secret in alabama . says here you are from ashton , right ? last person we had from ashton was norther winslow .
the poet ? what ever happened to him ?
he is still here . let me buy you a drink . i will tell you all about it . hell , i will have him tell you .
now tell me if that is not the best pie you ever ate .
i have to leave . tonight .
why ?
this town is everything a man could ask for . and if i were to end up here , i would consider myself lucky . but the fact is , i am not ready to end up anywhere .
you will not find a better place !
or are you too scared ?
i will go in right now and get that eye .
then do it .
fine , i will .
fine , you do it .
you get the eye ?
i brought it .
bloom !
don .
what the hell are you doing ? this is my girl . mine !
will .
dr . bennett . it is good to see you . my wife , josephine .
can i see him ?
glad to see you are not trying to have a heartfelt talk . it is one of my greatest annoyances , when people talk to those who cannot hear them .
how long have you known my father ?
thirty years . maybe more .
how would you describe him ?
did your father ever tell you about the day you were born ?
a thousand times . he caught an uncatchable fish .
not that one . the real story . did he ever tell you that ?
no .
did you see that woman ?
what did she look like ?
well , she . . . uh . . .
yeah .
how old are you ?
eighteen .
i am eight . that means when i am eighteen , you will be . and when i am , you will only be .
you are pretty good at arithmetic .
how are you gonna make it without your shoes ?
promise me you will come back .
you must be edward bloom .
no one would come out here unless they had business . and no one would have business with me except for you . you are buying the town .
apparently i have overlooked this one piece of it , and i would like to remedy that . you see , in order for the town to be preserved , the trust must own it in its entirety .
so i have heard .
in so many words , yes .
then i do not think so mr . bloom . if nothing is going to change , i would just as soon it not change in the way it has not been changing all this time .
helping people makes me happy .
i am not convinced you should be happy .
you are beamengs daughter . your last name is different . you married .
i will not be selling you this house , mr . bloom .
it is okay , just leave it .
lord , i am sorry i . . .
please . go . just go .
i will . . .
do not . do not be embarrassed . i should never have let you think that . . . i am in love with my wife .
i know .
and from the moment i saw her until the moment i die , she is the only one .
lucky girl .
really .
hi . how are you feeling ?
i was dreaming .
means when you dream about something that is going to happen . like one night , i had a dream where this crow came and told me , your aunt is going to die . i was so scared i woke up my parents . they told me it was just a dream , to go back to bed . but the next morning , my aunt stacy was dead .
that is terrible .
because see , my mother was banging the milkman .
no , i understand .
he was buttering her rolls . pumping her churn . splashing milk in her box .
stop .
spooning the sherbet .
can i take your picture ?
you do not need a picture . just look up handsome in the dictionary .
that is because we did not have a wedding . your mother in law was never supposed to marry me . she was engaged to somebody else .
i never knew .
will never told you that ? probably just as well . he would have told it all wrong anyway . all the facts and none of the flavor .
oh , so this is a tall tale ?
i thought you said you did not have a church wedding .
is it the medicine that is making you thirsty ?
there was one time when i was eleven . . .
you were talking about your wedding .
i did not forget . i was just working on a tangent . see , most men , they will tell a story straight through , and it will not be complicated , but it will not be interesting either .
i like your stories .
hardly two stories in the whole place . now i have heard in real cities , they have got buildings so tall you cannot even see the tops of em .
really ?
would not lie to you . and they have got all you can eat buffets . you can eat a lot , cannot you ?
i can .
you are just trying to get me to leave , are not you ? that is why they sent you here .
that is your name , giant ?
karl .
mine s edward . and truthfully , i do want you to leave , karl . but i want to leave with you . you think this town is too small for you , well , it is too small for a man of my ambition . i cannot see staying here a day longer .
you do not like it ?
okay .
what did she say ?
you know anyone s who s taken it ?
you are not trying to run away ?
you can see my predicament . my wedding ring , the symbol of fidelity to my wife , soon to be the mother of my child , was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish .
what , a father s not allowed to talk about his son ?
i am a footnote in that story . i am the context for your great adventure . which never happened ! incidentally ! you were selling novelty products in wichita the day i was born .
jesus christ .
friend of yours ? did you help him out of a bind ?
come on , will . everyone likes that story .
the one about the witch .
your mom says i cannot tell you that one anymore . you get nightmares .
you are in for a surprise .
am i ?
having a kid changes everything . i mean , there s the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings . . .
did you do any of that ?
no , but i hear it is terrible . then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child , fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine .
you think i am up for it ?
people need not worry so much . it is not my time yet . this is not how i go .
really .
truly . i saw it in the eye .
the old lady by the swamp .
she was a witch .
no , she was old and probably senile . maybe schizophrenic .
i saw my death in that eye . and this is not how it happens .
so how does it happen ?
there was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when i came out of this coffee shop near the office .
okay .
and every day i gave him a quarter . every day . then i got sick and was out for a couple of weeks . and when i went back there , you know what he said ?
what did he say ?
you owe me three fifty .
really .
when did you ever work in an office ?
there s a lot you do not know about me .
dad , i am hoping we can talk about some things while i am here .
you mean , while i am here .
your mother has not been keeping up the pool . if you wanted to you could . . .
i will .
you know where the chemicals are ?
i thought you were not dying .
why not religion , dad ?
josephine actually went to the congo last year .
did i ever tell you about how . . .
the maple tree and the buick . we heard it .
but the real story is how i got the car . you see . . .
dad ?
son ?
do you know much about icebergs , dad ?
do i ? i saw an iceberg once . they were hauling it down to texas for drinking water , only they did not count on an elephant being frozen inside . the woolly kind . a mammoth .
dad !
what ?
i am trying to make a metaphor here .
then you should not have started with a question . because people want to answer questions . you should have started with , the thing about icebergs is . . .
the thing about icebergs is you only see percent of them . the other percent is below the water where you cannot see it . and that is what it is with you dad . i am only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water .
what , you are seeing down to my nose ? my chin ?
i have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact .
i have told you a thousand facts . that is all i do , will . i tell stories .
you tell lies , dad . you tell amusing lies . stories are what you tell a five year old at bedtime . they are not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty . and the thing is , i believed you . i believed your stories so much longer than i should have . and then when i realized that everything you said was impossible everything ! i felt like such a fool to have trusted you . you were like santa claus and the easter bunny combined . just as charming and just as fake .
you think i am fake .
dad , i am about to have a kid of my own here . it would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me .
what do you want , will ? who do you want me to be ?
yourself . good , bad , everything . just show me who you are for once .
the river .
tell me how it happens .
how what happens ?
i can try , dad . if you help . just tell me how it starts .
like this .
let s get out of here .
where are we headed ?
you say . . .
it is unbelievable .
you become what you always were . a very big fish . and that is the way it happens .
i am sorry .
oh .
daffodils ?
they are your favorite flower .
how did you get so many ?
you do not even know me .
how can i convince you to stop ?
i was drying out .
wait ! i need those !
i have been working on this poem for years .
really .
this is why you do not show work in progress .
norther , do you ever regret not making it to paris ?
i cannot imagine any place better than here .
it is me . norther winslow .
i do not believe it !
i want you to know , when you left spectre it opened my eyes . there was a whole life out there that i was not living . so i travelled . i saw france , and africa , half of south america . every day a new adventure , that is my motto .
so what are you up to now ?
this is it ? the whole vault .
fraid so .
oh . oh .
hello .
are you jenny hill ?
how did you know my father ?
were you and my father having an affair ?
wow . wow , you just said it . i was expecting to dance around this for another half hour .
can i ask you a question ? why did you come here today ? if you found this deed , why did not you just ask eddie ?
look , i do not know how much you want to know about any of this . you have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it . especially this late in the game .
logically , you could not be the witch , because she was old back when he was young .
no , it is logical if you think like your father . see , to him , there s only two women your mother and everyone else .
you did not become crazy .
thank you . i will bet you need to
yes .
i spent a week in morocco for the story . it was incredible .
i am going to get started on dishes .
i am going to check on him .
i am sorry . it seems every hour i have to . . .
do you like it , being pregnant ?
i do .
it is bad .
it is more than they thought . they are going to stop chemo .
you need to go .
i am going with you .
you do not have to .
i talked with your father last night .
you never told me how your parents met .
they met at auburn .
what about the details ? how they fell in love . the circus . the war . you never told me any of that .
that is because most of it never happened .
mmm .
mmm , what ?
do you love your father ?
everyone loves my father . he is a very likeable guy .
you have to understand . when i was growing up , he was gone more than he was here . and i started thinking maybe he has a second life somewhere else . with another house , another family . he leaves us , he goes to them . or maybe there is no family . maybe he never wanted a family . but whatever it is , maybe he likes that second life better . and the reason he tells all those stories is because he cannot stand this boring place .
but it is not true .
look , i know why you like him . i know why everyone likes him . but i need you to tell me i am not crazy .
you are not .
i need you on my side .
what happened ?
your father had a stroke . he is upstairs with your mom and dr . bennett .
how did you get here ?
we swam . the atlantic , it is not that big really .
ruth mchibbon offered to pick you up at the airport .
we rented a car .
is that dr . bennett s car ?
how is he ?
he is impossible . he will not eat . and because he will not eat , he gets weaker . and because he is weaker , he does not want to eat .
how much time does he have left ?
i do not know if you have seen it , but josephine has some photos in the most recent newsweek .
mom , would you say you understand dad ?
of course .
what i mean is , do you really know that is going on in his head ?
yes .
how is that possible ? i mean , you try to ask him a question and suddenly it is another one of his stories . you cannot honestly say you know him .
would you say you understand josephine ?
yes . but that is a different . . .
josephine and i have a lot in common .
yes , you both think william bloom is a very smart man . the problem is , you only see me as your mother , and not as someone s wife . and i have been his wife longer than i have been your mother . you cannot discount that .
i know it is not easy . just remember , he did not choose to be your father and you did not choose to be his son . you just ended up together . you could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it would be just the same . if you ask me , it is a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all .
but i understand you , mom . i always have .
before i forget , your father has papers in the basement i would like you to go through . i would not know that is important .
was she one of your teachers ?
no . but it is weird . she seemed to recognize me .
that really happened ?
is he awake ?
mom ?
did you and dad have any other property ?
i suppose your grandmother s house when she passed on . but we sold that right away . your cousin shirley bought it .
so you never bought any land .
i do not suppose one of us could stay with him . in case he . . . in case he wakes up , one of us should be there .
i will stay . why do not you go home with josephine and i will stay tonight .
mom , do you want some time with dad ?
you first .
put it in the cases . split it up . and do not forget you owe me .
what for ?
you know what for .
no i do not .
i got you those trousers from paul smith .
i have been buying you stuff all week . i have been buying him stuff all week .
when we went to the hard rock cafe . who paid ? when we went to see cats . who paid ?
those are not presents . that is normal friendship stuff
yeah it was okay .
yeah . it was quite good actually . some bits i really liked .
the sets were good .
sixty four thousand , eight hundred .
it is enough is not it ?
what do you mean ?
you know what i mean babe , it is enough . we can stop .
do you want to stop ?
yes .
that is this ?
it is nothing . i burnt myself .
that is not a burn .
do you like it ?
say thank you .
what ?
a baby ? what are we supposed to do with a baby ?
what ? what are you doing ?
what . you are what ? you are with this creep now .
leave him !
you have . you have actually fallen for this prick .
this is sensitive . your car . lovely car . does not necessarily give the right impression .
ch . . .
to customers approaching the bank from the rear
right .
you can see why it is sensitive ?
hello .
i thought you could give us the tour this morning . sort of be our indian guide .
how is that ? we cannot drink our piss can we ?
hang on hang on , sorry , but like , who are you ?
you must find some glasses , small , for the toast , and some plates .
sorry . you have lost me . . .
i am asking what you are here for .
what did he say ?
i need to know who you are first please .
oh . we are russian .
yes . i know .
good .
and . . .
hold on .
so hang on . you are both nadia s cousins ?
of course not . alexei , he is is my problem .
right .
we better watch him . he is crazy .
right .
no .
so ?
what was that ?
i asked her if you were happy to see us . i find it hard to tell with you .
so how long will you be in england ?
plans are for the architects , politicians and so forth .
you must have a visa or something . . .
you are asking for my documents ?
she says hello to you . go for it john !
uh . do you like england ?
she says she has a secret to tell .
when ?
i saw you waiting there , by the gate .
i . . .
binoculars .
what was that ?
oh nothing .
tell me .
no . it is too judgmental .
tell me what he said .
you are not ashamed of it ? it is no surprise to want to love .
no . it is not that .
do you believe in love ?
i suppose it is . . . i mean define your terms .
how is bank ?
fine . i thought you were leaving today .
i understand . i am so sorry
you can stay tonight .
i have brought you trouble . maybe i should have come alone .
put the fucking kettle down .
john .
he says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers . john , he is a soldier . a trained killer . we must do what he says .
what did he say ? tell me !
he says you are very sad ridiculous man . i do not agree of course . and that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute . nadia is a prostitute . i am sorry .
what does he want . the russian shithead . what do you want ?
he wants money .
he wants a lot of money .
i will give him money . tell him to put the . . .
he wants the money from your bank .
i will fucking give it to him ! we will go down there .
you do not understand . he wants all the money that is in your bank .
oh jesus .
he is sure you can do this . of course you can not .
just leave her alone .
i am so sorry .
is that everything ?
yes .
it is about forty miles from here . i do not know if you have looked at a map , it is close to london but it is a city in itself . a roman city . it is a nice house . i am having a problem with ants . i uh . . . it is the warmer weather . i cannot seem to find the nest . sorry , do you understand ants ?
yes .
i just cannot find a nest . the root of the problem . i have looked everywhere . that is the russian for ant ? sorry that is a stupid . . . sorry . this is strange is not it .
yes .
i am pretty nervous . are you ?
yes .
so . is it different to how you imagined it ?
yes .
i bet . what about me ? am i how you imagined ?
and how was the flight . sorry , am i speaking too fast for you ?
do uh . . . sorry . can you follow me ? do you understand what i am saying ?
yes .
good . or should i speak slower ?
yes .
do you follow or should i speak slower ?
uh . . . are you a giraffe ?
today is bath day .
i do not understand .
syevodnya ?
syevodnya
frenzy .
they go . john . they go .
that is wrong ?
they go .
of course . they go . yes . yes .
oh , i do not know . in my job as deputy assistant of new business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals . this took a lot of understanding and sympathy , to try to work out solutions to their problems . but , you see , i am not in that line of work anymore . nowadays i am a bank robber .
you do not understand anything .
unless . unless this is part of the routine . you get tied up , stick around , distract me , they both bust in and steal my cup of coffee .
it is makes it easier . okay .
i do not want to know .
it makes it faster . if i do not speak to the men , they fall faster . it is pretty obvious why .
so what are you going to do ?
i am going to drink my coffee . then , we are going to the police station . where there will be lawyers , loss of job , house , humiliation , gutter press , and probably prison .
they do not blame you . when a bank employee does this they understand . you get your life back . anyway i bet you hated that bank .
even so i always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me .
why else would you send off for me ? if you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute .
you must think . . . i am the biggest pillock . . . in the world .
no i do not .
in the world .
i know you just want to punish me
i do . i want to very badly .
so you are just going to be vindictive
in every sense . if at all possible .
you cannot hurt me more than i am hurt already .
where is the restroom ?
what ?
i am going to be sick . where is the . . .
what ? no you are not . .
i am going . . . i am . . . i am going to be sick .
you do not have to do this . i can look after myself .
have you got your passport ?
what ?
shut up . have you got your passport ?
give me some money .
what ?
so , uh , alexei , which i know is not his name . . .
i do not want to talk about him .
fine .
it is none of your business .
so uh . . .
look , if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is .
oh jesus .
if what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you , then yes he does .
of course . of course . of course he does . of course . thank you . thanks .
not the kids type then is he ? not that broody . you must be pretty miffed .
he will come back .
excuse me ?
he left me my passport and ticket . it is pretty clear he wants to see me again .
yeah . i tend to tie up and abandon women i really want to see again too .
i do not want to talk about it .
why not ?
shut up . i am not listening .
you do not want to talk about it .
no .
we will pretend it never happened .
so . that is it like having to fuck men you hate ?
i do not hate you .
okay . let s . . . okay . okay . you have had sex with people you do not like have not you ? for money . to make money .
and ? what are you saying ?
and . it is wrong .
and who says what is wrong .
and that would be morals . that would be one s own moral sense of decency .
that is a moral orgasm john ? tell me how it feels exactly .
so . what then ? you just detach sex from everything . .
whereas wet ng wild is an emotional journey . tied and tethered . it is pretty moving huh ? like anna karenina .
so what ? do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you are with him , or what ?
sometimes .
sometimes which ?
sometimes neither .
some . . . what does that mean ?
there s nothing wrong in liking sex , john .
i do not like sex . i do not think i will be having sex ever again .
why ?
well , it is just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman , or alone for that matter , makes me want to die .
so now you hate all women ?
i think it is my safest bet , do not you ?
what ?
you . . .
i got what i paid for .
it was not what i wanted .
so what did you want ? i think we understand each other , no ?
you do not understand me .
excuse me ?
get out
you are throwing me out .
you know , in russia , there s no work for women . it is a different world .
you do not have to say anything
what ? i . . . i was not saying . . .
please , there s no . . . oh .
i was not saying anything .
fifteen . you do not know him . he was very kind and strong .
yeah . he is a smashing bloke .
the rest of the world , john , it is not all like st . albans .
thank christ for that .
you are pretty naive if you think it is .
i am pretty naive ? look at you . you have to do all this , and what have you got to show for it ? nothing .
i do not have nothing .
do you know if it is a boy or a girl ?
no .
have you had any before ?
no .
are you scared ?
what happened between you and the blonde ?
what ?
the thin . . . the girl with small eyes . the one in your cupboard .
it is none of your business . she did not have small eyes .
did she leave you ? come on . it is nothing to be ashamed of . who did she leave you for ? your best friend ? her boss ? a woman ? did she leave you for a woman , john ?
i am sorry .
what ?
i do not know why i said it . i am sorry .
she is alive ! ! she is not dead ?
you should stop smoking . you are pregnant . you smoke like a fucking lab dog .
i am trying to quit .
i have got news for you . it is not working .
i smoke more these days . i smoke more when i am unhappy .
nobody s that unhappy .
maybe i want to die . do not you want me to die ?
i do not want anyone to die .
except for small eyes .
i do not know .
what was her name ?
you know you can come under the blanket .
i have got an hour . can i buy you a coffee ?
no . i think i better just go .
okay . thank you .
yeah . no thanks .
please . why not ?
okay . goodbye .
something else .
you can probably buy them on the flight .
i am quitting . this will be my last one . so . goodbye .
goodbye .
you did not deserve me john buckingham .
whatever .
i am sorry .
it is not mine .
it is not mine either .
why ?
i am not asking you to marry me .
no . what ? no . i know .
it is more like a date .
it is a long way to go for a date .
what does it mean ?
hurry . i will wait for you here .
my name s sophia .
is the flight full ?
i am sorry sir . i believe the flight is closed .
you have excellent english .
thanks .
how do you want to pay ?
what are you doing ?
just wanted to see .
you know the rules . you do know the rules , do not you ?

i brung you a little basket of goodies . fresh squash , tomatoes , some okra , butter beans .
you did not have to do this .
just wanted to say how much i appreciate you helping me the other day . my niece , she is cured up , and i got you to thank .

some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume . so now they have scented creams . they help moisturize a womangs skin . this one s my favorite . it is called ginger souffle . i recommend . . . applying the cream while the skin is still damp . so . . . perhaps just after a shower .

my daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts . that is a group of farmers , you know , each season they would rotate the crop . know why it is best to rotate em like that ?

itches .
means ya healing . so all this farming make me think on matthew . matthew . the parable of the sower ? man toss seed on rock , on the wayside , some fell in thorns . . . you know the story ?

you a preacher ?
that is right .
can i ask you a question ? people always say , you gotta get good with jesus , if you want not to go to hell . that you say sorry for all you done and . . . and jesus would let you go on to heaven .
you could put it that way .
but that is so fucking stupid . i am sorry . did not mean to curse .
that is on your mind ?
you cannot hurt people . . . and then just say , i am sorry , and then everything just gets washed away . why would heaven want people like that . people who . . . do what they want and then . . . switch .
it starts like this . . . fire . . . that spreads . starts in my head . then moves to my stomach . then it goes lower . i can stop it sometimes but mostly i just jump on and ride it out . . . then everything will go back to normal , you know . only thing ever took that feeling away was . . . was . . . when i met ronnie . cuz i love him so much . he is all i got in my life that is special . and i like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous . when i can do that for him . . . it is like i am giving something of myself that i have not giving nobody else .

one guy do all the damage ?
yeah .

why ?
he is wanted in japan . they want him first . then we can have him .
you and charlie are taking the jap home , tonight .
what . . . ? what if i say no ?
check your gun before you leave . they are not allowed in japan . it is a nice , safe country .
why me ?
it is not your job .
he was my partner .
they are blaming it on you . christ , conklin , you did not even tell me you lost the prisoner !
i planned on catching him , captain .
how ? you do not know the place . you do not know the language . get on the plane .
he killed a police officer .
. . . remember , counterfeiting is the feds . they will be all over abolofia s place . stick tight . you i . d . the other plate , he does real time .
you lost a man we wanted for some time . it was very incompetent on your part , officer .
i want a gun .
it is not allowed .
we are police officers .
you are foreigners .
hey , inspector , i do not intend to take the rap for this .
could you fill me in ?
because i want you to tell me .
the young are eating the old , something that usually does not happen here .
that is this ?
your visa has expired . be on a plane in twenty four hours or you will be deported .
while you were hanging out at the visa office , we found the son of a bitch .
hey . . . ! hey , i am talking to you , inspector !
your plane leaves at six . two officers will escort you .
for god s sake , ohashi , i need your help . let me out of here !
you had my help , detective .
if anything happens to her while i am here
do you know where she is , detective ? do you know how to find her ? even where to start ? we will find them .
i have to get to sugai .
seven years work by the finest engraver . mass produced , sequentially numbered . the best there has ever been , mr . conklin .
i am impressed . but let s use the short form . i am looking for
i took kobo from the street . i gave him a home , a future . . . but my ways were too slow for him . . . i served seven years in prison for my boss when i was a young man . kobo would not serve seven minutes for his oyabun . he was supposed to take over this syndicate when i retired .
i want him .
our associates in new york were close to closing a deal with us .
the families who control the casinos ?
imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar .
the feds would be onto you in a month .
why tell me this ?
the other plate is currently in new york , in the hands of kobo s man . find it for me .
you trust me ?
with these ?
swiss bank deposit . gold bullion . whatever you want . you know the city and the police .
if i say no ?
you are smarter than kobo . you know the price of deceit . think about it .
good .
that was not our deal .
you want him dead too .
cannot thank you enough , mr . sebastian . if you had not come along . . .
we are not used to the big city . where we come from it is not so easy to get lost .
you certainly have a nice place here .
he knows what he is doing .
if he will not cooperate ?
i am sure glad you found us , sebastian . what do you think , mary ?
i do not think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us .
let s go while there is still time .
where ?
that is the point ?
not to be trapped .
one man . he must be good .
then go get him .
the name is batty . roy batty .
yeah . it might be better if we talk in private , sebastian . why do not you go home .
i am surprised you did not come to me sooner .
it is not an easy thing to meet your maker .
and what can he do for you ?
can the maker repair what he makes ?
would you like to be modified ?
had in mind something a little more radical .
that is the problem ?
death .
i want more life , fucker .
the facts of life . i will be blunt . to make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system , at least by men , makers or not , it fatal . a coding sequence cannot be revised once it is established .
why ?
because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies like rats leaving a sinking ship . the ship sinks .
what about e . m . s . recombination ?
then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells .
would not obstruct replication , but it does give rise to an error in replication , so that the newly formed dna strand carries a mutation and you are got a virus again . . . but all this is academic you are made as good as we could make you .
but not to last .
also you are too valuable to experiment with .
i have done some questionable things .
also extraordinary things .
i like a man who stays put . an admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times . you live here all by yourself , do you ?
how about breakfast , i was just going to make some .
if it would not be too much of a bother . . . a little bite to eat would be . . .
oh , no bother , i would be glad to .
why are you staring at us ?
what , sebastian ?
what generation are you ?
show me something ?
like what ?
we have a lot in common .
you mean that you cannot come here and i cannot go there ?
not only that , but we have smiliar problems . accelerated decrepitude . but we do not want to die quite yet .
of course not .
you could help us .
i do not know much about biomechanics , roy . i wish i did , but you are out of my league .
what about your friend , the man who owns this building ?
he is not really my friend . i just do a job for him now and then .
tyrell could help us , sebastian .
he could ?
his company made us .
i would be happy to mention it to him .
be better if i could talk to him in person . but he is not an easy man to get to .
no .
when do you deliver your project ?
you are our best and only friend .
where are you going , sebastian ?
just thought i would . . .
that is going on down there ?
he is not ready yet .
when ?
this is my uncle roy , sebastian .
then we are stupid and we will die .
i think , therefore i am .
i want to do it .
six , huh ?
five . three nights ago one of them managed to break into the tyrell corporation . killed two guards and got as far as the genetic sector before he got fried going through an electro field .
what was he after ?
you got a machine on it yet ?
we are using esper a that picked up holdengs alarm . its guess is that all five are in the city .
the tyrell corporation has a demo model . check it out on the voight kampff . there s a chance the nexus is beyond out ability to detect . if that is the case , everybody s up shit creek .
what was the cover on the one that got holden ?
industrial refuse .
yeah .
bryant here . regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants , esper s concluded that the only irregular category that tyrell s got is the entertainment section . you better get on it .
i was just about to have my dinner .
she was gonna get away .
i did not like her .
look , go home . get some rest . take an aspirin .
yeah .
this is bryant . are you alone ?
yeah .
she is not with you ?
take a number . canapt , tenth floor , villa vita district , olympia south .
got it .
if you do not , we will . it has to be total , deckard . that is an order from as high as it comes . got it ?
yeah . i got it .
it is gotta be right for my customer .
well , when do you get paid ?
soon as i finish the job .
when might that be ?
day after tomorrow .
machines can be helpful sometimes , but they can also be a pain in the ass . ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel mill . i do not mind a bum steer once in a while it is their personalities that usually get me . somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image . if that is true , whoever made esper should have been shot .
you equipped for random questions ?
why , yes , of course .
you start .
the five in question are third generation nexus sixes , constructed of skin flesh culture , selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self perpetuating thought , para physical abilities and developed for emigration program . are you with me ?
how do i stop one ?
unlike a five , they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another . sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run ,
okay , but . . .
here s something you might find interesting . they have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum . however , after a period of time it is only logical that such a mechanism would create its own emotional responses , hate , love , fear , anger , envy .
i know all that .
what about a summary then .
yes ?
do you have something against science ?
not if it works .
and what in your estimation works ?
four years . which would make her termination date . . .
never mind . do they have that knowledge ?
okay , gimme a run down on the three females .
nexus designated mary incept november , domestic conditioning non competitive , trained for day care position .
next .
nexus designated pris incept data december , competitive , programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers .
number three .
i think i have no money .
it is okay . forget it .
but i would like to buy you drink .
i will but you one . what will you have ?
vodka !
shot of vodka , please .
thank you very much .
prosit .
you want to see my friends ?
sorry , do not have the time .
those cockroaches ?
how long you had these guys ?
prosit .
you like to kiss her goodbye .
i like you .
i like you too .
one more , eh ?
how old am i ?
my birthday is april , . how long do i live ?
i am great . i mean , i know i am not really great , but i feel just great . how you like my new suit ?
do not make me laugh . it makes me pee .
sorry .
hey , it is okay . i like to pee . so how are you doing ?
i am doing okay .
from what i hear you are doing great . bryant tells me you are going like a god damn one man army . making a lot of money , huh ?
yeah . but that is what i wanted to talk to you about .
money ?
no . i got a problem .
let s hear it .
that is that ?
love is just another name for sex . love is sexy and sex is lovely i do not care what you call it , an android cannot have it .
these are not just . . .
nerves of steel .
no rust ?
i did not say that . your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time .
meaning ?
during the road test . . .
yeah ?
your mind kept wandering . that bothered me .
huh huh .
considering the nature of your work , that could be unhealthy .
but you have not put in for emigration .
nope .
you are going to be over the limit .
listen , i could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but i still rather be here than up there .
what if you change your mind ?
they will change the limit before i change my mind .
you sure ?
why did not you go ?
too old .
my job is here .
taffey lewis ?
yes ?
i would like you to take a look at these pictures .
you see i lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little . . . what am i supposed to be looking for ?
this one looks familiar , but i do not know . naw . there s one came in today looks a little like this one but . . .
what did she want ?
who ?
the girl that does not look like that girl .
nothing . she wanted to know about suck night .
what night ?
i did not know if i wanted to handle her i already got a snake act . but my partner goes down there to the opera house on suck night to book the good ones .
that is suck night ?
that is what we call in the trade , audition free for alls and most of it sucks . bit i do not think that is her .
book the good ones for where ?
lots of places . the tours , the clubs , the silicone shows , private parties .
what shows ?
yeah ?
there s been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place .
i do not know nothing about it .
how do you mean exploited ?
like to get this position . did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person ?
are you for real ?
oh , yeah . you would be surprised what goes on around here . i would like to check the dressing room if i could .
what the fuck for ?
it that mother real ?
of course he is not real . you think i would be working here if i could afford a real snake ?
it is a good job .
the best .
does it eat ?
jeezus !
sorry .
you would be surprised what a guy will go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body .
i bet i would .
me .
it seems your department does not believe out new unit is to the public benefit .
a humanoid robot is like any other machine , it can be a benefit or a hazard . if it is a benefit , it is not our problem .
it is artificial ?
are you apprehensive ?
why should i be ?
i would not accept it . also , i would report the person who gave it to me to the police .
i would take him to the doctor .
you are watching t . v . and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist .
in a magazine you come across a full page photo of a nude girl .
is this testing whether i am an android or a lesbian ?
you become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend , and you decide to get an abortion .
i would never get an abortion .
why not ?
that would be murder , mr . deckard .
in your opinion .
it would be my child .
last question . you are watching an old movie . it shows a banquet in progress , the guests are enjoying raw oysters .
is there anything else ?
i know you think it complicates your work , but i am here to help .
i have already got more help than i need .
there s two reasons a man rejects help . either because he is so good at what he does he does not think he needs it , or he is so insecure he cannot admit it .
sounds like i am an ass hole either way , but the answer is still no .
two of us might be more effective than one .
you use your equipment , do not you ?
so ?
do i make you nervous ?
yeah .
i can imagine .
they probably want to find out when they were made .
do not just stand there looking at me . it is not polite .
what do you want me to do ?
you ever take a bath with a man before ?
i told you i would come back .
you did ?
who is this ?
me and my dad .
where is he ?
dead .
how come you are not on the job ?
i am . part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out .
how are you doing ?
what do people do in the afternoon ?
do you dream ?
yeah . sometimes .
did you cry when your father died ?
yeah .
nobody is freer than when he dreams . i read that .
it was not very good last night , was it ?
i do not know , i have nothing to compare it to . i guess i thought there was something more to it .
what ?
i do not know . . . i think i missed something .
like ?
when was the last time you cleaned this place ?
hmmm ?
have you ever cleaned your apartment ?
do not be fooled by appearances .
they could clean around the arrangement .
but if i do not plug it in how can i . . .
never mind the plug , just go through the motions .
but then how can you . . .
this feels stupid .
you are sick , deckard .
have you ever known anybody a long time ?
you mean a woman ?
uh huh .
that is a long time ?
ten years .
why do you call it retire , why do not you call it murder ?
because it is not .
do not you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered ?
andies only simulate suffering if they are programmed for it .
do you think i simulated what happened between us ?
do not leave here . do not open the door , do not answer the phone .
what difference will it make ?
you know what i think ?
what ?
where the hell you been ?
you know where i been . i been on vacation .
next time you go on vacation , do me a favor , let us know where it is .
that is up ?
bad ?
severed spine . you would better get in here . bryant s waiting for you .
thanks .
black ?
is this to be an empathy test ?
yes .
may i ask a personal question ?
go ahead .
have you ever retired a human by mistake ?
no .
but in your profession that is a risk .
nothing is infallible , but so far the voight kampff scale bas been foolproof .
like you said , mr . deckard , a machine can be a hazard . the voight kampff scale is a machine , is not it ?
one that relies on human interpretation . where is the subject ?
well ?
if she is , the machine works .
how many questions did it take ?
she did not know ?
how many questions does it usually take , mr . deckard ?
and how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground ?
discreetly .
let s keep our eyes on the road , deckard .
we are going to have to start the sequence again if you do not stay with me , deckard . concentrate .
how do you know i am not ?
you are not responding to the stimulus . i can see right here , i am not getting a reading .
i am tired of this .
i kinda get nervous when i take tests .
do not move .
already had i . q . test this year but i do not think i never had a . . .
you are in a desert , walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a . . .
what ?
what desert ?
does not make any difference what desert it is completely hypothetical .
but how come i would be there ?
maybe you are fed up , maybe you want to be by yourself who knows . so you look down and see a tortoise . it is crawling towards you . . .
a tortoise . that is that ?
know what a turtle is ?
of course .
same thing .
but i understand what you mean .
whatcha mean , i am not helping ?
how come you were in my truck ?

i have got stuff . if you wanna go to my place ?
whatcha doing ?

methuselah syndrome .
that is that ?
my glands . they grow old too fast .
is that why you are still here ?
ah , you get hold of your friends ?
as a matter of fact i did . they have got some work to do tonight , but they are gonna come tomorrow .

get out of here !
come on , heathcliff , i will walk you to the corner .

no , i am lost .
you are lost ?
say , . . . did you just lose your job because of me ?
forget it . i am sick of working for that dickhead .
dickhead ?
that is wrong with you ?
i just had a mental picture of . . .
i came on a bus .
why does not that surprise me ?
well , i guess because i am a little psychic . . . i have this thing .
oh , that is nice .
so far ?
yes , i am right ?

i knew it ! so anyhow , you get on a bus and before you know it , you are out here in the san fernando valley without a clue . which brings us to here . correct again ?
again .
where are you staying ? the holiday inn ?
yes ! yes ! the holiday inn ! that is exactly right !
see ? i am psychic . not completely , but pretty much . that was pretty good , was not it ? !
it was amazing .
yeah . thanks . anyhow , let me predict a bus for you to get on .
do you own a car ?
i am not taking you there , sweetie . rule number one in north america no strangers in the car .
if it will make you feel any better , i do not have a gun .

wait ! please wait ! i will make a deal with you ! i will give you a rogers hornsby , if you will take me to the hotel !
rogers hornsby ? ! ?
rogers hornsby s worth like four thousand dollars !

i knew this would happen ! you are like a lost puppy !
cannot you please just talk to me for one second ?
troy ? is he your husband ? or a boyfriend ?
no .
thank q !
oh , stop that ! god ! listen , i know you like me . i can tell . but you know what ? a lot of guys like me . not me , exactly . it is more like the legs or the butt or the hair . or some combination of the above .
i think it is the eyes .
the eyes . okay . an eye man . anyhow , it never works out . okay ? not that you even need to know that ! you look like crap , by the way . what have you been doing ?
watching television in color .
hey , no kidding ? in color ?
see , ya .
why does not it never work out ?
what ?
why does it never work out ? you and . . . men ?
. . . okay .
it never works out because i am into legs and butts and hair myself ! that is why ! so i wind up with guys who are very good looking , but even more shallow than i am , if you can picture that . now , if you will excuse me , i have to go find another low paying , demeaning job where some guy named jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is .
why not go to work for me ?
doing what ?
selling all my baseball cards . and helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks .
well , they are not starving yet , but they need help .
how long would you need me ?
two weeks .
that is the pay ?
that is fair ?
you got it ! wait here while i change .
why not buy them milk or something instead of dr . pepper ?
they like dr . pepper .
who are these people ?
my mom and dad .
very funny , smart ass .
wait ! wait !
well , another day , another dollar . stop staring at me ! !
pick you up at eight tomorrow morning .
hey , you know . i was thinking . . .
we will have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry .
it is your life . and , by the way , it is a dandy .
i guess we will need another locker .
no problem . we will just sell another baseball card .
thank you .
and , um . . . i guess . . . i guess you and i , uh . . .
adam ? do not even think about it . okay ? i am sorry . i know that sounds mean , but believe me , it would be meaner if i did not say it . okay ?
okay .
there s something else i would like you to help me with .

oh , i am sure it will !
then forget it .

this is for me .
well . . . okay . i would like you to help me find a . . . wife .

i do not want to be alone .
you can be single and not alone . marriage bites !

i did not know that .
everybody knows that . ask my divorced sisters . or ask my divorced mom and dad .
they are all divorced ?
everybody s divorced .
it did not used to be that way .
i would not know . what kind of wife are you looking for ?
one who s not a mutant .
no dogs , huh ? okay .
when do you need her by ?
two weeks .
well , i could probably get you laid in two weeks , but to locate a non mutant wife from pasadena . . . that could take some time .
could we talk about that a little later ?
of course .
get out !
now , get out ! !
yes , ma am !
stop that ma am crap !
you almost got us killed !
i told you i have never driven before !

you said it would be easy !
i was wrong ! !

yes !
why , thank you ! very nice to have met you , cliff ! may i ask you a question ?
he is a former boyfriend . we lived together for about six months . and yes , i will admit it . i have still kind of got a thing for him . that is what you wanted to know , is not it ?
actually , no . i was wondering why cliff likes to wear another mangs underpants .
here you go . one champagne cocktail .
thank q !
i thought only hookers drank those things .
okay , let s see . . . i am not promising anything . you okay ?
um hum .
i am seeing . . . snow . . . lots of snow . way up north . are we getting hot ?
yes !
you live in . . . alaska . the only way in or out of your place is by plane and . . . you have definitely come down here for food and supplies and . . . to find a wife !
yeah , right ! that is where you would go to find girls ! nome . he is gay , by the way .
where is he gone ?
he is gone to check your answers on his computer .
he has a computer ?

in the house ?
no . we keep it in the backyard . of course , in the house . it is in there .
may i please be excused ?
all right .
the what ?
the guy with the underpants !
about clothing ?

what about holding your right arm up like that all the time ?
he is going to kill himself . go skate out on the bike path ! it is that way !
hey , eve !
have you ever heard the saying , he has not got enough sense to come in out of the rain ?
yep . you know , my father who is a scientist says that everything is a miracle . everything . until recently i wasn t sure what he meant by that .
yeah ? no kidding . listen , you still want to go girl hunting tonight ?
i certainly do !
okay . but you know , this business of finding you a wife it is kind of ridiculous , do not you think ?
no it is not !
yes it is . a girlfriend maybe . but a wife ? i mean . . .

hey , screw you ! okay ? you think i am just somebody you can buy off ! listen , let me tell you something

what about her ?
no way .
why ? ! i think she is very attractive .
adam ! she is got bitch written all over her ! you do know what bitch means , do not you ?
yes , i have a dictionary . but i cannot understand for the life of me why you would call her that ! or why cliff would say that about you .
because we are bitches ! look at her ! look at the expression on her face ! the walk , the jewelry , the fingernails . please !
okay . i like that .
yeah , sweet . that is a nice way of putting it .
really ?
that is ridiculous .
yeah . could be . go say hello , romeo . looks like a healthy non mutant to me .
okay . all right . and what do i say ?
what ?
romeo and juliet . i cried at the end .
you wanted to see me !
you are not from alaska ! where would you learn to dance like that ? ! and there are no starving people , are there ? !
why are you suddenly so mad at me ?
do not change the subject ! i want you to tell me the truth about yourself .
i have never lied to you . i have maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe , but i have never lied .
you think i am some sort of sap ? ! do not you ? !
no . i admire you . i . . . i fell in love with you the first time i saw you . i did . i think that you are the most

adam . . . dumb question , but humor me . have you ever had sex before ?
uh huh . adam ?
yes , eve ?
i want you to go back to the hotel now . i will call you a cab .
that is right . and i will see you in the morning in the lobby . do you mind waiting outside for the taxi ?
not at all . and eve thank you for tonight . . . and for the kiss . my first .

it was at least as good as the sky .
really ? okay !
and i think better than the ocean . i am serious !
hi , eve !
adam . . . . you should go with dr . aron . it is the best thing . the best thing for you . i promise .
. . . all right , eve . if you say so .
. . . i do .
no .
see ! i cannot tell them that ! i cannot ever let them know . it makes their life . . well , frankly . . . a joke . i cannot let that happen . you understand ?
we can make this work , adam ! believe me ! i am very good at making things work !
is that a birthday cake ? !
yes , it is .
is this because of the radiation ?
what ?
good evening . i want to stay at this hotel .

i know it has been terrible . but it was not your fault . and now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better . you understand ?
yes .
i have got to go , now .
of course you do . i will stay here and pray .
that is always a good idea ! would you like some money ? i have a great deal of it .
no . i do not need money anymore i see that now .
how do i leave here ?
the front door is open . will you be back ?
i have got almost everything we need ! and this nice man . . .
this is what money looks like . it comes like this , in coin , or like this in paper . or you can have an investment . these are stock certificates that we bought in your name . of course , they are worthless now , but at one time they were quite valuable .
they are pretty . can i have them ?

and , i am asking you to trust me without understanding why .
this is great son , just great . by the way , eve s last name . rus to kov , that is not russian , is it ?
it is ukrainian . her grandparents immigrated here .
uh huh .
dad , i do not know how to tell you this . and i was going to wait a while , but i think . . . dad , there was no bomb . a plane crashed into our backyard . i looked it up in old newspapers .
you are sure ?
positive . the soviet union collapsed without a shot being fired . the cold war is over .
that is what everybody believes ?
yes , sir . it is true .
what ? did the politburo just one day say we give up ?
yes . that is kind of how it was .
my gosh , those commies are brilliant ! you have got to hand it to em ! no , we did not drop any bombs ! oh yes , our evil empire has collapsed ! poor , poor us ! i bet they have even asked the west for aid ! right ? !
uh , i think they have .
you have very nice ceilings .
i do ? well , thank you ! you like ceilings ?
not particularly .
well , i hope you like these ! fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed . or nori if you prefer . i love sushi .
i love lucy !
it is a very small place . people do not even know it is there .
and it is called . . . ?
maybe eve can guess . she is psychic .
right on the button .
that is right ?
i have never met anyone like you in my life .
i have got goose bumps all over me .
well , we try . listen , let me just ask you a few questions . when did alaska become a state ?
.
who use to own it ?
russia .
when did we get it from them ?
. seward s folly . we paid . million dollars for it . a tidy sum then , as well as now . i am quoting my father , of course .
that is the capitol ?
juneau .
hello ! it is anchorage ! gotcha !
this must be very new .
yeah .
it is so small .
what are you talking about ? this is the new mac . you a hacker ?
i do not think so .
you do not have a computer in your cabin ?
no .
how do you get through those winters ? well , you are right . juneau . that is the highest peak ?
mt . mckinley . it is also the highest point in north america .
okay , maybe she is psychic . let s go eat !
that would knock my father out .
yeah ?
oh , yes . it would probably kill him .
he is a windows guy then , huh ?
yes . he likes windows .
well , i think windows stink . what do you think of that ?
. . . i guess it is . . . just a matter of personal taste .
not on him .
i am not wearing his pants .
why not ? he has great pants .
i just do not want to .
is not it a little tiring to sit up straight like that ?
i guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new .
almost all of them .
the recovery is very impressive .
the recovery ? oh , yeah ! hey , they rebuilt the freeway in six months .
that is why little things mean so much to him .
why did you park way back there ?
miss rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car .
what ? !
yes ! lying is always a very effective dating tool .
i am sorry . i took the lord s name in vain again , did not i ? i am so sorry .
okay , troy ! let s get those all beef frozen patties !
how about we check with eve first ?
you bet !
so , did you buy a movie ?
what ?
a magazine ? a toy perhaps ? in the bookstore .
no , i would not go in one of those places with a gas mask on .
i know what you mean ! i usually wear a big hat and dark glasses .
does that work ?
good bye , adam .
bye , troy !
bye , adam !
and thanks for always being happy !
you dial nine to get out .
of what ?
the hotel .
thank you . your father is a smart guy .
my father is a genius .
no kidding . well . . . good night .
good night ! sleep tight . do not let the bedbugs bite ! that is what my mom always says . . . . . . who i am really beginning to miss . i am sorry . it is my first night away from home .
how old are you ?
thirty five .
you do not look thirty five .
how old do i look ?
twenty five ? around there .
i guess living up here makes people look older .
up here on the fifteenth floor ?
yes . up here on the fifteenth floor . goodnight .
what ? what is it ? !
the sky ! ! !
the sky ? where ?
up there ! !
i do not see anything !
help you ?
come on . frozen . how much are they ?
frozen , they are six thirty a dozen in the three pound box .
then i will need , twelve into nine hundred , seventy five boxes . and that is almost . . . five hundred dollars just for the hamburger ! and my mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything ! the yacht batteries ! the diesel oil ! the birthday candles !
sure .
well , that is great then ! terrific . . . except . . . it just occurred to me . i do not know where i live ! i am lost ! i do not know where home is ! would you excuse me ?
whatcha looking at ?
oh , my holy stars ! a negro !
say what ? !
how do you do , ma am .
i do alright .
hello .
how how much do you want for the mickey mantle , rookie season ?
i was thinking of selling all the cards .
see , my problem is , all i have are hundred dollar bills and i need something smaller . ones , fives , tens . like that .
i see what ya mean . tell you what . . . i will give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box .
oh , that would be wonderful !
sir ? i would really appreciate it if you would not take the lord s name in vain again .
i did not want to leave without saying how much i admire your jewelry .
oh . a nice one , i hope .
elbows , son .
sorry , mom !
dad !
he seems to be doing all right now . i do not know if he is had a heart attack or just . . . a horrifying experience . but we need supplies and i have got to stay with him .
i am afraid you have got to .
i will be all right .
i do not know how far you will have to travel to find supplies , but if you cannot get home by nightfall , i want you to look for something called a holiday inn . write that down . it is a hotel . there might still be one standing .
right .
i just hope this is still good up there .
yes ?
oh , adam , that would be wonderful if you could find a girl . one who s not a mutant . . . and hopefully comes from pasadena . nothing against valley girls , but in my day anyhow , the girls from pasadena , i do not know . . . always just seemed a little nicer .
here s the shopping list and , which should take care of everything .
yes , ma am .
your father has a few final words for you . you know , he would fight a buzz saw for you he loves you so much . we both do .
. . . and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down . but we have got to hurry .
are you in trouble , son ? !
i think i am being chased by a psychiatrist .
mom ? eve and i have to go .
what ?
we have to go .
this is your bedroom ?
no , mom , i have turned it into dad s office .
well , where are you
eve and i . . . eloped . we are married .
no .
oh , my god !
he will catch him . hi . this is nina aron . i have got a run away and i am going to need police assistance .
no ! not the police ! do not call them !
i have to . if a complaint is made and the person resists obser
no , i cannot have that ! they will come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs
calm down , please . this man needs help and you need protection from him . that is obvious .
you know , i do not think so . i am confused but you know , i do not think he would ever hurt me . i do not think he would hurt anyone .
and now you must let me be the judge of that !
i was frightened and i did not know what to think ! but you know i believe him . i think he just wants to go home . wherever the hell that is . . .
according to caltech , this webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase .
well , he and mrs . nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit .
unless we get a postcard or something , that is my guess .
what about relatives ?
all back east .
the neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here . she would bring him sandwiches and hot dr . pepper .
he drank it hot ?
yeah .
good god .
you got a light , honey ?
what ? ! a light ! yes , i have got a light !
so . . . you . . . survived the blast , did you ?
the blast ? honey , i have survived a host of things . like the song says a country boy can survive !
yes , yes , the song . so tell me . . . has it been . . . hell up here ?
hell up here ? honey , it is been hell up here , down there and over yonder ! hell everywhere .
yes , i can tell that just looking around . boy ? did you say you were a country boy ?
cute little old man , if you want a boy , i can be a boy . and if you want a girl , i can be a girl . i can be anything you want me to be !
really ?
uh huh . and it is all yours for the remarkably low price of only ! and if you act now , i might even throw in some free lawn furniture .
for pete s sake , calvin ! we have got guests !
sorry , honey ! i just got to fooling with this darn rheostat .
well , put it down and come in !
i am sorry everyone , but given this extraordinary turn of events , i think it is prudent that we cut the evening short . i am sure this cuban thing will resolve itself , but in the meantime . . . i would suggest taking a prayerful watch and wait stance !
it is time .
it shuts off automatically .
did you rig it to do that ? you are so clever .
no . they all do .
you hear that ? !
calvin , i wish you would have at least let me do the dishes . it is not going to be that easy getting all that dried on food off my nice plates .
i just hope those plates are not radioactive by tomorrow morning .
cheese is particularly troublesome .
worse than your kraft holiday dip ?
oh , much worse . but not as bad as that mexican jumping bean dip . you remember that ?
how long will we have to stay down here ?
i do not know . for this thing to blow over , it could take days .
days ? ?
rather safe than sorry . that is my motto !
but , what if i go into labor ? that could happen any time .
i have read up on it . i will deliver the baby myself if i have to .
now you listen to me calvin webber , when this baby comes , you are going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers .
yes , dear !
home sweet home !
that is that noise ?
the locks .
the locks ?
to keep us from trying to leave . after an atomic blast there s a radiation half life that lasts thirty five years .
thirty five years !
then after that it is safe .
to go up .
hi , honey ! feeling better ?
no .
we have to be strong , sweetheart . if not for ourselves , for the child .
burnt to a crisp . i have given you the most well done cut .
i am not hungry .
hot dr . pepper ! your favorite !
no , calvin , you are favorite .
maybe i have just got the creeps .
no . no ! calvin , this is different ! believe me !
would you like a tranquilizer ?
you have tranquilizers ?
oh , no .
what ?
uh , oh . now it is time .
is there a problem ?
no , calvin . babies cry .
i have noticed .
no . i think it is just right .
and i was wondering . . . if . . . if i could have a . . .
yes !
if i . . . you know . . .
calvin ? !
right here !
we looked all over for you . what are you doing back here ?
oh , i was just examining this rear hatchway .
why ?
no reason . well , it is pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off . so , you know , when the time is up , we will have to return to the surface using , you know , this back entrance . which is very nice because it has the service elevator !
very nice . unless it caved in , too .
watch this !
not bad for a three and a half year old ! i would like to see the public school system match that ! i do not care how terrific it is !
yes , he is very bright , dear . much like his father . but you know , calvin , maybe he is a little . . . young for school .
yes , you certainly will . and you will find a nice girl and rebuild america . just the way it used to be .
oh , calvin , i am not sure we should be making promises that perhaps cannot be kept .
hi , honey !
calvin !
get the presents and do the lights .
no kidding . who else would have done it ?
what did you wish for , adam ?
if he tells , it will not come true !
oh , that is just a bunch of baloney ! we never believed that in my family !
one who does not glow in the dark .
calvin webber ! what a thing to say !
let s eat our cake .
if we still have one .
yes . . .
you know , when we do go up . . . i am going to miss this old place . how about you , hon ?
would you excuse me ?
in the generator room again ?
oh , yes . it just fascinates me how all these things work .
should we say a little prayer first ?
yes , yes it is !
it is an archaic colloquialism , roughly meaning . . . good .
i am going to give it to you straight . there s no point in beating around the bush . there were survivors . apparently , the fallout has created . . . . a subspecies of mutants .
mutants ? !
others are . . . multi sexual . it seems . . . they can be both masculine and feminine . . . simultaneously .
no .
yes .
they have done a lot of re building but society , at least as we knew it , has utterly collapsed . people throw up in the streets . others point guns . there s something terribly wrong with the automobiles and . . . and i . . . i cannot tell you the rest . i just cannot .
oh my . oh , my , oh my , oh , my . so , what do we do now ?
we stay down here .
we do ?
yes .
for how long ? we have just about run out of everything !
we will make do . i am of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then
no , calvin . we are not going to make do . not me ! not adam . we are going up no matter what ! we deserve it . even if it is terrible !
well , i am the head of this household
i want him to at least see the sky !
and we will
and the ocean ! a mountain range !
he is smart .
and lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son , adam . amen .
how long will you set it for this time ?
i thought ten years .
well , that is . . . considerably shorter than before . i was wondering , calvin , why set the locks at all . i mean the radiation is gone and . . .
well , please excuse us ! we . . . we have not entertained a guest in . . . um . . .
some time .
what are you bitching about now ?
what are you doing here ?
i forgot some of my stuff .
you came back for these ?
hey , they are ralph laurens . and who s this interesting looking fellow ?
go home , cliff , wherever that might be .
so where is your roommate , the model ?
go home , adam . go to your hotel .
stop it , you two !
eve ! this guy is un be liev able !
i knew you would like him .
so , adam . . . where on earth are you from ?
since that guy rear ended me in palm springs .
oh , yes .
give me your hand .
but first , you have to start with the clothes !
i do not know .
you are serious , are not you ?
that is that supposed to mean ?
it means that your taste in mengs apparel is as bad as your taste in men .
well , that is blunt !
i am sorry . but if the shoe fits .
and i suppose you see him in some sort of strapless thing , do not you ?
i see elegant .
yeah ? like ralph lauren ?
alright , i will .
i am busy tomorrow anyway . i have to buy six thousand paper napkins .
well , what do you think ?
i think . . . it . . . works .
how about it , eve ? can he skate around your block ?
that water s freezing !
just be yourself .
always good advice .
are you kidding ? ! you would not even be a crumb on her table ! you do not see that ? !
eve ? !
well , i am trying to educate him ! it is nothing personal .
um . . . eve ?
go to the bathroom .
he go back to the hotel ?
that is that mean ?
we did not leave together .
that is it to you ? !
i am his pimp . he left with the dancers , did not he ?
hey , you are the psychic . eve , the psychic pimp . you tell me .
those sluts !
where are you going ?
to bed .
to bed ?
yeah . i am not the one who s in love with the guy .
in the first place , i do not fall in love with weirdos i have only known for four or five days .
yes , you do .
and i do not fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards ! !
uh , yes , you do .
or pee in their pants when they see the ocean !
yes , you do !
or have perfect table manners .
you know , i asked him about that . and he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them . see , you would eat like a slob if you were alone , but since another human being is present , you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners . i did not know that . i thought it was a way of appearing superior . know what else he told me ?
what ?
he thinks that i am a gentleman and that you are a lady !
well , consider the source . i do not even know what a lady is .
exactly ! i thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses . turns out , the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible . that is it ! if you do not do that , nothing else matters . the cars , the clothes , the houses . . .
where did he get all that information ?
from the oddest place . his parent s told him . i do not think i got that memo .
so now i suppose he is trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible .
he did not leave with them .
well . . . i admit it . i am glad to hear that .
he left with sophie .
what ? ! !
it is true . she swept him out the door whispering little french things into his ear .
what are you going to do ? go over to her place and kick in the door ?
i do not think so .
well what was i supposed to do ? ! he wants me to live underground with him ! that is like silence of the lambs , do not you think ? !
oh , no !
gay .
good god . . . you do not think there really is a bomb shelter , do you ?
what do you want to do with it ?
give it back to him .
and if we cannot find him ?
that is wrong ?
i do not know . everything s so neat . it is all just so . . . goddamn dear . damn !
millions upon millions upon millions ! the cards . the stock ! the clothes ! the toothpaste ! the guy was on the level ! and you blew it ! a man walks into your life who is the kindest , most polite , honest , trustworthy , incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life ! ! and what do you do ? !
have him committed .
yeah ! that is thinking .
he was always so nice ! how was i supposed to know that is a good thing ? ! nice is weird ! nice is . . . what is nice ? it is not cool ! i will tell you that . was it ever ?
i do not know . i like to think so .
well , at least i fell for him before i found out he was rich ! that is new . wait a minute ! he said today he knew where home was . what happened this morning ? ! where did you go ? !
to get some frozen poultry .
then what ?
we came back to the house !
you did not stop anywhere else ? !
no . no , wait a minute . we stopped at a porno store .
what ? !
an adult bookstore . he was very excited about seeing it . you think home is under a dirty bookstore in the valley ?
why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop ?
none of this stuff was here in . the valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards .
well , we have come a long way , have not we ? i want to go home .
adam ! !
where ? !
i am going to need two more banana splits and a cherry coke !
i cannot tell the boys from the girls anymore !
i miss those nice flower power kids . how about you ?
i am selling this place . i want out of this hell hole !
could i , like . . . oh , wow . . . like , uh . . .
buy it from me ?
yeah ! yeah , that is it !
tower . wolf one . i have got a problem here .
say your problem , wolf one . are you declaring an emergency ?
wolf one say intentions .
i have got secondaries of an engine fire and i will need to find a clear area to eject .
tower , say again ! !
the sar helo is airborne with you in sight .
i am marking the radial for five and ejecting .
i sent a trunk home yesterday . this is all i have .
you look good , jeffrey . did you have a nice flight ?
i think it is important not to get depressed . depression is a terrible thing . they say it can bring on illness .
jeffrey , you are not going down by lincoln , are you ?
doctor gynde , my whole family s sick . that is going on ?
will you tell mom when she gets home from the hospital that i have gone to dinner at sandy williams house ?
okay honey . that sounds nice . jeffrey . i think you have got termites in the house .
oh yeah ? have you seen any ?
i have seen a few .
well , i have not seen any . i would not worry about it . look , i better go .
i do not want to talk about it . everything s okay now . i do not want to talk about it .
sometimes it helps to talk things over . for instance , many marriages are saved by .
frank . come in .

are you detective williams ?
yes .
my name is jeffrey beaumont i live near you . i believe you know my father , tom beaumont beaumont s hardware store ?
sure i do . i understand he is in the hospital . how is he ?
he is alright , i guess . i hope . they are doing tests , that is why i am home from school . i was over at the hospital this morning and i was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood . there behind vista , i found an ear .
you did ? a human ear ?
yeah . i have got it here in this bag . i thought i should bring it to you .
by the way , jeffrey , this story is not going to the press and i am going to ask you to consider all you have heard strictly confidential . do not discuss this business with anyone , but me , or other police personnel . got it ?
got it . thanks for letting me in on as much as you did .
come into the study a minute .
detective williams here . yeah . tell him to go to sergeant milton . yeah , copy . well , jeffrey , you found something which is very interesting to us . very interesting . i know you must be curious to know more . but . i am afraid i am going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find , but also not to ask more about the case . one day , when it is all sewed up , i will let you know all the details . right now , though , i cannot .
i understand . i am just real curious like you said .
i was the same way when i was your age . i guess that is what got me into this business .
it must be great .
jeffrey ?
yes ?
these are beautiful . how is the case coming ?
okay .
anything you can tell me ?
the criminals are winning .
is that why you say it is horrible ?
yes .
i guess you have seen some bad things .
yes i have so bad i would not poison your mind by telling you .
why do you do it ?
i will not let the bastards get me up against the wall . it is an act of defiance .
what is this ? what color is it ?
what color is it ?
jeffrey ! come on in .
hi . hi sandy . i am sorry to bother you , but i have got to talk to you .
okay , come on in . looks like you had a bad face lift .
okay ?
and that man came out with a third man this well dressed guy . here s the photo . i think a girl named dorothy vallens is in trouble with these people . i think frank has taken her husband and her son .
i have no hard proof of any of this . her address is also on the photos . i think these people are involved with drugs , and murder . i think frank is killing drug dealers and . . . . . . and somehow frank is getting all their drugs . i had to tell you i got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to , but it is over now for sure . i had to tell you about these things in case it could help .
well now jeffrey , how did you come to get so involved ?
i cannot tell you the whole story . i . i took it upon myself . i cannot say more .
is sandy part of this ?
no , not at all .
who knows you have these ?
only you and the photo lab .
you are all through with this now ?
for now . alright , you better be . and sandy better not be involved with this , i can tell you . be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later .

yes it is me ! ! ! frank is on his way up to dorothy s apartment . oh no . frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say ! ! detective williams . hurry . i am in the apartment . hurry . i am hiding in the back bedroom .
because of your information i alerted internal affairs to check out detective gordon . i had to keep on with him as if nothing was different . he slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid frank s place .

frank , he did not mean it . leave him alone . come on . he did not mean it .
we are looking for him . in your opinion , why did frank kidnap dorothy s son and husband ?
he became obsessed with her . she hated him . he had to have her . he kidnapped them to control her . to make her do things . then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive . i am not kidding . frank loved blue , blue velvet . he had to have dorothy cause her whole life was blue .

hi dad .
looks like they have got you strapped in pretty good .
uh uh .
are you feeling okay ?
good to see you , son .
how ya doing dad ?
hey jeff . i am feeling so much better .
yeah , how did you know ?
oh yeah ?
you were pretty popular . did not you run for some office ?
yeah i did , treasurer . should not you be studying or something .
am i bothering you ?
no . you are not bothering me . you a senior ?
yes .
how is central these days ?
terrible boring .
what else is new ? right ?
yeah . what are you doing now ?
i am home from school . my father s in the hospital .
that is too bad .
what do you know about the ear ? anything ?
did not my father tell you not to talk about it ?
come on , you brought it up . do you know anything ?
i do not really know much but bits and pieces . i hear things . my room is right above my father s office . the ear , there s no corpse in the morgue missing an ear , and it did come off a living person . that is direct from the coroner s office . the person is unknown . there are a couple of cases i get mixed up on , but i think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear . i heard some of the same names .
do you know who was brought in for questioning ?
there were at least three , maybe four . but a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear . there s also a business man over by the franklin factory district that was questioned . and a musician . and some others .
were all these people questioned this afternoon ?
no , this has been going on for some time . several months . about six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river . they were from people who were reported missing . they never found one complete body , only parts .
the ear is from a missing person maybe ?
maybe so .
it is a strange world is not it ? do you know what building the woman lives in ?
yeah . it is close by , that is that is creepy . they have had her under surveillance for a couple of months , except i do not know what they have found out because my father is not in charge of her .
i guess you have to get back home soon ?
that is the building . she lives on the seventh floor . do not stop to look long , the police are watching .
where are they ?
did they find out anything when they questioned her ?
i do not know , like i said , she is not my father s case .
oh yeah . what about those other people ? anything ?
my father is watching the businessman . the businessman had a partner who disappeared . left his whole business and family , his wife and two kids . they think he is been murdered .
you really do hear a lot , do not you ?
yeah , i guess so . what are you going to do now that you are home ?
i have to help out in my father s hardware store . they are giving me sort of my own hours for a while , which is nice .
still , it must be kinda rough .
what happened to him ?
i have gotta go in .
i guess i will see you sometime .
i guess so . like you said . it is a strange world .
you hungry or thirsty , or both ?
i do not know .
i would like to talk to you about something .
i do not want to cause any trouble .
i am here , are not i ?
i guess mike s got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon .
alright , now tell me . what is it ?
there are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience . sometimes , in some cases , it is necessary to take a risk . i got to thinking . i will bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that womangs apartment , you know , sneak in and hide and observe .
you said it was a strange world . and you are the strangest part of it . are you crazy ? she is possibly involved in murder . this gives me the creeps .
settle down . i have a plan which i think will work . there is very little for you to do , but i do need your help . are not you curious about my plan ?
it would not hurt to hear the plan , i guess .
alright . the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that i could crawl into later .
now , how are you going to do that ?
right out in the car i happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig . i will go to her apartment and be the pest control man . i will spray her apartment . after a few minutes you will knock on her door , drawing her attention away from me and i will then jimmy a window .
what will i say when she comes to the door ?
you will be a jehovah s witness . i have a few awake magazines for you . you do not have to keep her very long . a few seconds is all i will need . whatiya think ?
i do not know , it sounds like a good daydream , but actually doing it is too weird . too dangerous .
let s just try the first part . if that goes well , we will see about the rest . no one will suspect us , because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this .
now , we will walk over so there s no license plates and you give me at least three minutes . i can stall if it is more , but i need time to find a good window , alright ?
alright .
okay , i am going ahead . wait a minute , that is her name ?
oh brother . dorothy vallens , seventh floor . look on the mailbox for her number , bright boy .
thanks . dorothy vallens . okay , goodluck . three minutes , no sooner .
are you alright ?
i was just about to go to the door , when that man did my job for me . was it alright ?
yes and no . did you recognize him ?
no . i only saw his back . he went down another stairwell at the end of the hall .
i did not get a good look at him either , but he sure looked at me . i did not have time to get a window , but i found this key . pretty nifty , huh ?
yeah , if it opens the door .
so , that is next ?
pretty clever . are you game for more ?
i owe you , since i goofed up this one .
you did not goof it up , but you still owe me one . i want to sneak in tonight . it is friday , do you have a date tonight ?
yes . i do .
you really want to do this , do not you ?
i will tell mike i am sick . there s a game tonight anyway and he will never miss me . afterwards he can go out with the guys . just so the record is kept straight though , i love mike . what do want me to do ?
first of all , we will have a nice dinner . try to find out where dorothy sings .
i already know . the slow club . it is on route .
great . i will pick you up around eight o clock . is that good ?
yeah , but do not pick me up . my father may think it is strange . i will walk over to your house . i will be there at eight o clock .
that is the plan .
first of all , we are going to the slow club to see dorothy vallens . we will watch her for awhile . i would like to hear her sing anyway , and then also we will know she is there and not in her apartment .
brilliant .
then we will drive back to her apartment and i will plant myself there .
that sounds good .
here s to . an interesting experience .
jeffrey , i do not think you ought to do it .
why not ?
it is crazy and dangerous . my god , i should not have told you .
it will be okay . i do not think you should wait out here though . i think you should go home . can you drive this car ?
yeah , but .
leave it in the front of your house for me , okay ?
ok .
could you wait a little while , this key may not fit .
i wish you would not do this . it does not make any sense . let s go somewhere and have some coffee .
i am going in , sandy . i will see you tomorrow and tell you how it went .
i , i do not want to see you tomorrow . mike s coming over .
oh , okay , can i call ?
okay , yeah , call .
look , it can wait till sunday .
call tomorrow . it is okay . good luck . i hope you can sneak out okay . you are going to wait until she is asleep ?
yeah .
i am going to wait here until she comes .
are you sure ?
okay , thanks .
i do not know if you are a detective or a pervert .
that is for me to know and for you to find out . i will see you . i mean call you , okay ?
well , how did it go ? what happened ?
well , i have found out some things , nothing really for certain . there are some strange people involved .
what did you see ?
that is with mike ?
he got a little jealous .
i am sorry , i did not . . .
you want a dairy queen ?
you want to tell me about it ?
ok . it is a strange world , sandy . this is what i have found out . what i think i have found out . dorothy vallens is married to a man named don . they have a son . i think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named frank who has now cut off both of dongs ears . i think he is holding them to make her do things for him . i think she wants to die . the ears were for her a warning to stay alive . there is another man involved . i call him the yellow man . you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door . i do not know what he does but i think he is on drugs supplied by frank . frank is a very dangerous man .
wow . should you tell my father ?
i do not see how i can , and i cannot prove any of this . i got all this information illegally . also it could get you in trouble .
you saw a lot in one night .
actually . i have been in twice .
twice . without her sensing anything ?
yes .
did you see her undressed ?
yeah . i mean a little , you know .
yeah ?
that does not bother you , does it ?
who , me ? why should it ?
that is what i thought .
you are sure right . it is a strange world .
why are there people like frank . why is there so much trouble in this world ?
i do not know . i had a dream . in fact , the night i met you . in the dream the world was dark because there were not any robins . you know , birds . robins stood for love , and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love . and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference . i guess , until the robins come there is trouble .
yeah i guess so . you are a neat girl .
so are you . i mean you are a neat guy . we better get back .
no , silly i am still in school you know . but i will meet you after school and you can tell me what you have learned . you better be careful , jeffrey .
okay , be careful .
can i give you a kiss good night ?
you better not , jeffrey .
okay , okay .
goodnight .
you were late .
i am really sorry .
what am i going to do ?
you want to go talk to him ?
you know , that cheese is practically all chemicals .
that is what makes it so good . you wanta hear what i saw today ?
shoot .
number one . i saw the yellow man go into frank s building , laughing with frank . now , the only trouble is , what does this prove ?
nothing really , but it is interesting . they know each other . they seem to like each other .
maybe . but i think the yellow man is on drugs . i think frank supplies him .
oh yeah ?
number two . i saw the yellow man come out . this time with a well dressed man with an alligator briefcase . they drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance . number three . now get this . in the distance was a murder . a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken .
jeffrey ! !
then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead mangs place .
i cannot believe what you are finding out . are you going to continue with this . are you going back to her apartment ?
yeah .
jeffrey ? why ?
i am seeing something that was always hidden . i am involved in a mystery . i am learning . and it is all secret .
you like mysteries that much ?
you worry about me really ?
great . hey , i have got a bit of a problem . i know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble .
jeffrey , are they important things ? well forget me you have to tell him . jeffrey , i mean it .
everything okay ?
yeah . i think so . i just had to tell him some of what i knew . is friday still on ?
you did not tell him about me ?
i should never had gotten you going on this . yes jeffrey . friday s on !
okay .
what is it ?
what was that all about ?
nothing , really ! it is good to see you .
it is good to see you .
where to ?

i would rather not talk about it . i will tell you about it sometime .
it is okay .

i need il duce .
the duke ? what did you do ?
listen kid , i think you better understand who you are dealing with here .
yeah . i was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him , like he was a ghost or something .
there s ways around that .
lord s name .
mother mary , full of grace .
well listen , i know how my boys take ta scrapping when they take ta drinking .

paraffin came up positive . and bullet holes are usually a big clue .
i cannot find the second one , sir .

look , look ! i am not saying one way or the other . just be careful and go by the protocol on this one .
any tips on where these guys may be ?
ah , agent smecker , we have a problem .

the press is everywhere outside . they are going nuts for these guys . what do you want to do ?
oh , god ! do not kill me ! we are on the same side ! the boss musta sent you in as back up , huh ? oh , shit , please ! i am rocco . i am the funny man . they call me the funny fucking man !
where is your gun ?
chest pocket . shit !
poppa joe said there was only two . in and out . boy , you guys sure did a good job . you are good , huh ? cool masks . where would you get them ?
what did you do ? ! fucking . . . what the fucking fuck ! who the fuck , fucked this fucking ? fuck . how did you two fucking , fucks ? . . . . . . . . . fuck ! ! !
what the fuck are you doing here ? what , huh ! ? what ? what ? what ? answers ! i want fucking answers !
anybody you think is evil ?
yes .
do not you think that is a little psycho ? a little weird ?
climb the corporate ladder , boy . don rocco .
donna s gonna be angry about her cat .
shit . she is on every drug know to man . she would have sold that thing for a dime bag . screw her . but i do kinda feel like an ass hole .
she ai not been around in weeks anyhow .
listen . something s been bothering me about last night .
what ?
well . . . what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there . . . in that room ?
what are you saying ?
think about it man . nine men , six bullets .
you think they sold me out ? no way .
he probably knew you would end up nailing the fat guy , maybe one or two more , but he had to know you were not walking out of there . figure it out . shooter s dead on the scene . no in depth investigation . it would slide right off his back . cause as much as i love ya , you are not exactly don corleone . what would he be losing ? a thirty five year old delivery boy ?
no , no . that is just not the way things are done . besides , how is he know i do not just get in there see there s too many and just serve em their fucking food and beat it ?
he knows you , man . he knows all you want is to move up . that is all . a smooth hitter woulda gone in there , seen it was a wash and slipped out . but a guy like you ? knowing this is your only chance ? waiting eighteen years ?
no . no man . that is . . . that is . . . you do not know what you are talking about . that is bullshit . i know these guys . i mean , thanks for your concern , but that just ai not the thing of it .
do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in .
pack your shit ! we gotta get outta here ! we gotta get out !
what happened ?
what did i fucking do ? . . . in the middle of the lakeview .
anybody see ya ?

i guess we really do not have a system of deciding who .
what the fuck are you doing ?
what ? what is it ?
oh man . you gotta let me do these guys . i am such a moron . i gotta make up for the tit thing .
no way . i have been waiting for this asshole .
you guys gotta teach me that prayer , man . that is some good shit .
forget it . it is a family prayer . my father , his father before him that sort of shit .
who the fuck was he , rocco ? i know you fucking know !
look again for fuck sake !

well , the light caught the side of his face for a second . and it looked like he had a gray beard , maybe . . . late fifties , early sixties .
so you are telling me it was one guy with six guns ? a and he was a senior fucking citizen ?
i think it is better if we find this man before he finds us again .
i will see what i can do . how do i get in touch with you ?
we are going to hit poppa joe tonight , right in the comfort of his own home . then we move on to new york . it is getting a bit hot for us here .

now , that was not too polite , was it ?
how do you think he figured all this out without talking to us ?
i have no idea . maybe someone saw and talked .
german . not in our neighborhood , man . a hundred percent irish . no one talks to cops . period .
absolutely not .
destroy all that which is evil . . .
know what we need , man ? . . . some rope .
for what ?
charlie bronsongs always got rope .
what ?
yeah , these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it .
oh , you have lost it , have not ya ?
i am serious .
me too . that is stupid . name one thing we are gonna need it for .
i do not know they just always need it .
is that right , rambo ?
nervous ?
a bit .
see . i told you there would be a shaft .
where the fuck are you going ?
we will find it . just calm down .
we are doing some serious shit here . now , get a hold of yourself , asshole .
asshole ! ? i am not the rope toting charlie bronson wanna be that is getting us lost !
that was way easier than i thought .
aye .
on tv ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch .
yeah , and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes .
oh , we are good man .
nine bodies .
mafiosos getting caught with kilos and walking on bail the same day .
little girls catching stray bullets in their heads , playing hopscotch in their front yards . and everyone thinks the same thing . . . someone should just go kill those motherfuckers .
where are you going ? did you tell him ?
yes .
who did you kill ?
so what do you think ?
we have teamed up with a sex offender .
give the guy a shot .
there he goes . okay , gentlemen . are we ready to bring this man into the light ? are we ready to truly do the work of the lord ?
that is the guy that got us off the hook with the checkov thing .
he is not to be touched .
now , you will receive us .
we do not ask for your poor or your hungry .
we do not want your tired and sick .
it is your corrupt we claim .
it is your evil , who will be sought by us .
with every breath we shall hunt them down .
each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies .
do not kill , do not rape , do not steal . these are principles which every man of every faith can embrace .
these are not polite suggestions . they are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost .
there are varying degrees of evil . we urge you lesser forms of filth not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption . . . into our domain .
for if you do , there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three . and on that day you will reap it .
i prefer to be called rozengurtle by men .
okay , just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is . . .
rule of thumb ?
yeah ?
i knew you two pricks would give me problems . give me shit cause i am a woman . i am not gonna take your male dominance bullshit !
baumgartner sound irish to you , fuck face ?
holy shit . you are the first one that is ever got that .
and number three , dolly .
uh . . . two shooters !
so , what do we do now ?
she was in here when it went down .
can she i . d . them ?
they were wearing masks .
of course they were . how many ?
only two did the shooting . so what are you thinking , russian retaliation ?
maybe the three of them had something in common .
and it is the same story over here . why the crossover ? theories .
the shooter knew these guys , huh ?
how do you figure ?
no ! fuck you ! you start getting excited ! we gotta fucking go !
what ?
where is my cat ?
i killed your fucking cat , you druggie bitch !
you . . . oh god , why ?
i felt it would bring closure to our relationship !
your what ? ! your fucking what ? !
my , my . . .
your what , bitch ? i will shoot myself in the head , you can tell me that cats name ! go ahead . . . your what ? your precious little . . .
pee . . . per . . . man .
peeperman ? wrong ? what color was it ? ! ! !
it was . . . it was . . .
so what are you thinking here ?
so duffy , got any theories to go with that . . . tie .
these guys were pros . i think they were coming for one target , the fag man , he was the . . .
the what man ?
the fat man .
well , freud was right . so you think they came for the fag man , huh ? and what do you base this upon ?
he was the only one done right . two in the back of the head .
and the pennies ?
new hitman wants to leave his mark
that is a possibility . y know you boston cops are perking up . that is two sound theories in one day , neither of which deal with abnormally sized men . another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent .
yeah . some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead , or silver .
the greeks . the italians .
the two bullets went in here , through the top of the skull , criss crossed and exited through the eyeballs . this one clue tells us three distinct facts . number one . . . duffy .
they shot him at a downward angle . they put him on his knees .
now stay with me , boys . what did they do to make two such identical wounds ? did one guy put him on his knees , pop a cap in , sit him back up and shoot him again the same way ? no . two men of similar height dropped this guy down , each put some iron to his head and boom ! that is all she fucking wrote !
what about one guy with two guns ?
now , what is this going to look like to those who do not know what i just told you ?
it is gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other .
allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry , as i am sure you have never been in one of these places before . a man goes into the booth , puts the money in the slot . the dancer gets it on the other side . she hits the button , door goes up , now there is only glass between you and it is little fireman time .
no way they could have seen it ?
jesus . i just cannot think anymore . that scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out .
what ?
a guy went nuts over off of commonwealth today . shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight . fled the scene . do not have much on him .
these two fucking scenes are related . too many coincidences . same day ? five hours apart ? dead mobsters on both scenes . now , why did he kill the bartender ?
crime of passion . he just went nuts . he would have shot everyone in here . he just ran out of bullets .
duffy . this look like a fucking post office to you ? this guy came in here with intent . maybe he did not know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea . the bartender was not a fucking accident .
well , we did not get any help on that . a lot of people saw it . nobody s talking .
that is one big fucking shoe ! . . . and think about it . of all the ways to kill a guy , crushing him to death . that is very particular . you do not get many of those . i dunno . i feel something big here . i would not be surprised if we see more of these turning up .
brilliant . so now we got a huge guy theory and serial crusher theory . top fucking notch . that is your name ?
who the . . .
twist of lemon !
chief , what the fuck is this ?
he is struck again , has not he , greenly ?
why do you always disrespect me like that ?
how many bodies , greenly ?
while greenly s getting coffee , anybody else want anything ?
uh . shit , i , uh . . .
after talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth . after she watches them whack him , she passes out . why the two extra victims ?
witness ?
they were not related . the guy used a . no pennies . totally amateur .
who were the victims ?
a couple of peons for the mob and . . .
what if it was just one guy with six guns ?
what the . . . ?
oh my god !
oh , she is quite proud of herself .
it is only here boys so i got lot s more drinking ta do with your worthless relatives down at the anvil .
but he is been having himself a nip or two as well . . . been up the waitress skirt all night , poor girl .
promise me boys .
right now .
this is some heavy shit . this is like lone ranger heavy man . fuck it ! there s so much shit that pisses me off . you guys should recruit cause i am sick and fucking tired of walking down the street waiting for one of these assholes to get me , y know ?
hallelujah , jaffar .
well fuck , you guys could do this every day .
you fucking guys . you ruined me . i am fucking done . permanent package boy .
who says that ? you could take credit on it .
what are you serious ?
hey . you do not know that shit for sure .
oh , jesus . you are such a fucking retard !
fuck you !

those rat fucks ! all of them were all laughing at me man !
liberating is not it ?
vincenzo , that fat motherfucker , yakavetta s right hand . he is the one who set me up . then he went around shooting his mouth off , telling everyone i was as good as dead . he goes in there every wednesday night around , he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer . never misses .
so ?
well , truth be known , those first ones just kinda fell into our laps .
you look like mush mouth from fat albert .
worst day of my life , man .
well he sure as fuck knew you !
shit ! . . . shit ! he ai not here .
what the fuck do you mean ?
you bet your ass he will .
hey ! we gotta talk about this early morning church shit .
we will keep going , roc .
hello ? you there ?
why have you come to a church for council if you are not religious ?
why have i come to a church ? i never have before . i guess i just . . . felt i should .
what is it my son ?
it is ethics . i put evil men behind bars , but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these . . . cocksuckers to slip through . i have found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist . as if they have god s permission . but what they do is wrong and i should arrest them . . . technically .
but in this day and age i believe what they do is . . . necessary . i feel it is . . . correct .
you believe ?
yes .
you feel ?
yes .
has he now ?
you have entered the house of the lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings . is it so much to believe that god has brought you here ?
i guess not .
you are right .
those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision .
i want to stand for what i believe in , father .
then you must find out what your beliefs are .
i believe these young men are right .
you know them personally ?
yes .
do you think they would harm an innocent man , for any reason ?
the laws of god are higher than the laws of man .
yes ! yes ! i was thinking that , too . no . i was feeling it . all i needed was to hear you say it ! amen ! i will help them .
forgive me father .
you gonna do what i say , got it ?
yes .
i am sorry you are gonna hafta see this . do not look at me !
i am sorry , i am sorry . i did not see .
do not do this my son .
open it !
have you no fear of god ?
father , i will do you right here .
do your thing father . do not fuck this up .
what do you want me to say ?
just be natural , goddamit .
i would not have , uh , killed you , father . dominus ominus . remember , you are bound . you cannot talk about this . . . to anyone .
poppa joe , you want me to go now ?
hey , rocco , wait . come back here .
i always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh . they always come around telling me what a crack up you are . what is it they call you ?
the . . . the funny man .
the funny man . well , i got a new job for you , just for now . roc , i am having a real shitty day . i am depressed . tell me a funny story or a joke .
uh . okay . . . um . . . you hear the one about the , no fuck that one . . . uh . . . oh ! oh ! well . . . shit . okay , there s a white guy . he is walking along the beach and he finds a , a pot , y know and ah , he rubs it and this genie pops out . but this genie , he is a ni . . . he is a black guy .
he is a nigger .
continue the joke .
well , it is the funny man . give it here , package boy .
joey bevo said it was important . said i had to give it to him myself .
i am rocco . i am the funny man . heee hee . i am so fucking funny . hee hee .
fuck you vincenzo .
tell me a joke funny man . hee hee .
what color hair does he have ?
black hair . paul michael glaser .
making hutch david soul ?
right . the blond guy .
ok . that is wrong .
dignan , it is
plus where is huggie bear ?
he is not there . huggie bear is not in every single episode .
i think you might of dreamed this one , anthony .
why ?
as part of his plan . i do not know why .
see , that is what i am saying . it has the logic of a dream .
the point is the killer always goes , may i speak to starsky ? he says his name .
what does starsky say ?
he says . this is he .
this is he ?
did you see what i meant about the window ?
kind of . except we have already got the keys .
that is true . but what if they change the locks ?
would they do that ?
now that window can never be locked . it is impossible .
she is really kind of hot .
it is got a v , dignan .
anthony , we will get two hundred for the coin collection alone . that is less than what it is appraised at .
but dignan , do you really know that much about rare coins ?
the list , dignan . i know you remember the list because you signed it . things dignan was not supposed to touch .
every valuable item in the house was on that list .
that does not make any difference . i bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday . they have a very special value for her .
yeah , but i cannot be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary . there s just not time for it .
where are you going ?
i do not appreciate you ridiculing me .
how was i ridiculing you ?
you are making fun of my family . you know there s nothing to steal from my mom and craig . you know exactly what you are saying .
did you see that ?
yeah , i saw it .
i am lookout .
dignan , it is got an alarm .
i do not think so . just reach on in .
that sets it off .
it had an alarm .
yeah , i heard that .
holy shit . what would i tell you ?
eight dollars .
but he did not say anything .
is it back in ?
loop around real fast .
ok . escape route . the most important thing you can have is an escape route . just in case somebody s tailing us . or even chasing us , as the case may be
you think we are going to be chased ?
now . one thing we need to discuss is timing . timing is absolutely crucial . what are you doing ? anthony !
anthony , give me the fucking gun !
dignan , calm down .
you are out ! i am not working with either one of you !
calm down . take a deep breath .
where is the manager ?
where is the other stocker ?
there s another stocker , right ?
is that the manager ?
holy shit .
what about what that guy said ?
i swear to god . in a very quiet voice .
like he meant it .
yeah .
like he would find dignan . one day .
that is wrong with him ?
what do you think ?
anthony , he sat in the car and watched a in progress . he got what he deserved .
he was the driver , dignan . he did what he is supposed to do .
i did not realize you were so sensitive to bob s feelings . considering i did the plans , you are actually lucky you got
can i get that credit card from you ?
i do not like to use that credit card , dignan .
why not ?
because my mom gets the bill .
she is not going to notice , anthony .
i do not want to use it .
well , then cut it in half .
i keep it for emergencies .
see if mine are in there .
dignan , those are not running shoes .
yes , they are .
look at the treads on those .
what about them ?
they obviously were not designed for racing .
really . ok , dad . but seriously , anthony . these are fast shoes .
you have never had a pair of fast shoes in your life , dignan . in fifth grade dignan used to wear cowboy boots for p . e .
that is real cool , anthony . yeah , i wore boots . my parents would not buy me any running shoes like yours . i was not spoiled .
do not call me spoiled , dignan .
i will just say it .
i will say it .
ok . go ahead .
you owe me fifty bucks .
look , man . she did not know anything about shirts .
no , i am not saying her . i am just saying , i do not know .
armored trucks are very difficult to steal , anthony .
i know . but once you get inside you are home free .
right . get back to me on that one . once your plan is worth a shit .
it is not a plan . it is just
actually . if you knew the exact route , you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over .
yeah , but you would not have the truck if you blew it up .
dignan , i cannot get my hair cut . that is just not possible , all right ?
no , dignan . i am sorry . i cannot do that .
i thought you guys went to get your hair cut .
this is inez . carmen . anita .
hi .
inez , this is
may i have a word with you , please ?
what the fuck is going on here ?
what . that is the matter ?
anthony , we are on the run from the law here . did you tell these people your real name ?
no . i did not . dignan , they do not speak english .
they do not ?
no . not really . inez speaks a little .
which one was that ?
she is from cuba .
he needs to hire an attorney .
now that makes sense . we will hang out for a couple of days . get a little r r . make sure future mangs ok and then get back on the road .
as long as he gets out ok .
obviously . that is a given .
see , now we have got a plan .
see , one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor mr . langstongs house and anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious . i had to dive in and save him .
this was in fourth grade .
mr . langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation . cpr . i have never said this before , but frankly i thought anthony was dead . the veins in his face were all sticking out . his skin was blue . he truly did look dead .
after that my parents never let me go to dignangs again .
but if it was not for dignan i probably would of died .
he is gone . he stole the car .
where was it parked ?
that coward . son of a bitch .
maybe he just went to the store .
he went back for his brother .
we said hours .
when would he tell you ?
this morning .
where was i ?
you were asleep .
he told you and you let him do it .
he told me because he wanted to know if i wanted to go .
if you wanted to go ? what were you going to do ? just leave me here by myself ?
well , i did not do it , did i ?
so when you were saying bob s at the store and acting real surprised , that was just an act . you were just
bob went to help his brother . i understand that and i cannot help it if you do not .
i understand that if i had a few more friends like you and bob i would be dead .
if you would gone with bob you would probably be in weatherford by now . of course i would be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped .
i did not realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself , dignan .
we are going over to this bar if you feel like going .
why do not you come with us .
i cannot believe he just jumped you .
i wish i would been there .
man . i am sorry . we just went for a walk
i do not really feel like talking about it . the only thing i feel like is getting the fuck out of this place .
i have an idea for that .
what ?
inez has a master key to all these rooms , does not she ? does not she ?
i do not think we can do that .
i know we can . it is real simple . we go into a room , grab some car keys and
what i am saying is she would not go for that .
she does not need to know .
i do not know , dignan . i just
look . i am ready to get the fuck out of here . it is real torture for me to be here . getting the shit kicked out of me by mexicans .
shh .
no one to back me up . now i have a good idea . so unless you come up with something better
i do not think we need any keys , dignan . i think i can hotwire a car for us .
you do not know how to hotwire .
yes , i do . bob taught me .
bob taught you how to get electrocuted .
i think we better go home .
do not panic , anthony .
i am not . but there s
you cannot just run home every time things get tough . first of all , we have got enough dough to
our money situation is not good .
you are so spoiled . what is not good to you ? only a few hundred
we have got sixteen dollars .
sixteen dollars .
i know .
i had to give some to inez .
how much ?
you gave to the goddamn housekeeper ! what the fuck is your problem ?
she needed it .
a tip ! for the housekeeper !
her name s inez . stop calling her the housekeeper .
that is what she is !
i know that . but
you are in love with the fucking housekeeper !
shut up !
when would you get back ?
who s in the car ?
that is applejack . you want to meet him ?
applejack would of got him anyway . this was just the quicker way .
i want you to look at this .
what is it ?
it is big , anthony . real big . it is called hinckley cold storage .
mr . henry has an inside source . we call him steve . that is where we get our information .
who s mr . henry ?
what exactly is this place ? freezers ?
what time did he say to be here ?
you could give somebody a concussion .
what do you think ?
dignan . take it easy .
he does not want to fight .
get out of the way .
no fighting . it was not bob s fault .
shit , dignan .
what the fuck are we doing out here ?
i do not know , dignan . you went crazy .
ok . man in blue jeans just left by southwest door . he is entering a white van . what time is it ?
eleven fifteen .
ok . mark that down .
god . is not this great ? working on the job . got a wheel man . got a safecracker . good friends with mr . henry .
yeah . it is pretty good .
next week we will be drinking pia coladas .
or i might end up with a broken nose .
i will try not to hold you back tomorrow .
i do not think you will .
i do not want to be too much of a liability .
look , you are going to do fine . it is ok to be scared .
he was a nice guy .
do you like inez ?
as a person ?
yeah . as a girl .
yes . i do .
bird dog to scarecrow . bird dog to scarecrow .
go ahead , bird dog .
you are all clear .
roger .
we all set ?
uh huh ?
take your second position .
i am in position , scarecrow .
any activity ?
not at all . the place is totally deserted .
good . it is supposed to be .
i have got a great view up here . i can see all the
i do not know .
that is happening ? that is going on ?
who did that ? what the fuck is that ?
it is going back down .
freeze !
nobody move !
help me move him .
who tripped the alarm ?
it is the fire alarm . somebody pulled the fire alarm .
where is kumar ?
i do not know .
what are you doing ?
wait for kumar .
you are kidding .
come on .
i will see you there .
what ?
i will see you there .
what are you talking about ?
i will get him .
there s not enough time .
dignan , it is too late .
like amnesia .
so is mr . henry going to come by and see me or anything ?
i do not think so . i mean . actually , he robbed bob s house .
he did ?
yeah .
you got to be kidding me .
i am not kidding .
what would he get ?
pretty much everything .
you think applejack knew ?
why ?
mr . henry never gave you a test , did he ?
what do you mean ?
you are living on a sailboat ?
it belongs to bob s uncle .
how big is it ?
where ?
does it float ?
so how is it in there ?
that is he in for ?
i think i may have found a way out of here .
you are kidding .
no . i am not .
how ?
shhh . wait for my instructions .
when we go through the next gate you will have seconds to take out the tower guard .
what ?
have the car running at the north west checkpoint . bob and i will
scale the barricade and tunnel through no mangs land . and bob . remember
scale the
this is my business manager , rowboat .
nice to meet you .
that is a sharp jacket .
it is hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle .
you know , your form is for shit , but you have got a hell of a talent .
every once in a while some cat comes to me . he wants to know how i made it . how did i become a success ? the first thing i tell them is follow your instincts . let your instincts guide you . the second thing i tell them is , for christ s sake you got to know your grammar .
you mean like techniques ?
i would like to live in that place . hinckley cold storage .
you mean a safecracker ?
look at that woman . she is what ? fifty ? fifty five ? but she has not let herself go . i appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body .
tell me something . what the hell kind of name is dignan ?
i am not really sure . i think it is irish . or maybe
i guess what i am trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this dignan ?
what do you mean what kind of person ? he is a good person .
sure , sure . he is a great person , and i would call bullshit on anybody who said differently . but i wonder if the kid has the goods up here .
i do not think you are giving him enough credit . i know sometimes he does not think an idea through . he gets too excited . but
and you are wrong if you think , i would turn my back on a friend .
congratulations . you passed the test .
what do you mean ?
that was a test ?
how does that feel ?
did dignan take the test ?
yes , he did .
well , he agreed that bob should be dropped . and he also agreed you were a liability . but he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses .
i will tell you , anthony . times like this i get philosophical . what does it mean ? that is it all about ? are you afraid to die ?
me ?
no , that door over there .
i do not want to die .
are you afraid ?
yeah . i mean , i do not think about it all the time . but once in awhile i kind of go , woah . man .
exactly . woah .
death .
the fear of death , the pain of consciousness . did you mix this martini ?
no . bob did .
bob . bob . that is a palindrome . i love palindromes .
are you afraid to die , mr . henry ?
this is good .
but you are thieves . it is what you are .
yeah .
we are renegades from despair .
can i ask you something , mr . henry ?
absolutely .
why would you want to help us ?
future man .
who ?
did you ever steal a car before ?
what do herbs have to do with it ? i do not understand the
in your backyard ? how do you protect them ?
it is private property . plus i have hector .
hector woud not do anything .
could you grow cinnamon ?
i do not know . sure , i guess .
let them fight .
are you serious ?
see you .
you will probably have them the rest of your life .
what the fuck is dignan doing with that cop ? he loves them .
there s a million places to hide around here .
oh , yeah . they will never catch the guy .
i hope not .
where you going ?
why do not you just tell them the truth . those belong to my neighbor phil .
i do not know . i personally do not need that shit in my life right now .
will you guys shut up ? god . it is like having two little kids in the car .
you think he got my license plates ?
how long are they going to hold him ?
anthony , i
what ?
bob , where you going ?
i am not playing any more golf .
why not ?
cause i am not getting any better . it is a waste of time .
you have only been playing for two weeks , bob . it takes a long time to learn this game .
you think i am improving ?
you do not have to talk about it if you do not want to .
no , i do not mind .
i know it must of been a bad experience . but it does not sound like it was your fault .
it took six months of research . i did all the wiring myself . switched ac to dc . doubled the voltage . shorted out the generator . the whole school was shut down .
that is pretty complicated for a senior prank .
at first they were going to charge me with manslaughter . that is partly why i was in custody so long . sixty days .
sixty days ?
yeah . one minute you are studying great expectations and the next minute you are drawing the holy mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend .
why were you drawing the holy mary ?
i thought he did not have to pay anything because of the technicality .
yeah , but he still has the aggravation . three days sitting in a cell .
were you adopted , bob ?
why do you say that ?
well , because you guys do not look alike .
was future man adopted ?
let s not even talk about it .
yeah . let s keep it
give him a second .
you ok , bob ?
no , i am having a heart attack . of course , i am ok . that is that supposed to mean ?
no , i know . i am just saying . i feel fine . you want a piece of cake ?
what are you doing ?
my walkie talkie s busted . i cannot tell that is going on .
let me see it . did you drop it ?
jesus , bob .
yeah .

it is in the driveway .
how do you say nineteen ?
dies y nueve .
are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms ?
no .
were you born in mexico ?
cuba .
does my skin feel soft , anthony ?
what ? what ?
like silk ?
nice to meet you , applejack .
you are anthony ?
yeah .
did you ever hear of the s . cooper trust robbery ?
uh uh .
s . cooper trust , in san francisco ?
let s go , abdul shabazz .
i can knock a man out with a six inch punch .
what do you mean ?
where would they come from ?
the front stairs .
there s a lot of valuable shit in there , applejack . the silver and the china . the crystal . and the grandfather clock . goddammit , i bet that clock s worth ten grand .
why the fuck do we need to blow up the car ? it does not make any goddamn sense .
just settling an old score . you might say revenge .
that sounds like a lot of bullshit that will land us in jail .
we might have to take that chance . cause i feel pretty strongly about this .
is that him ?
that is anthony .
that is your friend anthony ?
yeah .
that is he doing here ?
wait . did he see us ?
mr . henry pulled that job in . it is famous . applejack was the wheel man . did you use this same car , applejack ?
i do not know why the fuck we are having a party . the damn job s not over yet .
well , this is not really a party per se .
you do not celebrate til it is over .
what ?
are you a fag ?
dignan and anthony , this is little richard . he is crazy . totally nuts .
i do not know about that .
little richard . trust me . you are insane . jesus , this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk . you do not want a guy like that loose on the streets .
it seemed like a good idea at the time .
well , what do you think ?
i am not allowed to drive those .
not even for emergencies ?
no .
i thought your parents were in italy .
they are .
so who s going to know ?
he looks like he was designed by scientists . for desert warfare .
that never would of
if you are that worried , maybe we should just steal one .
what are you talking about , bob ?
you stole a trans am .
yes . i did .
ok , bob .
it is true , dignan .
well . what do you want to do ? you want to steal one or just drive your car ?
how much could you grow ? realistically .
as much as i want . when these plants bud i will probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed .
six thousand dollars ? come on , bob .
if it is that easy why does not everybody grow them ?
do not you guys tell anybody about my plants .
you are paranoid , bob .
what was that all about ?
i cannot believe you said that .
what did i say ?
the guy is fucking insane .
i warned you , dignan .
you said it like it was a big joke , bob . like he is wild .
no , i was saying crazy like a lunatic .
i know that now . he is a fucking psycho .
well , do not blame me . i told you .
where would she go ?
i think we might of scared her .
i am going to take a look at this .
hang on . this is important , bob . anthony and i are responsible for the internal situation . the money and the people . you are responsible for the external situation . the streets and the getaway .
that is my responsibility .
that is your domain .
bob .
i am paying attention . i just want to look at it for a minute .
that is your fucking problem ? you are a shithead !
i paid for it .
he does not get it . held never understand what we are trying to accomplish here . it is too dangerous for him .
well , in reality it is not that dangerous , bob . it is only dangerous if you do not know what you are doing .
you know , bob , anthony did kill someone . he electrocuted our janitor senior year .
he electrocuted someone ?
it was an accidental . i do not want to go into the details . it was just one of those senior pranks that did not really go right . i mean , obviously , since swifty s dead . that is why anthony never graduated .
his name was swifty ?
yeah . one of the nicest old guys you would ever know .
that is too bad .
what are you doing ?
what happened ?
shhh . slow down , bob . drive natural .
this is natural .
that is good . keep it at forty .
did we get it ?
how much is there ?
was dignan screaming like , get me a bag !
you really think he will remember you ?
bob , will you please listen ?
i mean , jesus christ , bob . you did not have some vicious lunatic screaming , i am going to remember you !
that is true . that would give me nightmares .
way to go , bob !
i told you they were there .
in all probability nothing would of happened . but why take the chance ? that is why i ran . i mean how many plants were even back there ? five ? ten ?
shit , bob . what the fuck did you do that for ?
is he chasing us ?
i am sure he did . we will have to get new plates .
it is registered in my mother s name .
what the fuck possessed you ?
bob . are you coming ?
you can go first , bob .
my brother s in jail .
the weed .
but it is not his . how can they arrest future man ?
i do not think they can make it stick , bob . i mean , what do they actually have on future man ?
well , the marijuana crop is a good start .
that could be anybody s .
they also found my two beam scale in the garage .
since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house ? everybody has a scale .
the cops say it is a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana .
so tell them the truth . what do you use it for ?
how long has he been in there ?
i do not know .
then how come they have not set the bail yet ? that is unconstitutional .
what do you mean get back ?
well , obviously , we got to go back .
bob , that makes no sense .
dignan , he is my brother . i cannot just leave him there .
this could be a trap .
come on , dignan .
do not come on , dignan me .
i am going back .
not in that car you are not .
watch me .
give me the keys , dignan .
i cannot do that , bob .
dignan . you are going to give me those keys or you are going to get hurt .
do not threaten me , bob .
future man would never go to jail for you , i will tell you that .
his name s not future man , dignan .
i know it is not .
you do not even know his name .
yes , i do .
what is it ?
just get in the car , bob .
that is his name ?
it is not your decision and he is not your brother , dignan .
you have got a beautiful walk , bob .
dignan .
hey , dignan . how is it going ?
not bad .
come on in . what you been up to ?
it is too bad about what happened on the road .
right . it was extremely stupid .
i do not expect an apology and i do not even want one . i just want us to
i cannot fucking believe this guy . an apology , bob ?
you said hours !
i never agreed to that .
bob , you are lying !
bullshit .
come on !
it was not your fault , bob . you had your brother .
i am sorry , bob .
that is ok .
come on , bob .
i know it , man . hang on .
scarecrow ?

yeah . we are in the elevator . how is it look back there ?
it looks pretty good . there s nobody back here .
i could not hear anything .
that is wrong with applejack ?
he is having a heart attack or something .

jesus christ . what the fuck is that ?
i did not think there was an alarm .
the elevator broke .
where is applejack ?
applejack drove .
i said to the da , that cop who hit me must of given me crs disease .
that is that ?
do you have your own room ?
we do not have rooms , bob . we have cells .
do you have your own cell ?

i would appreciate it if you did not go around telling people lies about me .
how you doing , bob ?

he said what ?
he said you ran away from home .

social issues . crime prevention .
ground defense .
dignan . good to see you . good to see you applejack . who are you ?

where is that guy going ?
he left his sweater .
well , i left some money in there .

mr . henry ?
come on in !
it is locked .
john mapplethorpe . how are you . hi .
the world needs dreamers , son .
what ?
well , we will see you later , bob .
pleasure to meet you , john .
you told me bourne was dead .
there was a mistake .
i will say . you killed his goddam girlfriend instead . now they are onto neski . they are at the brecker hotel even as we speak .
will it track back to us ?
no . the files are spotless . whatever they find , it is just going to make conklin look worse .
and the landy woman ?
she is done everything i wanted . she bit on conklin so fast it was laughable . she even found his bogus swiss account . . .
neski was a roadblock . without me , there s no company , no fortune . you owe me , uri . one last push .
leaving was a business decision . we are both rich , come enjoy it .
what do you mean ?
go to the airport . get a plane . i will have a brass band waiting for you .
save it for bourne .
he left yesterday on the night train . he is probably just getting in now . you will have to hurry .
treadstone .
never heard of it .
that is not gonna fly .
and what are we looking for ?
i want to know about treadstone .
to know about it ? it was a kill squad . black on black . closed down two years ago . nobody wants to know about treadstone . not around here . you better take this back to marty and make sure he knows what you are doing .
let s talk about conklin .
what are you after , pam ? you want to fry me ? you want my desk ? is that it ?
i want to know what happened .
what happened ? jason bourne happened . you have got the files ? then let s cut the crap . it went wrong . conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap . bourne was his number one guy went out to work , screwed the op and never came back . conklin could not fix it , could not find bourne , could not adjust . it all went sideways . finally there were no options left .
so you had conklin killed . i mean , if we are cutting the crap . . .
i have given thirty years and two marriages to this agency . i have shoveled shit on four continents . i am due to retire next year and believe me , i need my pension , but if you think i am gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this , you can go to hell . marshall too . it had to be done .
and bourne ? where is he now ?
dead in a ditch ? drunk in a bar in mogadishu ? who knows ?
. . . ivan mevedev senior financial manager worked for one of the new russian petroleum companies , pecos oil . he claimed to know where the money landed . we believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the agency . . . this . . .
. . . this is conklings computer .
. . . at the time of his death , conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven hundred and sixty thousand dollars .
do you know what his budget was ?
excuse me .
we were throwing money at him . throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark .
may i finish ?
conklin might have been a nut , but he was not a mole . you have me his calendar for a couple of days , i will prove he killed lincoln . this is supposed to be definitive ?
that is definitive , is that i just lost two people in berlin !
berlin !
i have already got a team there . i doubt bourne s in naples to settle down and raise a family .
you do not know what you are getting into here .
call a mayday into berlin station . we need snipers , dod , whatever they got . snipers ?
hold on he said he wants to come in .
my ass he does . you are playing with fire , pamela . marshall said nail him to the wall . i do not know how you interpreted that , but i do not think he meant repatriate him .
do not you want answers ?
so that is he doing ? you believe him ?
it is hard to swallow . the confusion the amnesia but he keeps on killing ? it is more calculated than sick . what about nicky ? she is the last one to see bourne in paris . she is the one he asks for . they disappear . . .
sorry to wake you .
what ?
they found danny zorngs body . dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time .
oh , god . . . it must have been bourne .
did he say anything to you ?
moscow ? what the hell s he going to moscow for ?
do not know .
jesus . . . i , zorn . . . i have to call his family . tell them . . .
sit down .
i would rather stand if it is all the same to you .
i do not exactly know what to say i am sorry .
why would be enough for me .
i am not a traitor . i have served my ountry .
and pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it .
why not ? it was just money .
and danny zorn , what was that ?
had to be done .
no good options left ?
in the end , honestly , it is hubris . simple hubris . you reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are .
no . you lost your way .
sir . . .
she say what time i should call ?
i did my box work , but i wanted to show you before i showed landy . i came out here last night because none of this was making any sense . i mean , i am with you on this , conklin was a nut , but a traitor ? i just cannot get there .
what do you have , danny ?
you put a four gam kel on here and it is gonna take out power to the building . you know that . what you cannot know , is if it is gonna blow the room with it .
and ?
there were two charges , they were supposed to go off simultaneously . the second one , the one that did not go off , was down here . . . first of all , this is nothing , it is a sub line for the breaker above . second , why put the charge all the way down here ? if you are good enough to get in here and handle the gear , you are good enough to know you do not need this . bourne would know .
it was staged ?
is it a slam dunk ? no , but . . .
jesus . . .
okay . what if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming conklin and bourne . what if bourne did not have anything to do with this ?
keep going . . .
something s been going on here in europe . and it is still going on . post conklin . who s been in berlin ?
lots of people . . .
who else knows about this ?
nobody . you . i had to tell you , right ?
show me again . . .
sit . can you . . . the chair . have the chair .
of all the people in the world , you are the only one i have anything to offer . that is why i came here .
it is nice . does this picture mean anything to you ? hmm ?
it is nothing . it is just a picture .
no . it is because you do not know how they died .
i would want to know . i would want to know that my mother did not kill my father . i would want to know that she did not kill herself .
it changes things . that knowledge . does not it ?
yes . . .
that is not what happened to your parents .
then what ?
it was my job . my first time . your father was supposed to be alone . but then your mother , she came out of nowhere . . . i had to change my plan . you understand me ? you do not have to live like that anymore . thinking that .
they loved you . and i killed them .
how . . . how can . . . how can you be here and say this ?
it does not matter . your life is hard enough .
you are a liar .
you know i am not .
you are a liar !
i should kill you . . . if it is true you should die . . . i should kill you now !
i cannot let you do that either .
because you are afraid !
i have to go now .
is this really happening ?
i emptied it .
felt a little light .
front . use your teeth .
you still should have moved .
so why did not you kill me then ?
what do you want ?
conklin .
try again .
you are lying . if it is over , why are they after me ?
i do not know .
who sent you to greece ?
a voice . a voice from the states . someone new .
pamela landy ?
i do not know who that is .
that is going on in berlin ?
she really did that ? told you not to kill me ? i had a woman once . but after a while , what do you talk about ? i mean , for us . the work . you cannot tell them who you are . . .
you called it in ?
i am sorry .
car keys ?
my coat but we should
what ?
where were you , jason ? in the car .
conklin up front .
i will get the book .
no . there s nothing new .
you are sure ? we should still we should write it down .
two years we are scribbling in a notebook
it has not been two years
we write them down because sooner or later you are going to remember something good .
i am trying , marie , okay ?
i worry when you get like this .
it is just a nightmare .
sleep . sleep now .
i should be better by now .
you are better . and i think it is not memories at all . it is just a dream you keep having over and over .
but it ends up the same .
no . . . how ?
the telegraph office .
but we were so careful .
but you are sure ?
he was at the campground yesterday .
so . . .
that is crazy .
no . not this . this is real . and he is right there . . .
where
. . . but you are not you are not sure . . .
we cannot wait to be sure .
i do not want to move again . . . i like it here .
look , we clear out , we get to the shack , we get safe . we hang there awhile . i will come back . i will check it out . but right now we cannot
where is left to go ?
you drive .
what ?
switch ! you drive !
where ?
jesus ! is he back there ?
not yet
it is just him ?
yeah one guy i do not think he was ready
you keep going to the shack . i will meet you there in an hour .
where are you going ?
i am going to bail on the other side and wait . this bridge is the only way he can follow .
what if it is not who you think it is ?
if he crosses the bridge , it is .
there must be another way !
i warned them , marie . i told them to leave us alone .
jason , please do not do this . . . it will not ever be over like this .
i love you , too .
i wanted to kill him .
but you found another choice .
i did .
it would not have changed the way you feel .
i know it is a dream .
you do ?
god , i miss you . i do not know what to do without you .
see that tram coming around the corner ?
yes .
i did . . . jason , i swear , i did . . . i told them . . . i told them i believed you . . .
who is pamela landy ?
you hear me ? i believed you .
why is she trying to kill me ?
how do they know that ? how can they know any of that ?
what is this , a game ?
say it .
last week an agency field officer went to make a buy from a russian national .
a russian ?
it was pamela landy s op . the guy was going to sell out a mole or something . i have not been debriefed on exactly what it was .
and you got to him before we could .
i killed him ? ? ?
you left a print ! there was kel that did not go off ! there was a partial print , they tracked it back to treadstone ! they know it is you !
what was landy buying ? what kind of files ? what was she buying ?
why are you here , then ?
please i am only here because of paris because they cannot figure out what you are doing i am here because of abbott
abbott ?
he closed down treadstone he took care of me after paris . . .
so when was i here ?
what do you mean ?
for treadstone . in berlin . you know my file . i did a job here . when ?
no . you never worked berlin .
my first job .
your first assignment was geneva .
that is a lie !
no . . . jason . . . please . . .
i was here !
it is me .
what do you want ?
okay , how do you want to do it ?
i want someone i know to take me in .
who ?
okay , jason , your move .
where am i ?
oh , shit . . .
why am i alive ?
thank you for your gift . i am sorry about marie .
that is that ?
do not need it . i remember everything .
sounds like a threat .
you did not answer my question .
we need to get in there .
so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines . one of them failed . the fingerprint . . . that is from the one that did not go off .
looks like he is been detained .
who s going ? us ?
there s only a consulate , they sent a field officer out half an hour ago
kurt s reopening all the wyfi and sat links
go take the van !
maybe he just needed a place to spend the night ?
alright . . . take it down .
what ?
we will know for sure when we get the security tapes .
you are sure ?
what ? the tapes ?
show me .
here ?
this is everything ? is there .
who ? who else is here ?
no ! not me ! no other people !
i am here . so is donnie and jack weller . we understand you are using the full allocation for this buy ?
that is where we came out .
it is a lot of money , pam .
we are talking raw , unprocessed kgb files . it is not something we can go out and comparison shop .
still . . .
okay , cut to the chase , pam . what are you selling ?
mr . nevins ?
who s this ?
how long have you worked for the agency ?
me ? four years .
i want that area secured , i want any evidence secured and i want it done now . is that clear ? ?
yes , sir ma am . . .
what kind of problems ?
depression . anger . compulsive behaviors . they had physical symptoms headaches sensitivity to light
amnesia ?
good luck .
i am curious about bourne . your interpretation of his condition . you have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions ?
am i a doctor , no , but . . .
are you an expert in amnesia ?
look , what do you want me to say ? i was there . i believed him .
believed what ?
i believed jason bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown .
so he fooled you .
if you say so .
not good enough . you are the person who floated this amnesia story . ever feel sorry for him ? for what he would been through ?
you are making it out like we are friends here or something . i met him alone twice .
you felt nothing ? no spark ? two young people in paris ? dangerous missions ? life and death ?
you mean , did i want a date ?
did you ?
these were killers . conklin had them all jacked up . they were dobermans .
some women like dobermans
what do you want from me ? i was reassigned . i am out .
i do not think we need to keep looking for him anyway .
and why is that ?
is it fresh ?
what do you think ? is he coming in ?
i do not know . he was sick . he wanted out . i believed him .
let s give him half an hour .
so ?
do we know what this says ?
yup . . . the main word there , the file heading , translates as treadstone .
anything ?
no . munich s a bust . he is loose .
black coat , possibly leather . dark slacks . dark t shirt . he says they are gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there , and then check them out , but . . .
here s what i have got . remember vladimir neski ? russian politician ? seven years ago , he was due to speak to a group of european oil ministers here at the hotel . he never did . he was murdered .
by who ?
his wife . in room . then she shot herself .
we are looking at all berlin outbound . good news is , every train station in berlin has thirty to forty fixed , digital security cameras . common feed .
are we hacking or asking ?
yes . in that order .
someone dead from this household ?
we just had a funeral , is not that what it means in england as well ?
what it means in england and in scotland too is that rebels have forfeited their lands . we were ambushed last night . but the scots dragged their dead away .
my brother and nephew perished two days ago , when their hay cart turned over .
then we will just have a peek at the wounds . dig em up !
we will sleep here tonight . you will come home with me . we will let the house , and the lands too plenty of willing neighbors .
i do not want to leave .
did the priest say anything about the resurrection ? or was it all about judgment ?
it was in latin , sir .
what are they doing ?
but . . . what will you do ?
i will invade england . and defeat the english on their own ground .
a thousand . you have made me guardian of scotland . so i tell you this is what we face .
we must sue for peace .
peace ? !
we cannot defeat this
with cavalry not heavy , like the english , but light , fast horsemen , like you nobles employ we could outmaneuver their bowmen !
sir william . we come to seek a meeting .
you have all sworn to longshanks .
an oath to a liar is no oath at all . an oath to a patriot is a vow indeed . every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you .
so let the council swear publicly .
i will meet you , but only one way if robert the bruce is there , and puts his hand on my bible , and swears his loyalty to scotland .
young robert , we are honored
my father hears that longshanks has granted prima noctes .
a wise plan . and how is your father ? we have missed him at the council .
does anyone know his politics ?
may he rest in peace . . . you have already sealed the coffin ?
he was a modest man .
if i pay homage to another s throne , then how am i a king ?
homage is nothing . it is the crown that matters !
the crown is that of scotland . and scotland is william wallace .
he will not come .
longshanks promised !
scottish rebels have routed lord bottoms !
what news of the north ?
nothing new , majesty . we have sent riders to speed any word .
while i am in france fighting to expand your future kingdom i learn that stirling castle is lost , our entire northern army wiped out ! and you have done nothing ? !
wallace has sacked york !
the weapon has been outlawed by the pope himself !
now we kill two birds at one stroke . we recruit from scotland for our armies in france .
the scots will fight for us ?
what choice do they have ? now they must serve us or starve .
but if we have not caught wallace
his legend grows ! it will be worse than before !
what is it ? !
you directed me to report to you the moment the king s conference was ended .
so i did ! and what was so important about it ?
shut up , would you ! how can i concentrate ? !
. . . his majesty was quite keen that you should understand
no , m lord .
now , my flower , do you understand ?
yes . i had thought that . . . i was loathsome to you . perhaps i am . if i may be excused , m lord .
good day to you , m lords .
you mock us with a smile ?
i am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries . all of england shudders with the news of renewed rebellion .
wallace s followers .
the little cow is insane
is it true ? wallace is captured ?
simply because he eluded your trap , do you think he is more than a man ? my father is dying . perhaps you should think of our coronation .
when will his trial be ?
i have come to beg for the life of william wallace .
you fancy him .
nor you . to you that word is as unfamiliar as love .
i will wait . . . back there .
we make spears . a hundred spears . fourteen feet long .
the bruce is not coming , william .
stephen ready ?
thanks for the food and drink . and for bringing em yourselves .
rest , william .
i rest .
you know it is a trap .
probably . but we cannot win alone . we know that . this is the only way .
i do not want to be a martyr .
nor i ! i want to live ! i want a home and children and peace . i have asked god for those things . but he is brought me this sword . and if he wills that i must lay it down to have what he wants for my country , then i will do that too .
that is just a dream , william !
we have lived a dream together . a dream of freedom !
your dreams are not about freedom ! they are about marion ! you have to be a hero , because you think she sees you ! is that it ?
keep these . we are going too .
they are coming !
how many ?
three , maybe more !
armed ?
they are english soldiers , ai not they ?
with your father and brother gone , they will kill us and burn the farm !
wanna stay with me tonight ?
i wanna have supper waiting .
we will get those english pigs tomorrow .
test of manhood .
you win .
call it a test of soldiery , then . the english will not let us train with weapons , so we train with stones .
i still say this is no test . a catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can .
can you do it when it matters ? as it matters in battle ? could you crush a man with that throw ?
you will move
good to see you again .
all right , father , i will ask him ! if i risk my neck for you , will i get a chance to kill englishmen ?
is your poppa a ghost or do you converse with god almighty ?
excellent ! stephen is my name . i am the most wanted man on the emerald isle . except i am not on the emerald isle of course , more s the pity .
a common thief .
we must run in different directions !
we do not split up !
i am the one who is rotting . but i think your face looks graver than mine .
he was so brave . with courage alone he nearly won .
so more men were slaughtered uselessly !
he broke because of me . i saw it . he lost all will to fight .
we must have alliance with england to prevail here . you achieved that ! you saved your family , increased your lands ! in time you will have all the power in scotland ! . . . yet you grieve .
in my heart i had begun to hope that he would never break .
where is my son ?
i sent for him and the little coward send you ? !
shall i leave , m lord ?
my songs loyal wife returns , unkilled by the heathen . so he accepted our bribe .
no . he did not .
then why does he stay ? my scouts say he has not advanced .
he waits . for you . he says he will attack no more towns if you are man enough to come fight him .
you spoke with this wallace in private . what kind of man is he ?
. . . a mindless barbarian . not a king like you , m lord .
the scottish nobles have sent him no support . his army starves . our stall has worked , he must withdraw . you may return to your embroidery .
no . i have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war .
this is what happens when you must send a woman . and a fool .
forgive me , sire . i thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule .
i have faced him . have you ?
let her speak .
treason . against whom ?
against thy king , thou vile fool ! hast thou anything to say ?
never , in my whole life , did i swear allegiance to your king
it matters not , he is thy king !
while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times . i cannot commit treason , if i have never been his subject !
confess , and you may receive a quick death . deny , and you must be purified by pain . do you confess ? . . . do you confess ? !
i do not confess .
your father does not like me , does he ?
it is not you . he dislikes that you are a wallace . he just says . . . the wallaces do not seem to live for very long .
thank you for accepting .
thank you for inviting .
i will invite you again , but your mother thinks i am crazy .
you have been here before ?
some nights . i have dreams . mostly dreams i do not want . i started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when i did sleep i would dream only of the ride and the adventure .
did it work ?
i want . . . to marry you !
i . . . accept your proposal !
i am not just saying it !
nor i !
but i will not give you up to any nobleman .
you scare me .
i do not want to scare you . i want to be yours , and you mine . every night like this one .
this night is too beautiful to have again .
i have missed you .
shush . it is only been a day . and it is seemed like forever .
tonight then .
then when ?
i am dreaming .
yes , you are . and you must wake .
i do not want to wake . i want to stay with you .
and i with you . but you must wake .
i need you so much ! i love you !
when the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes . scotland is in chaos . your husband is secretly sending an army north .
how do you know this ?
last night i slept with a member of the war council .
he should not be telling secrets in bed .
this scottish rebel . . . wallace ? he fights to avenge a woman ?
knowing his passion for his lost love , they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife . he fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place ! now that is romance , oui ?
i am the princess of wales .
i come as the king s servant , and with his authority .
it is battle i want , not talk .
i understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight .
i have been given nothing . god makes men what they are .
did god make you the sacker of peaceful cities ? the executioner of the king s nephew , my husband s own cousin ?
york was the staging point for every invasion of my country . and that royal cousin hanged a hundred scots , even women and children , from the city walls .
let us talk plainly . you invade england . but you cannot complete the conquest , so far from your shelter and supply . the king proposes that you withdraw your attack . in return he grants you title , estates , and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold , which i am to pay to you personally .
a lordship . and gold . that i should become judas .
peace is made is such ways .
i understand you have suffered . i know . . . about your woman .
a meeting in a barn . it had to be a trap . and only you would know i would be aware of it .
why did you ?
you have . . . you have a husband .
you understand . consider , before you laugh and say no . you will never own a throne , though you deserve one . but just as the sun will rise tomorrow , some man will rule england . and what if his veins ran not with the blood of longshanks , but with that of a true king ?
i cannot love you for the sake of revenge .
m lady . . . what kindness of you to visit a stranger .
sir , i . . . come to beg you to confess all , and swear allegiance to the king , that he might show you mercy .
will he show mercy to my country ? will he take back his soldiers , and let us rule ourselves ?
mercy . . . is to die quickly . perhaps even live in the tower . in time , who knows what can happen , if you can only live .
you will die ! it will be awful !
drink this ! it will dull your pain .
it will numb my wits , and i must have them all . if i am senseless , or if i wail , then longshanks will have broken me .
wait ! . . . i respect what you said . but remember , these men have lands , castles . much to risk .
and the common man who bleeds on the battlefield , does he risk less ?
no . but from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself . its nobles share allegiance with england and its clans war with each other . if you make enemies on both sides of the border , you will end up dead .
i am no coward ! i want what you want ! but we need the nobles .
war finds me willing . i know it will not bring back all i have lost . but it can bring what none of us have ever had a country of our own . for that we need a king . we need you .
i am trying .
then tell me what a king is ! is he a man who believes only what others believe ? is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart ? there is strength in you . i see it . i know it .
i must . . . consult with my father .
we cannot stop !
they have tricked us .
that is the crazy man saying , lord ?
the dogs have a scent . my scent . someone must have given it to them .
who would do such a thing ?
i thought i was dead when ya pulled that dagger !
fine speech . now what do we do ?
come , it will help you sleep .
mrs . treborn ! i need to speak with you !
i was going to show this to the principal , but i wanted to talk to you first .
what is it ?
thank you for showing it to me first . i will . . . i will take care of it . can i have the picture ?
of course . there is one more thing , mrs . treborn . and i feel bad for mentioning it . . .
what ?
and you say he does not remember any of it ?
not according to his teacher . it just got me thinking about jason and what if evangs inherited his father s condition ?
just tell me that evan does not have jasongs illness . . .
look , andrea , i am sure he will test negative for brain disorders . but there s something else you can try to monitor his memory .
anything .
a journal . just have him write down everything he does .
why ? what for ?
well , the good news is that the results are negative . i have found no evidence in the way of lesions , hemorrhaging , tumors . . .
and the bad news ?
unfortunately , we have got nothing to work with . it is harder playing detective now .
but you must have something to go on ?
if i had to guess , i would say the blackouts are stress related .
but he is seven . what kind of stress can he have ?
plenty . who knows ? maybe he is got severe coping problems about not having a father . did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend s dad .
come on , i doubt the answer s that simple .
you would be surprised how often they are .
well , he has been pushing me to meet his father , but i have been putting it off .
it is worth a shot . i can arrange a controlled meeting . a careful dose of sedatives for jason , some security , you and i monitoring . evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck , no more missing father complex .
evan wake up , oh please wake up !
actually , these tests were not available twenty years ago .
no dances , just tell me .
we are gonna be late again .
when did you ever care about getting to school on time ?
righty tighty , lefty lucy .
darn it !
um . . . can dad come this time ?
you know the answer to that .
cannot he come out for one day ?
we have been over this a hundred times . it is too dangerous for him .
all the dads are gonna be there .
i get the point , kiddo . but i am not so bad , am i ?
no .
i do not like this place , mom . it is creepy . please can we go ? i promise i will not make any more bad pictures !
that is why i wanted you to come here , evan . dr . redfield already has a background in memory loss .
these will bring you luck , crockett .
what happened ?
honey . what were you doing with that ?
now your father may seem sleepy to you , but that is just because of his medicine , okay ?
i do not know . . . i do not remember .
something must have happened ! what set him off ?
i . . . i blacked out .
please , mom . people will talk .
i cannot help it . i am just so proud of you . you have got the highest grades in all of your classes .
did da jason get good grades ?
please . he got straight a s without ever touching a book . that was the one area where his memory never failed him .
why do you ask ?
no , it is just weird with him being such a brain and all , i just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he would forgotten .
i could not tell if they were real memories or just phantoms . you know , he might only have thought he actually remembered them . . .
sure . . .
and then , just before it got so bad that he had to be committed , he said that he could . . .
. . . i spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal . he is sure he can get you off on self defense , so if you are patient .
how long will i be in here ?
i do not know . these things take time .
i found these . the others are still in storage .
damn it , mom . i told you i need them all !
okay , doc . that is the damage ? how much time have i got ?
what does that mean for evan ?
there must be a way to fix this .
fix ?
you are . acting . like your father .
how . did you . know that ?
just . like . jason .
best not bitch up . wind up someone s luggage that way .
can you protect me ?
you are religious carlos , you believe that bit about the lord works in mysterious ways ?
straight up .
because i think he sent me to your cell on purpose . for you to help me .
shit . i knew you were crazy .
so when i am out , i need you to watch my face and hands closely .
just tell me if anything weird happens .
weirder than this ?
what did you see ? what did it look like ?
signs of the lord . they just appeared out of nowhere . i thought you were loco !
hello , evan . it is very nice to meet you . he is as handsome as his father .
dad lives here ?
now i want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with lenny . think of it like a movie . you can pause , rewind , or slow down any details you wish . understand ?
yes .
where are you now ?
i am standing next to kayleigh , my hands are over her ears .
are you hurting her ?
okay . then go a little forward in time . what do you see now ?
go on . nothing can hurt you . remember , this is only a movie . you are completely safe .
i cannot . . . the car vanishes and all of a sudden i am on the ground in the woods .
the car does not vanish evan . the movie in your head has broken , that is all . but now i have re spliced it and i want you to tell me about the car .
it is a little complicated . i have not seen results exactly like these before .
this is where we are finding most of the hemorrhaging . the outer lining of the cerebral cortex .
hey , evan . that is the big rush ? we do not meet for another hour .
where are my goddamn books ?
books ?
think evan . you have invented a disease that does not exist . alternate universes with colleges , prisons , paraplegia . . .
but i . . . i need those books .
you remind me of your father . he always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one .
get dressed , thumper , you are taking me out for my birthday .
i thought you were a december baby .
it is an experiment with flatworms and a maze . you take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he is memorized it . then you put a new flatworm in the maze . he is clueless . banging into walls , getting lost , whatever .
just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure , it gets all of the worm s memories .
you really think he wanted to kill you ?
i never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so i wanted to wear my clothes but mr . miller took his shirt off
what the fuck are you doing ?
are you stupid or what ?
what ?
whasamatter ? lost your rolex ?
huh ?
get out . both of you .
we should go soon . if dad catches us smoking down here , we are dead .
oh god . . . what did we do ?
i am sorry kayleigh . this was a bad idea .
ouch .
it is not your fault . mrs . kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to lenny .
i deserve a lot worse .
i cannot believe tommy s still pissed at me . he knows i am moving away , right ?
he is been acting real strange lately . he will not even look me in the eyes anymore .
did your mom say if lenny was . . . okay ?
welcome home . thought you might like some fresh air for a change .
god , evan ! i never thought i would see you again . how have you been ?
oh , comme si , comme ca , you know . . .
no , evan . i do not know . it is been a long time . fill me in .
not since we were kids .
i have stopped a hundred times .
so how is tommy ?
no . i emancipated myself when i was fifteen .
wow . that must have taken some courage .
not if you remember my dad .
could not you have moved in with your mom ?
actually , kayleigh , the reason i came back to town was to talk to you .
me ? are you kidding ? why ?
remember when i was a kid i had all these blackouts ?
of course .
well , lately some of the memories have begun to come back and i would kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular . it would be a big help .
well , sure . i will try to remember . shoot .
when we were kids . your dad was making a movie . robin hood or something ?
what do you want to know , evan ?
it is just . . . did he . . . what happened in the basement ?
it was a long time ago .
i know , but . . .
is that why you came all the way back ? to ask a lot of stupid questions about robin hood ?
just shut up , evan . you are wasting your breath .
you cannot hate yourself just because your dad s a twisted freak .
jesus , kayleigh , you are . . . incredible .
where . . . where are my clothes ?
hey , uh , do not go freaking out on me over this , but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera ?
well i remember he had one . . . but he , like , put it away after the first day . why would that freak me out ?
oh my god , that was good . where would you learn all those new tricks ?
so it did not feel . . . weird ?
what do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect ? like , looking back , whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after i moved away ?
i do not understand , where are you taking me ?
i do not know what to say . it is beautiful .
why are you doing all this for me ?
it is my fault . i should have told you he was released a few weeks ago .
might a been nice . like this is gonna do any good . maybe one of the frat guys has a gun .
please , evan . do not even joke . he would not hurt you . he is just trying to scare you away from me .
yeah , right . tell that to crockett .
it is not his fault , evan . you knew how bad he had it when we were kids .
do not give me this oprah book club bad upbringing shit , because you turned out fine .
are you okay ?
what do you mean ?
it is just . . . you have been acting kinda strange , you know ?
like how ?
i do not know . you seem . . . different . you make weird jokes . your accents changed . you do not even walk the same .
i walk differently ?
i cannot put my finger on it , but everything s a bit off . even the dinner tonight . it was beautiful , but . . .
wait . something s not right . is not that your jacket ?
evan , stop ! you are gonna kill him !
i want you to take this , lenny . today s your day of atonement . i know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby
evan . stop it . it is not the time .
oh , i thought you were my eight o clock . make it fast , i am expecting someone .
so how is tricks ? sorry , occupational humor .
i get it . you can drop it now .
oh , i am sorry . does my line of work make you uncomfortable , precious ?
no . just that you need to hurt me with it . i have been where you have been .
ha ! where is that ?
that is happened to you ?
you would not believe me . i mean , people always say , you would not believe me , but in this case , it is not even worth trying .
i have seen some sickening shit . i do not blink twice anymore , especially in your case .
why s that ?
because you are . . . different .
different ? how ?
let me ask you a question . just a little one that is been gnawing at me for years .
yeah ?
on the bridge . how did you know that tommy had your dog ? that was no fucking hunch .
you are right , evan , i do not believe you .
i never thought you would . that is why i have never bothered to tell a soul until now , and why i never will again .
i am the only person you have told ? that is a great line . does that make other girls swoon ? do they actually eat up this bullshit ?
i could not give a shit if you believe me or not , and frankly i am too tired to prove it to you .
oh ? there s proof now ?
shit . i dunno . how would i know about the twin moles on your inner thigh ?
anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that .
i just thought you should know .
know what ?
there s one major hole in your story .
which is ?
sure you do not want your wallet ?
do not think i will need it where i am going .
off to change everyone s life again , is that it ? maybe this time you will pop up in some mansion while i wind up in tijuana doing the donkey act .
i am over it . whenever i try to help anyone it all turns to shit .
where are we going ?
we have to get you to sunnyvale . you are having one of your famous hemorrhages .
you know how spiritual he is gotten ever since he saved mrs . halpern and katie .
is something the matter ?
kayleigh ? do you ever think about us ? i mean , wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us ?
sure , evan , why not ? you were the first person i really ever cared about .
i was ?
that is why when i was little i never went to live with my mother .
i do not get it .
when my folks split , they gave me and tommy a choice who we wanted to live with . i could not stand my dad , but i knew if i moved to my mom s i would never see you again .
i never knew that . so then you still sometimes think of us . . . together ?
it is crossed my mind from time to time .
and . . . ?
well a lot of things cross my mind . i have always been a fast thinker , ev . i can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second . boom we fall in love get married two kids , your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature kids grow old as do we , relatively stable relationships , matching burial plots , the whole bit . it took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine .
then you think it might have worked out ?
we are really gonna be in a movie ! ?
where am i ? what happened ? where did we all go ?
i was just somewhere else how did i get here ?
quit acting like some retard or i will call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you have been .
what time is it ?
it is time for you to stand where the hell i told you .
that is happened to how are you doing that ?
it will change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father . ultimately , it will lead to her suicide . nice work , daddy .
let s just say you are being closely watched , george . your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat kayleigh like . . . oh , let s say like how a loving father treats his daughter . sound okay to you , papa ?
. . . yes .
easy does it , evan ! do not be a bad boy or i will tell mommy you were naughty .
that is dangerous ! you could blow your hands off !
it is okay . i will not bite . you have seen pictures of me , right ?
are you okay ? you looked like you were somewhere else for a second there .
i was praying this curse would have ended with me .
but it did not . and now i need info to make things right again and you are the only one who can give it to me .
there is no right . when you change who people are , you destroy who they were .
you cannot play god , son . it must end with me . just by being here , you may be killing your mother .
evan , you are hysterical . you study for this ?
we will find out soon enough .
you are kidding . are these the answers ? !
damn , evan , on the d . l .
thanks . wow . hey , i want to do something really special for kayleigh tomorrow . if i said i needed some help from you and the brothers . . .
i am not sure . i might have gotten some stories mixed up . did pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts ?
typical psych major . a complete wise ass . and how is your project coming ? still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation ?
whoa ! did not mean to scare you , evan . just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming .
oh , fine i guess . it is been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up , so i have not . . .
just do not drop the ball , okay ?
remember , everyone ! only two weeks until your science projects are due .
i still owe you an essay from last week . is there any way i could get an extension ?
and you are . . . ?
evan treborn .
so that is the point ?
smells like sex in here .
thumper had a busy afternoon .
most guys tuck their porn under here , but all you have are . . . comp books .
yeah . i have been keeping journals since i was seven .
freeze ! no worm boy . no mr . worm , and no worm master general ! once you get a nickname like that you cannot shake it . and i do not want everyone thinking i have got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something , okay ?
come on , go on . . .
it did not feel like a dream .
can . . . can . . . can i have this ?
that should buy you ten minutes at least .
i could not cut the rope .
yeah , good , what else do you remember ?
you knew the whole time , did not you ? when you put the blade in my hand , you knew something big was going to happen . did not you ? !
uh , we should be getting to class now .
are you sure you even packed it ?
what do you need it for ? i do not get you lately .
duly noted . now i am gonna ask you for one last favor .
what ?
shhh . i need to concentrate on the blockbuster if i am gonna destroy it .
destroy it ?
hey , what would you do that for ?
tommy , i am bored shitless over here . that is up already ?
hurry ! let s go ! get him up , evan ! come on !
look what you made me do !
leave us alone you sick fuck !
what the hell are you doing ?
it was not enough that the whole world loves you , but you had to take away the last person on earth who did not think i was a piece of shit .
no one thinks you are a piece of shit , tommy .
listen to me good , evan . . .
i did what you said , man ! we are pooling our student funds with hillel house and we are going to have an awareness dance .
lung cancer ?
mom . do not cry . i can change this .
just get out , didja ?
huh ?
nothing . just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that .
i come from a big family .
meant no offense .
none taken . hey , uh , does kayleigh miller still work here ?
evan , guess what ? dad got a new video camera and we are all gonna be in a movie .
i do not think evan gets to be in it
quit it , tommy . evan gets to be robin hood . i am gonna be maid marian , and you are the sheriff of nottingham !
i thought i was the bad guy !
what did i say about mentioning that bitch ?
where the hell are you taking us anyway ? just blow something up already .
wipe that sad assed look off your face before you get us all busted . you see the way evangs mom was looking at you ?
lenny ? come on !
shut up , tommy !
you put the mommy too far away . mrs . boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it .
here you go , buddy .
what ? no frigging way , man . i am not touching that thing .
the hell you are not . anyone of us does it , you will puss out and narc for sure .
maybe it went out . should someone check it ?
monsieur rick ?
yes ?
how did you get in here ? you are under age .
i came with captain renault .
i should have known .
my husband is with me , too .
no , of course not . do you mind if i do ?
monsieur rick , what kind of man is captain renault ?
oh , he is just like any other man , only more so .
no , i mean , is he trustworthy ? is his word
now , just a minute . who told you to ask me that ?
he did . captain renault did .
i thought so . where is your husband ?
how long have you been married ?
eight weeks . we come from bulgaria . oh , things are very bad there , monsieur . a devil has the people by the throat . so , jan and i , we , we do not want our children to grow up in such a country .
so you decided to go to america .
yes , but we have not much money , and traveling is so expensive and difficult . it was much more than we thought to get here . and then captain renault sees us and he is so kind . he wants to help us .
yes , i will bet .
he tells me he can give us an exit visa , but we have no money .
does he know that ?
oh , yes .
and he is still willing to give you a visa ?
yes , monsieur .
and you want to know
will he keep his word ?
nobody ever loved me that much .
and he never knew , and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart ? that would be all right , would not it ?
you want my advice ?
oh , yes , please .
go back to bulgaria .
oh , but if you knew what it means to us to leave europe , to get to america ! oh , but if jan should find out ! he is such a boy . in many ways i am so much older than he is .
monsieur rick , i
excuse me , but you look like a couple who are on their way to america .
you will find a market there for this ring . i am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice .
thank you , but i hardly think
good .
what is your name ?
such a bargain . but that is your decision ?
mr . berger , the ring , could i see it again ?
yes , monsieur .
i recognize you from the news photographs , monsieur laszlo .
in a concentration camp , one is apt to lose a little weight .
we read five times that you were killed in five different places .
i see .
monsieur rick , may i get you a cup of coffee ?
no thanks , carl .
well , you are in pretty good shape , herr rick .
how long can i afford to stay closed ?
oh , two weeks , maybe three .
maybe i will not have to . a bribe has worked before . in the meantime , everybody stays on salary .
now you finish locking up , will you , carl ?
i will . then i am going to the meeting of the
do not tell me where you are going .
i will not .
goodnight .
the police break up our meeting . herr rick ! we escaped in the last moment .
yes , i come .
i want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance . it might attract the police .
but sacha always puts out that light
tonight he forgot .
i want you to take miss lund home .
excuse me , monsieur rick , but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs . the cashier would like some money .
well , i will get it from the safe .
i am so upset , monsieur rick . you know i cannot understand
forget it , emil . mistakes like that happen all the time .
here you are .
it shall not happen again , monsieur .
here s to you , sir .
er , good luck , yes .
i would better be going .
er , my check , please .
er , goodbye , sir .
hello , rick .
hello , ferrari . how is business at the blue parrot ?
fine , but i would like to buy your cafe .
it is not for sale .
you have not heard my offer .
it is not for sale at any price .
what do you want for sam ?
i do not buy or sell human beings .
that is too bad . that is casablanca s leading commodity . in refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market .
suppose you run your business and let me run mine .
suppose we ask sam . maybe he would like to make a change .
suppose we do .
i see the bus is in . i will take my shipment with me .
no hurry . i will have it sent over . have a drink with me .
i never drink in the morning . and every time you send my shipment over , it is always just a little bit short .
the bourbon . the news about ugarte upset me very much .
of course not . what upsets me is the fact that ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are .
practically no one .
if i could lay my hands on those letters , i could make a fortune .
so could i . and i am a poor businessman .
i have a proposition for whoever has those letters . i will handle the entire transaction , get rid of the letters , take all the risk , for a small percentage .
and the carrying charges ?
naturally there will be a few incidental expenses . that is the proposition i have for whoever has those letters .
i will tell him when he comes in .
rick , i will put my cards on the table . i think you know where those letters are .
that is why i came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place .
shall we draw up the papers , or is our handshake good enough ?
ah , to get out of casablanca and go to america ! you are a lucky man .
oh , by the way , my agreement with sam s always been that he gets twenty five percent of the profits . that still goes .
hmmm . i happen to know that he gets ten percent . but he is worth twenty five .
and abdul and carl and sacha , they stay with the place , or i do not sell .
of course they stay . rick s would not be rick s without them .
do not forget , you owe rick s a hundred cartons of american cigarettes .
you see , my dear , the word has gone around .
as leader of all illegal activities in casablanca , i am an influential and respected man . it would not be worth my life to do anything for monsieur laszlo . you , however , are a different matter .
i will stay here and keep on trying . i am sure in a little while
we have decided , signor ferrari . for the present we will go on looking for two exit visas . thank you very much .
i observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man , monsieur . i am moved to make one more suggestion , why , i do not know , because it cannot possibly profit me , but , have you heard about signor ugarte and the letters of transit ?
yes , something .
do you know where they are ?
rick ?
he is a difficult customer , that rick . one never knows what he will do or why . but it is worth a chance .
it was gracious of you to share it with me . good day , mademoiselle , monsieur .
and mademoiselle ?
mademoiselle , after this disturbance it is not safe for laszlo to stay in casablanca .
this morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave casablanca .
that is also true , except for one destination , to return to occupied france .
occupied france ?
uh huh . under a safe conduct from me .
what value is that ? you may recall what german guarantees have been worth in the past .
there are only two other alternatives for him .
what are they ?
it is possible the french authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here .
and the other alternative ?
it was la belle aurore .
how nice . you remembered . but of course , that was the day the germans marched into paris .
not an easy day to forget .
no .
i remember every detail . the germans wore gray , you wore blue .
say goodnight to sam for me .
i will .
there s still nobody in the world who can play as time goes by like sam .
who are you really ? and what were you before ? what did you do and what did you think ? huh ?
we said no questions .
a franc for your thoughts .
in america they would bring only a penny . i guess that is about all they are worth .
i am willing to be overcharged . tell me .
and i was wondering .
yes ?
why i am so lucky . why i should find you waiting for me to come along .
why there is no other man in my life ?
uh huh .
that is easy . there was . he is dead .
i am sorry for asking . i forgot we said no questions .
richard , they will find out your record . it will not be safe for you here .
my germangs a little rusty .
with the whole world crumbling , we pick this time to fall in love .
yeah . it is pretty bad timing . where were you , say , ten years ago ?
ten years ago ? let s see . . . . . . yes . i was having a brace put on my teeth . where were you ?
was that cannon fire , or is it my heart pounding ?
strange . i know so very little about you .
but be serious , darling . you are in danger and you must leave paris .
no , no , no , no . we must leave .
yes , of course , we
the train for marseilles leaves at five o clock . i will pick you up at your hotel at four thirty .
no , no . not at my hotel . i , uh , i have things to do in the city before i leave . i will meet you at the station , huh ?
that is too far ahead to plan .
yes , i guess it is a little too far ahead . well , let s see . what about the engineer ? why cannot he marry us on the train ?
well , why not ? the captain on a ship can . it does not seem fair that . . . hey , hey , that is wrong , kid ?
oh . i saved my first drink to have with you . here .
no . no , rick . not tonight .
please .
why did you have to come to casablanca ? there are other places .
i would not have come if i had known that you were here . believe me , rick , it is true . i did not know .
it is funny about your voice , how it has not changed . i can still hear it . richard dear , i will go with you any place . we will get on a train together and never stop .
please do not . do not , rick . i can understand how you feel .
huh ! you understand how i feel . how long was it we had , honey ?
i did not count the days .
can i tell you a story , rick ?
has it got a wow finish ?
i do not know the finish yet .
well , go on , tell it . maybe one will come to you as you go along .
it is about a girl who had just come to paris from her home in oslo . at the house of some friends she met a man about whom she would heard her whole life , a very great and courageous man . he opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals . everything she knew or ever became was because of him . and she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love .
i am sorry i was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night .
why did you come back ? to tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station ?
yes .
well , you can tell me now . i am reasonably sober .
i do not think i will , rick .
why not ? after all , i got stuck with a railway ticket . i think i am entitled to know .
last night i saw what has happened to you . the rick i knew in paris , i could tell him . he would understand . but the one who looked at me with such hatred . . . well , i will be leaving casablanca soon and we will never see each other again . we knew very little about each other when we were in love in paris . if we leave it that way , maybe we will remember those days and not casablanca , not last night .
did you run out on me because you could not take it ? because you knew what it would be like , hiding from the police , running away all the time ?
you can believe that if you want to .
all the same , someday you will lie to laszlo . you will be there .
how did you get in ?
i told you this morning you would come around , but this is a little ahead of schedule . well , will not you sit down ?
richard , i had to see you .
you use richard again ? we are back in paris .
please .
your unexpected visit is not connected by any chance with the letters of transit ? it seems that as long as i have those letters i will never be lonely .
you can ask any price you want , but you must give me those letters .
i went through all that with your husband . it is no deal .
i know how you feel about me , but i am asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important .
do i have to hear again what a great man your husband is ? what an important cause he is fighting for ?
it was your cause , too . in your own way , you were fighting for the same thing .
richard , richard , we loved each other once . if those days meant anything at all to you
i would not bring up paris if i were you . it is poor salesmanship .
please . please listen to me . if you knew what really happened , if you only knew the truth
no . oh , richard , i am sorry . i am sorry , but , but you , you are our last hope . if you do not help us , victor laszlo will die in casablanca .
all right . i tried to reason with you . i tried everything . now i want those letters . get them for me .
i do not have to . i have got them right here .
put them on the table .
no .
for the last time , put them on the table .
and then ?
it was not long after we were married that victor went back to czechoslovakia . they needed him in prague , but there the gestapo were waiting for him . just a two line item in the paper victor laszlo apprehended . sent to concentration camp . i was frantic . for months i tried to get word . then it came . he was dead , shot trying to escape . i was lonely . i had nothing . not even hope . then i met you .
oh , it was not my secret , richard . victor wanted it that way . not even our closest friends knew about our marriage . that was his way of protecting me . i knew so much about his work , and if the gestapo found out i was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me .
when did you first find out he was alive ?
just before you and i were to leave paris together . a friend came and told me that victor was alive . they were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of paris . he was sick , he needed me . i wanted to tell you , but i , i did not care . i knew , i knew you would not have left paris , and the gestapo would have caught you . so i . . . well , well , you know the rest .
huh . but it is still a story without an ending . what about now ?
now ? i do not know . i know that i will never have the strength to leave you again .
and laszlo ?
oh , you will help him now , richard , will not you ? you will see that he gets out ? then he will have his work , all that he is been living for .
i cannot fight it anymore . i ran away from you once . i cannot do it again . oh , i do not know that is right any longer . you will have to think for both of us , for all of us .
all right , i will . here s looking at you , kid .
richard , victor thinks i am leaving with him . have not you told him ?
no , not yet .
but it is all right , is not it ? you were able to arrange everything ?
everything is quite all right .
but why my name , richard ?
because you are getting on that plane .
i do not understand . what about you ?
no , richard , no . what has happened to you ? last night we said
last night we said a great many things . you said i was to do the thinking for both of us . well , i have done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing . you are getting on that plane with victor where you belong .
but richard , no , i , i
i am saying it because it is true . inside of us we both know you belong with victor . you are part of his work , the thing that keeps him going . if that plane leaves the ground and you are not with him , you will regret it .
no .
maybe not today , maybe not tomorrow , but soon , and for the rest of your life .
but what about us ?
we will always have paris . we did not have , we would lost it , until you came to casablanca . we got it back last night .
and i said i would never leave you .
yes .
hello , sam .
it is been a long time .
yes , ma am . a lot of water under the bridge .
some of the old songs , sam .
where is rick ?
when will he be back ?
not tonight no more . he ai not coming . uh , he went home .
does he always leave so early ?
oh , he never . . . well . . . he is got a girl up at the blue parrot . he goes up there all the time .
you used to be a much better liar , sam .
leave him alone , miss ilsa . you are bad luck to him .
play it once , sam , for old time s sake .
i do not know what you mean , miss ilsa .
play it , sam . play as time goes by .
victor , i , i feel somehow we should not stay here .
you are very kind .
this time they really mean to stop me .
victor , i am afraid for you .
i must find out what berger knows .
be careful .
goodnight .
goodnight .
we are only interested in two visas , signor .
please , ilsa , do not be hasty .
no , ilsa , i will not let you stay here . you must get to america . and believe me , somehow i will get out and join you .
but , victor , if the situation were different , if i had to stay and there were only a visa for one , would you take it ?
yes , i see . when i had trouble getting out of lille , why did not you leave me there ? and when i was sick in marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time , why did not you leave me then ?
he does . could we have a table close to him ?
what happened with rick ?
our faithful friend is still there .
victor , please , do not go to the underground meeting tonight .
do not joke . after major strasser s warning tonight , i am frightened .
whatever i would say , you would carry on . victor , why do not you tell me about rick ? what did you find out ?
apparently he has the letters .
yes ?
did he give any reason ?
he suggested i ask you .
ask me ?
ilsa , i
yes ?
yes , victor , i was .
i know how it is to be lonely . is there anything you wish to tell me ?
no , victor , there is not .
yes , yes i know . victor , whatever i do , will you believe that i , that
be careful .
are you ready ilsa ?
captain , the boy who is playing the piano , somewhere i have seen him .
sam ?
yes .
he came from paris with rick .
rick ? who s he ?
mademoiselle , you are in rick s and rick is
is what ?
hello , rick .
well then , perhaps you also
i cannot get over you two . she was asking about you earlier , rick , in a way that made me extremely jealous .
i am afraid major strasser would insist .
how do you do ?
how do you do ?
one hears a great deal about rick in casablanca .
and about victor laszlo everywhere .
and i congratulate you .
what for ?
your work .
thank you . i try .
i hope we did not overstay our welcome .
we will come again .
good morning .
good evening .
good evening . you see , here we are again .
monsieur blaine , i wonder if i could talk to you ?
go ahead .
well , is not there some other place ? it is rather confidential , what i have to say .
my office .
you must know it is very important i get out of casablanca . it is my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement . you know what i have been doing . you know what it means to the work , to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that i be free to reach america and continue my work .
i am not interested in politics . the problems of the world are not in my department . i am a saloon keeper .
my friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record . you ran guns to ethiopia . you fought against the fascists in spain .
what of it ?
is not it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog ?
are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs ?
i appreciate it , but i do not accept it .
i will raise it to two hundred thousand .
my friend , you could make it a million francs , or three , my answer would still be the same .
there must be some reason why you will not let me have them .
there is . i suggest that you ask your wife .
i beg your pardon ?
i said , ask your wife .
well , this might come in handy .
thank you .
had a close one , eh ?
do not you sometimes wonder if it is worth all this ? i mean what you are fighting for ?
we might as well question why we breathe . if we stop breathing , we will die . if we stop fighting our enemies , the world will die .
you know how you sound , monsieur blaine ? like a man who s trying to convince himself of something he does not believe in his heart . each of us has a destiny , for good or for evil .
i wonder if you do . i wonder if you know that you are trying to escape from yourself and that you will never succeed .
you seem to know all about my destiny .
i know a good deal more about you than you suspect . i know , for instance , that you are in love with a woman . it is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman . the first evening i came here in this cafe , i knew there was something between you and ilsa . since no one is to blame , i , i demand no explanation . i ask only one thing . you will not give me the letters of transit . all right . but i want my wife to be safe . i ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from casablanca .
you love her that much ?
monsieur blaine , i do not know how to thank you .
i brought the money , monsieur blaine .
keep it . you will need it in america .
but we made a deal .
oh , never mind about that . you will not have any trouble in lisbon , will you ?
no . it is all arranged .
everything in order ?
all except one thing . there s something you should know before you leave .
monsieur blaine , i do not ask you to explain anything .
i am going to anyway , because it may make a difference to you later on . you said you knew about ilsa and me .
yes .
i understand .
monsieur laszlo , is it not ?
yes .
i am captain renault , prefect of police .
yes . what is it you want ?
merely to welcome you to casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay . it is not often we have so distinguished a visitor .
thank you . i hope you will forgive me , captain , but the present french administration has not always been so cordial . may i present miss ilsa lund ?
no , captain , please .
let us say that it is my request . that is a much more pleasant word .
my bill .
well ! a precedent is being broken . er , emil !
ricky , you are becoming quite human . i suppose we have to thank you for that , mademoiselle .
ilsa , i do not wish to be the one to say it , but it is late .
tomorrow at ten at the prefect s office .
we will be there .
i am delighted to see you both . did you have a good night s rest ?
i slept very well .
that is strange . nobody is supposed to sleep well in casablanca .
may we proceed with the business ?
with pleasure . will not you sit down ?
i am afraid not . my regrets , monsieur .
and the honor of having served the third reich .
monsieur , insofar as it is in my power
thank you .
by the way , monsieur , last night you evinced an interest in signor ugarte .
yes .
i believe you have a message for him ?
i am making out the report now . we have not quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape .
i am sure you will excuse me if i am not gracious , but you see , major strasser , i am a czechoslovakian .
i have never accepted that privilege , and i am now on french soil .
i should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on french soil .
this is hardly the time or the place .
then we shall state another time and another place . tomorrow at ten in the prefect s office , with mademoiselle .
very well , herr laszlo , we will not mince words . you are an escaped prisoner of the reich . so far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us . you have reached casablanca . it is my duty to see that you stay in casablanca .
whether or not you succeed is , of course , problematical .
is that all you wish to tell us ?
do not be in such a hurry . you have all the time in the world . you may be in casablanca indefinitely . . . or you may leave for lisbon tomorrow , on one condition .
and that is ?
you know the leaders of the underground movement in paris , in prague , in brussels , in amsterdam , in oslo , in belgrade , in athens .
even in berlin .
you will give us the names ?
and what if you track down these men and kill them ? what if you murdered all of us ? from every corner of europe , hundreds , thousands , would rise to take our places . even nazis cannot kill that fast .
herr laszlo , you have a reputation for eloquence which i can now understand . but in one respect you are mistaken . you said the enemies of the reich could all be replaced , but there is one exception . no one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape .
for the time being .
unoccupied france welcomes you to casablanca .
thank you , captain . it is very good to be here .
you may find the climate of casablanca a trifle warm , major .
oh , we germans must get used to all climates , from russia to the sahara . but perhaps you were not referring to the weather .
what else , my dear major ?
by the way , the murder of the couriers , what has been done ?
oh , there is no hurry . tonight he will be at rick s . everybody comes to rick s .
good evening , gentlemen .
thank you . it is a pleasure to have you here , major .
champagne and a tin of caviar .
may i recommend veuve cliquot , a good french wine .
especially so tonight , major . in a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers .
rick , this is major heinrich strasser of the third reich .
you repeat third reich as though you expected there to be others .
well , personally , major , i will take what comes .
ho , diplomatist !
rick is completely neutral about everything . and that takes in the field of women , too .
of course , one must admit he has great courage .
you see , major , you have nothing to worry about rick .
mademoiselle .
i strongly suspect that ugarte left the letters of transit with mr . blaine . i would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly .
if rick has the letters , he is much too smart to let you find them there .
you give him credit for too much cleverness . my impression was that he is just another blundering american .
as to laszlo , we want him watched twenty four hours a day .
you see , captain , the situation is not as much under control as you believe .
captain renault , are you entirely certain which side you are on ?
i have no conviction , if that is what you mean . i blow with the wind , and the prevailing wind happens to be from vichy .
we are concerned about more than casablanca . we know that every french province in africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance , waiting , perhaps , for a leader .
a leader , like laszlo ?
uh , huh . i have been thinking . it is too dangerous if we let him go . it may be too dangerous if we let him stay .
you see what i mean ? if laszlo s presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration , what more will his presence in casablanca bring on ? i advise that this place be shut up at once .
but everybody s having such a good time .
yes , much too good a time . the place is to be closed .
but i have no excuse to close it .
what is the meaning of that phone call ?
why do you stand here ? why do not you stop him ?
hello , louis .
you know , i think now i shall pay a call on yvonne , maybe get her on the rebound , eh ?
the plane to lisbon . you would like to be on it ?
why ? that is in lisbon ?
it was a combination of all three .
and what in heavengs name brought you to casablanca ?
my health . i came to casablanca for the waters .
waters ? what waters ? we are in the desert .
i was misinformed .
rick , there s going to be some excitement here tonight . we are going to make an arrest in your cafe .
what , again ?
if you are thinking of warning him , do not put yourself out . he cannot possibly escape .
i stick my neck out for nobody .
you know , rick , we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the blue parrot , but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here . it will amuse your customers .
i see . and that is strasser doing here ? he certainly did not come all the way to casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency .
how observant you are . as a matter of fact , i wanted to give you a word of advice .
yeah ? have a brandy ?
thank you . rick , there are many exit visas sold in this cafe , but we know that you have never sold one . that is the reason we permit you to remain open .
i thought it was because we let you win at roulette .
that is another reason . there is a man who s arrived in casablanca on his way to america . he will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa .
yeah ? that is his name ?
victor laszlo .
rick , that is the first time i have ever seen you so impressed .
well , he is succeeded in impressing half the world .
it is my duty to see that he does not impress the other half . rick , laszlo must never reach america . he stays in casablanca .
it will be interesting to see how he manages .
manages what ?
his escape .
oh , but i just told you .
stop it . he escaped from a concentration camp and the nazis have been chasing him all over europe .
this is the end of the chase .
is that a serious offer ?
i just paid out twenty . i would like to get it back .
make it ten . i am only a poor corrupt official .
okay .
done . no matter how clever he is , he still needs an exit visa , or i should say , two .
why two ?
he is traveling with a lady .
he will take one .
i think not . i have seen the lady . and if he did not leave her in marseilles , or in oran , he certainly will not leave her in casablanca .
maybe he is not quite as romantic as you are .
it does not matter . there is no exit visa for him .
louis , whatever gave you the impression that i might be interested in helping laszlo escape ?
oh , laugh if you will , but i happen to be familiar with your record . let me point out just two items . in you ran guns to ethiopia . in , you fought in spain on the loyalist side .
and got well paid for it on both occasions .
the winning side would have paid you much better .
maybe . well , it seems you are determined to keep laszlo here .
i have my orders .
yeah , you were saying ?
oh , how do you do ?
that makes rick a citizen of the world .
well , you were asking about rick and here he is . mademoiselle , may i present
oh , no , rick never
oh , it is my party .
well , ricky . i am very pleased with you . now you are beginning to live like a frenchman .
well , i told strasser he would not find the letters here . but i told my men to be especially destructive . you know how that impresses germans ? rick , have you got these letters of transit ?
louis , are you pro vichy or free french ?
serves me right for asking a direct question . the subject is closed .
well , it looks like you are a little late .
so yvonne s gone over to the enemy .
as i suspected , you are a rank sentimentalist .
yeah ? why ?
why do you interfere with my little romances ?
put it down as a gesture to love .
how can you close me up ? on what grounds ?
but you have not any actual proof , and you know it . this is not germany or occupied france . all you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days . you might as well let him go now .
ricky , i would advise you not to be too interested in what happens to laszlo . if by any chance you were to help him escape
what makes you think i would stick my neck out for laszlo ?
because one , you have bet ten thousand francs he would escape . two , you have the letters of transit , now do not bother to deny it . and , well , you might do it simply because you do not like strasser s looks . as a matter of fact , i do not like him either .
well , they are all excellent reasons .
do not count too much on my friendship , ricky . in this matter i am powerless . besides , i might lose ten thousand francs .
you are not very subtle , but you are effective . i , i get the point . yes , i have the letters , but i intend using them myself . i am leaving casablanca on tonight s plane , the last plane .
huh ?
and i am taking a friend with me . one you will appreciate .
what friend ?
ilsa lund . that ought to put your mind to rest about my helping laszlo escape . the last man i want to see in america .
ilsa is laszlo s wife . she probably knows things that strasser would like to know . louis , i will make a deal with you . instead of this petty charge you have against him , you can get something really big , something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years . that would be quite a feather in your cap , would not it ?
it certainly would . germany . . . vichy would be very grateful .
i will arrange to have laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit , and that will give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest . you get him , and we get away . to the germans that last will be just a minor annoyance .
there s still something about this business i do not quite understand . miss lund , she is very beautiful , yes , but you were never interested in any woman .
i see . how do i know you will keep your end of the bargain ?
i will make the arrangements right now with laszlo in the visitor s pen .
ricky , i am going to miss you . apparently you are the only one in casablanca who has even less scruples than i .
oh , thanks .
you are late .
i was informed just as laszlo was about to leave the hotel , so i knew i would be on time .
i thought i asked you to tie up your watchdogs .
you know , this place will never be the same without you , ricky .
yes , i know what you mean , but i have already spoken to ferrari . you will still win at roulette .
i have the letters right here .
tell me , when we searched the place , where were they ?
sam s piano .
not so fast , louis . nobody s going to be arrested . not for a while yet .
have you taken leave of your senses ?
i have . sit down over there .
i suppose you know what you are doing , but i wonder if you realize what this means ?
i do . we have got plenty of time to discuss that later .
call off your watch dogs you said .
just the same , you call the airport and let me hear you tell them . and remember , this gungs pointed right at your heart .
if you do not mind , you fill in the names . that will make it even more official .
you think of everything , do not you ?
well i was right . you are a sentimentalist .
what you just did for laszlo , and that fairy tale that you invented to send ilsa away with him . i know a little about women , my friend . she went , but she knew you were lying .
anyway , thanks for helping me out .
i suppose you know this is not going to be pleasant for either of us , especially for you . i will have to arrest you of course .
well , rick , you are not only a sentimentalist , but you have become a patriot .
maybe , but it seemed like a good time to start .
it might be a good idea for you to disappear from casablanca for a while . there s a free french garrison over at brazzaville . i could be induced to arrange a passage .
my letter of transit ? i could use a trip . but it does not make any difference about our bet . you still owe me ten thousand francs .
and that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses .
our expenses ?
uh huh .
where were you last night ?
that is so long ago , i do not remember .
will i see you tonight ?
give me another .
sacha , she is had enough .
rick , i am sick and tired of having you
come on , we are going to get your coat .
make it official , if you like .
what is your nationality ?
i understand you came here from paris at the time of the occupation .
there seems to be no secret about that .
are you one of those people who cannot imagine the germans in their beloved paris ?
well , there are certain sections of new york , major , that i would not advise you to try to invade .
aha . who do you think will win the war ?
are my eyes really brown ?
you will forgive my curiosity , mr . blaine . the point is , an enemy of the reich has come to casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us .
my interest in whether victor laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one .
in this case , you have no sympathy for the fox , huh ?
not particularly . i understand the point of view of the hound , too .
you will excuse me , gentlemen . your business is politics . mine is running a saloon .
i would advise you not to interfere .
hello ?
put that phone down !
get me the radio tower !
uh , excuse me , please . hello , rick .
huh . you know , rick , watching you just now with the deutsches bank , one would think you would been doing this all your life .
well , what makes you think i have not ?
oh , nothing . but when you first came to casablanca , i thought
may i ? too bad about those two german couriers , was not it ?
they got a lucky break . yesterday they were just two german clerks . today they are the honored dead .
thank you . will you have a drink with me please ?
no .
i forgot . you never drink with . . . i will have another , please . you despise me , do not you ?
if i gave you any thought , i probably would .
but why ? oh , you object to the kind of business i do , huh ? but think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if i did not help them . that is not so bad . through ways of my own i provide them with exit visas .
for a price , ugarte , for a price .
but think of all the poor devils who cannot meet renault s price . i get it for them for half . is that so parasitic ?
i do not mind a parasite . i object to a cut rate one .
well , rick , after tonight i will be through with the whole business , and i am leaving finally this casablanca .
who did you bribe for your visa ? renault or yourself ?
one moment . tonight i will be selling those for more money than even i have ever dreamed of , and then , addio casablanca ! you know , rick , i have many friends in casablanca , but somehow , just because you despise me you are the only one i trust . will you keep these for me ? please .
for how long ?
perhaps an hour , perhaps a little longer .
i do not want them here overnight .
rick ! rick , help me !
do not be a fool . you cannot get away .
sam , ferrari wants you to work for him at the blue parrot .
i like it fine here .
he will double what i pay you .
yeah , but i ai not got time to spend the money i make here .
boss !
yeah ?
boss , ai not you going to bed ?
ai not you planning on going to bed in the near future ?
no .
you ever going to bed ?
no .
well , i ai not sleepy either .
good . then have a drink .
no . not me , boss .
then do not have a drink .
boss , let s get out of here .
no , sir . i am waiting for a lady .
please , boss , let s go . ai not nothing but trouble for you here .
she is coming back . i know she is coming back .
we will take the car and drive all night . we will get drunk . we will go fishing and stay away until she is gone .
shut up and go home , will you ?
they grab ugarte and she walks in . well , that is the way it goes . one in , one out . sam ?
yeah , boss ?
sam , if it is december in casablanca , what time is it in new york ?
uh , my watch stopped .
that is that you are playing ?
just a little something of my own .
well , stop it . you know what i want to hear .
no , i do not .
you played it for her and you can play it for me .
well , i do not think i can remember it .
if she can stand it , i can . play it !
this sort of takes the sting out of being occupied , does not it , mr . richard ?
and getting closer every minute . here . drink up . we will never finish the other three .
where is she ? have you seen her ?
it took this test package thirty two hours to get from seattle to st . petersburg , a distance of nine thousand miles . and then it took forty one hours to get from our warehouse in st . petersburg to here , a distance of , what
six kilometers . four miles .
it is bad .
worse than warsaw .
nobody remembers that .
save some for tomorrow .
shit ! shit ! shit !
stay calm , identify the problem . problem , rope fraying . solution , fix rope .
get up .
feels so good to lie here .
cannot . need water .
you have had today s water .
thirsty .
come on , shape up , get going , you can do it .
okay look , i know you are tired , i know you are thirsty , but give it one more shot , you have just got to do a little more .
do too much , i will die .
do too little you will die .
no more water , you said .
take it .
no .
take it , damn it .
no .
if they cannot see you , that is the point ?
polaris , where are you ? maybe i am too far south .
you do not know where you are . you missed the shipping lanes .
you are putting off the inevitable .
get water !
fix raft first .
you are beautiful . marry me .
what are you doing ?
cannot kill another one . cannot . cannot kill my friends anymore .
you fucking bleeding heart , you kill or you die .
why do they have to die for me ?
i am lost . goodbye .
look , just slip off the raft . the ocean would feel so good , the water s so soft and warm . take a little swim . sleep .
you quitter you quitter you quitter .
the sea is lovely , dark and deep .
but i have promises to keep . and miles to go before i sleep . and miles to go before i sleep . got to fix the sea anchor . use the sail .
use the sail for a sea anchor and you will not move .
if i do not have a sea anchor i will capsize .
that is death knocking , knocking on your door . crazy little woman come knocking , knocking at my front door . . .
grow up , stop being such a baby . other people get through a lot worse .
you know , wilson , every now and then we should say thank you . thank you god .
what are you smiling about ? they will be back .
they are never going to see you . you are just another piece of trash in the ocean .
they are on autopilot .
they are always on autopilot . or else it is night , or you are in the sun , or you are in the trough of a wave . they will never see you .
i float . you sink . end of story .
i am serious . i am always going on about me , me , me . enough about me . your turn .
it is a fucking soccer ball , you idiot .
that is so damn funny ?
jesus .
it is real .
nothing out there but ocean .
what did it matter if fedex was five minutes late one day ? the next day we just start over again .
it matters . we do the best we can , that is all we have .
you cannot make it .
you came on a bicycle ? no wonder it is so late .
well , i have to say , i am impressed . you never gave up .
you know what happened to this ?
as much as anybody .
want to come in ? get dry for a minute .
hmmm . feels like it might have gotten wet .
possible . so you did those wings ?
yeah . a long time ago .
they are harder to do than they look .
oh ? you have tried ?
our apologies that it never made it to the recipient .
i cannot believe this . i i they are . . . you are a gifted artist . you are into something very powerful . primal . truly .
well , not really , i
to tell you the truth you did .
do you . . . have any more packages to deliver ?
no . that was the last one .
keep painting . promise me .
did you really steal a crippled kid s bicycle to make your deliveries , or is that just some bullshit story ?
what brings you out to the sticks ?
had a package to deliver .
you ? personally ?
i had it on the island with me .
yeah , a long one .
i have got lots of time .
sonofabitch !
your eyes are puffy . did you take valium again ?
my last chapter s in there , and the damn machine s jammed .
how was russia ?
cold .
do not overwhelm me with details , you know how i hate that . did you get it fixed ?
got to follow the paper path here .
chuck .
what do you want me to say ? that i thought i would done a great job but it all turned to shit ? that i might as well have gone sailing for all the good i did ?
merry christmas eve .
four four . a record .
you do not seem too happy about it .
ah , the staff meeting could have gone better .
hey , look at you .
he is a cute thing .
he is your cute thing .
i cannot even keep fish alive .
a puppy s got a little more personality than a fish .
you know , for when you travel .
i have to go . i am on call for overflow down at the hub .
a ring . i wanted a ring .
look , i love the puppy . i love you . but i have to go .
you cannot go now .
i have to .
this is not working out .
we are a little emotional here . it is christmas , maybe we are over reacting .
we are not over reacting .
could you watch jango ?
no .
that is your dog .
it is our dog . it belongs to us .
there is not any us .
i am sorry about the presents . i got a little carried away .
no , it was great . maybe a little overkill
why did not you come over , get mad at me , tell me what a stupid bitch i was .
i guess i had not thought through how i felt .
what , you were going to come over the next day all calm and say , kelly that really made me mad ? do not tell me you are mad . be mad . be who you are right now .
look , we will do our trip as soon as i get back .
get back ? from where ?
chuck , you are breaking my heart .
a week , max . okay ? okay ?
i am sorry . . . i am sorry . . .
right back , you said you would be right back .
i got married .
i thought you might have .
i would never
i know .
if i would known you were alive
i did not want to . it just happened . one day gary was there . he took care of everything . he took care of me . i was a mess .
her name s hannah .
is that jango ?
that is that ?
all that time i waited to go on a cruise , and you went without me .
that is that , written on the sail ?
there was a coffin ?
yeah , coffin , headstone , the whole thing .
what was inside ?
your calendar , your cell phone , your whoo pig sooey hat , some pictures of that ketch you wanted .
that about sums it up .
maybe now s when you tell me about it .
the plane went down . my friends died . i washed up on an island . then i found these barrels , built the raft , and here i am .
yeah ?
the tide came in , the tide went out . i survived . that is the headline . i survived .
come on . try .
cliches , mainly . do not take anyone for granted . do not sweat the small stuff . live each day like it is your last .
so simple to say , so hard to do .
you hated being alone . could not stand it . busy every minute . always plugged into something .
this is so unfair .
you okay ?
what will you do ?
i have got to get back to memphis . hannah s babysitter has finals .
it means a lot . . . that you came .
i love you , chuck .
you too .
i need the latest pdrs on st . petersburg .
and how was your christmas ?
whengs the next jumbo ?
the regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow .
anything else ?
my favorite doctor . that is the verdict ?
sorry . . . sorry . . . why do my joints still ache ?
dehydration . vitamin deficiency . protein deficiency . any or all of the above .
all i ate was fish . that is solid protein .
protein digestion is very costly in water usage .
which i did not have .
i am one lucky guy .
your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability , depression , anxiety , periods of self reproach . it is almost like schizophrenia . different sides of your personality might come to life , speak out , act out .
if you say you are .
i most definitely say i am .
yes , yes he did .
you are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life ?
doc , i am not on the island . i am not on the raft . i am alive . i am so glad to be back , i cannot tell you . i just want out of here .
need some help ?
you are not out of pascagoula , are you ?
i used to drive one of those . a long time ago .
hey , once a driver , always a driver . you want a lift ? i have just got one more pickup .
you are chuck noland .
bless us o lord , and these thy gifts , which we are about to receive , from thou bounty , through christ the lord . amen .
thought you were going to bring her .
but chickens ?
sixty three pounds consumed per capita , up from twenty seven in . going to pass beef . chickengs global . no religious taboos . you do not see your hindus and your muslims boycotting poultry .
really ?
come on down to the plant . it is state of the art . we are doing for chickens what fedex did for the delivery business .
what happened to your pants ?
it seemed like she had such a good time last time .
look , i help take care of the place . you got my check , did not you mom ?
mom , this is a farm . we have got real strawberries growing outside , we have got real cream .
maybe i should take a few days off . roger s working now , you could use some help around here . . .
do not you even think about it .
the place is falling apart .
doing great , mom , do not worry about me .
when would you start working here ?
roger got me on . i was not doing anything , and but you are back , you are really back . i would have come to memphis , but
i have got all this back pay coming . why do not you let me get you a place in town ?
what a journey you have had . it seems more than a person should have to bear .
trying .
okay . after three years the ptr reverts to tape storage , which is okay because we access it through the cpc . here it is . ten packages from the same sender . baku . delhi . st . petersburg . the guy was a real road warrior . this package was kuala lampur . no activity in his account after this package . no forwarding addresses after k . l .
what about the sender ?
hmmm . durango , colorado asheville , north carolina , then . . . canceled her account .
can you find her ?
kamal is not here .
who is this ? where is kamal ?
it is ibrim , i , i am a sorter .
that is going on down there ?
kamal is not here . we are very defused .
what do you expect , from the guy who stole a kid s bicycle when his truck broke down ?
how would it go ?
you what ?
i checked the weather , you had the jet stream , you could have made it up .
but i might not have .
jesus . i got it working . . . you have no idea how hard it was . . . they are finally a team . . .
i am touched .
you fucked us over .
the point of fedex , as i understand it , is to make the damn connection .
i was making a point .
what ? let paris hold its plane ? let memphis take care of it ? let somebody down the line clean up your mess ?
every person counts , every package counts , that is my point .
you know what your problem is ? you just see the packages in front of you . you do not see the big picture .
i did not know we had sailboats .
it is a ketch kelly and i had chartered .
and never take .
look , i am sorry about your plane . but i could not risk being late into memphis .
forget it .
you know general mclelland , he would not attack unless he had everything just right . finally abe lincoln came to him and said , general , if you are not going to use my army , could i borrow it for a while ? so he gave it to grant and grant just said , let s go .
i am from arkansas . tell me a story with robert e . lee in it and maybe i will pay attention .
we are warriors , not desk jockeys . we have got to be bold . you always want all your ducks lined up . but nothing s percent . it is always , maybe . hell , i would take . then roll the dice .
that is why you are a gambling man .
that is why i am running foreign and you are not . that is why you are not married and i am .
for the third time .
you are one sick fucker .
i am trying to help you here . there s warsaw , there s this
a hundred rubles st . petersburg hits percent in a month .
ninety five percent ? just give me the money now .
talk is cheap . are we on or not ?
malaysia s tanking . we are meeting in ten in operations .
hello ?
god damn ! god damn ! chuck , it is you !
it is me .
you are fucking dead !
i beat the odds !
hello .
how about we go somewhere else ?
this stinks really bad .
cool ropes .
i braided them .
must have taken a hell of a long time .
you were how long on this ?
when i first showed up , i thought you would lost your fucking marbles .
to wilson .
you have been over the line and you came back . you have been saved , hallelujah !
i am serious . the burning bush , the big picture , the words in neon . . .
to life . fuck em if they cannot take a joke .
to life .
that is all there is .
digital laser readers .
take your time .
what ?
that is what it is about .
not just that . take your time . use it . live it .
what , then ?
deliver this package . then , i dunno .
you want that delivered , we will deliver it . that is what we do .
i need to do it .
thanks . for everything .
permission to come aboard , sir .
permission granted .
may i ask , where are you bound ?
san francisco . and you ?
as it happens , i am headed for frisco myself .
would you do us the honor of joining us ? we are just sitting down at mess . pork chops and gravy , cranberries , baked potatoes with all the trimmings , fresh baked bread , apple pie . . .
only if you can afford it .
it is not ergot , it is not pituitary extract , it is not oil of rue . . .
wilbur , the adopting couple is waiting in your office .
i was dreaming about you . how beautiful you were !
you were not dreaming about me .
then i was not beautiful .
you were ! you are ! it was fantastic .
they want to replace me ! the board of trustees wants to replace me !
they just want you to hire some new help .
he will need clothes . . . some money . . .
let him try to make some money ! that is part of seeing the world , is not it ?
oh , just stop it ! you knew this was going to happen . he is a young man .
he is still a boy out in the world , he is still a boy .
he is a goddamn psychiatrist of course he wants to help ! he would be happy if he could help commit me !
it is that mrs . goodhall you have to be careful of , wilbur .
this is your life story , wilbur ! you just changed the dates !
an internship and two years of training at the boston lying in , south end branch . for his age , he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon he is also experienced in pediatric care . . .
you invented him ! you have completely made his up !
these credentials are against the law !
oh my , yes ! this is a far superior taste and crisp , too ! you know , so many apples are disappointingly mealy . i wonder of most of the apples in my life were not meant for pies !
wilbur , he picked them for us himself . . .
i suppose it would not hurt to meet him . that is his name again ?
dr . homer wells .
he sniffs that ether ! i have seen him do it !
it is because he is too tired to sleep . he has to .
he smells like he could put you to sleep !
he is a doctor , buster doctors smell like ether .
you are a doctor , homer you do not smell like ether .
i am not a doctor . i have not been to medical school i have not even been to high school !
but you have studied with the old man for years !
i am not a doctor !
i mean your parents .
i know who you mean . i think about leaving here , but not to find them .
why not ?
whoever they were , they did not do any of the things parents are supposed to do . dr . larch did those things , and nurse edna , and nurse angela .
yeah . but sometimes i wish i could meet mine , anyway .
what for , buster ? what would you do if you met them ?
uh . . . i would like to show them that i can cook , a little .
you cook very well !
and that i can drive a truck !
better than i can !
homer , you know i would never kill anyone you know i would not .
i think mary agnes could kill someone .
that is she so emotional about ?
what would she die of ?
what are you going to tell the little ones ?
i will tell them fuzzy was adopted .
why would the little ones believe that anyone would adopt him ?
they will believe it because they want to believe it .
should not we tell homer ?
it is time somebody ate them .
i was looking for wally s letter . i was gonna show it to homer . . . they made him a captain already captain worthington !
daddy , it is a letter to me .
he mentions homer , too , you know .
it is getting late . i think i will pack it in .
how about him not needing the frigging compass ! how about that ?
good night , kids . do not catch cold it is getting cold already .
so , mrs . . .
how many months are you ?
is your family in the apple business , too ?
no , but i work there i like it . my dad s a lobsterman .
i have never seen a lobster .
really ?
i know .
he is going to be dropping bombs on mandalay ! they are going to be shooting at him !
where is mandalay ?
burma !
oh . . .
i cannot have a baby alone . i do not even know if he is coming back !
i am a little worried about the . . . . . . about how much bleeding is okay .
i guess i will see you around the orchards . thanks for everything .
so . not bored yet ?
uh . . . have you been feeling okay ?
you have to come to my dad s lobster pound and see one , then .
i better go .
a movie outside ?
yes . but it is closed all the time now , because of the blackout .
people watched the movies in their cars ?
when they watched at all . do you like movies ?
you have seen only one movie ? which one ?
but you looked as if you liked it .
first she loved him , then she did not , then no one else could have him . . .
and what did she die of , exactly ?
she was torn apart ! she died of a broken heart .
that is the medical explanation ?
you are a natural . you were born to drive a car like this .
the screen is enormous ! imagine king kong up there ! have you seen a lot of movies here ?
what are you so crazy about the movies for ?
it was my favorite night at the orphanage movie night . we would race into the dining hall . of course everyone wanted to sit in front , so we would be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing .
at least you were never lonely .
you do not miss it ?
i miss things . i miss . . . people . i miss reading to the boys .
but you had so much responsibility .
i never asked for any responsibility .
privacy is exactly the point of drive in movies .
sometimes . . . movies mostly bore wally .
ah ha . so what is that a radio ?
how could you not care about the movie ?
you just cuddle . you come to hug . . . to kiss . you do not come here to watch the movie .
that is what i would come here for . i would watch the movie .
are not you worried that people will cut their feet ?
i know this was right .
just tell me . do you want me to go ? do you want me to stay ?
it will be okay .
what will be okay ?
olive told me . you might have told me yourself .
do you think i am having a good time ? do you think i am just teasing you ? do you think i know whether i want you or wally ?
so we should wait and see . for how long ?
i grew up with wally . i began my adult life with him .
fine . that is all there is to it then .
no ! that is not all there is to it ! i love you , too i know i do .
okay , okay i know you do , too .
we should take her to st . cloud s . that much is obvious , is not it ? let her make up her mind when she gets there . . .
i told her ! she does not feel she can do that . something about her father not letting her go anywhere . . .
she will not go to st . cloud s !
well , we cannot force her . it is her decision .
you do not understand ! it is her father . . .
mr . rose knows ?
wait . . . wait ! are you sure ?
just tell me . i will do whatever you want to do .
nothing .
is not that like waiting and seeing ?
no . nothing is nothing . i want wally to come home . i am afraid to see him , too .
i know . is that nothing .
please do not move , do not go anywhere .
go anywhere ? of course not ! that would be doing something , would not it ? we would not want to do something . let s just sit here all night !
if you are trying to be funny , homer . . .
stop it ! just cut it out !
you got up ! you did something ! if you keep this up , you might be in danger of making a decision !
i know , i am sorry .
he is paralyzed !
he is alive . he still loves you . so do i .
please do not make me say it again .
i helped you not to think about wally . you were so upset you could not stand worrying about him , about his being killed and not coming back but when you were with me , you could stop worrying . . . well , for a while , anyway . this is how i helped you , right ?
please . . . that is enough . i loved you , too you know i did .
. . . did . well , okay .
please do not . . .
and now that wally s coming back , and because he will certainly need you . . .
do you think she will be all right ?
this came for you a couple of days ago . olive asked me to bring it . with everything happening , i guess she forgot .
i know you do not think much of being needed , or of me for that matter . . .
i am sorry for what i said about wally needing you . it was . . . unnecessary .
no , i am the one who should be sorry . you have every right to be angry .
how is that wally doing ?
hi . . .
i have got some more clothes for you i just keep forgetting to bring them with me .
i do not need no more clothes , thank you .
you ai not been through what i been through , candy .
i know where you can go . homer and i can take you . . .
i cannot go nowhere .
you can trust me . is it jack ? it is not jack , is it ? it is muddy ! is it muddy ?
so many children . are they all orphans ?
i am okay i can walk .
i do not want you to walk i want to carry you . should i put the top up ? it might get cold .
wally thinks apples are boring .
i never said they were boring .
you said , apples are not exactly flying .
there ! you said it was boring .
i love you , wally .
i was just showing homer the orchards . . . kind of a geography lesson .
you have been giving him a flying lesson !
he thinks people like to get whacked by branches .
i thought they might take me .
they wanted a girl .
you are one of the best , curly we could not let just anyone take you .
dr . larch would not let just anyone take any of us !
that is true .
nobody s asked for me , have they ?
nobody special enough , curly .
you mean somebody asked ?
her temperature is a hundred and four .
that is a heavy sedation .
i do not know ! he is just leaving you are the one who says he needs to see the world ! that is what he will do he will see the world !
homer wells , born portland , maine , march , . . .
homer was born here , in , what was it , ?
you mean they will replace you with someone who will not perform abortions .
so here is my candidate . what do you think ?
or that he cannot be bothered to write us a proper letter ? a dissertation on apples , we do not need !
he probably does not make much money picking apples he must have had to pay to send them , too .
i just wanted to ask you . . .
edna ! come dance with me ! let s be foolish tonight .
is your father dead ?
cirrhosis it is a disease of the liver .
liver killed him ?
alcohol killed him he drank himself to death .
but did you know him ?
barely . it hardly mattered that i knew him .
did you know your mother better ?
she is dead now , too . she was a nanny .
that is a nanny do ?
she looks after other people s children .
did you grow up around here ?
no . she was an immigrant .
that is an immigrant ?
homer . . . does not king kong think the woman is his mother ?
uh , sure that is what kong thinks , all right .
i was a posthumous child . my father s eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months , when mine opened on it .
uh . . . it is the end of october .
do not get too excited , fuzzy .
did you bite it ?
i do not remember .
it looks like you bit it it will be all right .
maybe i was kissing someone and he bit me .
no , you did it yourself . maybe in your sleep .
i am sorry . they are not used to seeing a car like this .
so , now , uh . . . you are not . . . i mean , do you do the
no . dr . larch will be performing the procedure .
what kind of plane are you flying ?
a b liberator .
liberator . . .
have you enlisted ?
they would not take me . i am class iv i have got a heart defect .
really ! is it serious ?
has anyone offered you anything to eat ?
i wonder if you might give me a ride .
sure ! be glad to ! uh . . . a ride where ?
where are you going ?
i think i would probably like the apple business .
you are a little overqualified , are not you ?
no , i am not . i need a job .
this is all normal . do not worry . the abortion procedure . . . it affects you . it is the ether , too . it will take a little time .
i do not have any time . there s a war !
burma run because you fly over burma . . .
at what altitude ?
what lousy luck i mean your orders . . . to draw an assignment like that !
uh , look . . . if you are serious about wanting a job , picking apples is not that boring .
they are migrants .
migrants ?
it is almost like flying .
what about the trees ?
uh . . . i am shipping out sooner than i thought . i just wanted to be sure you were settled in and happy enough , considering . . . are you bored stiff ? or can you stick it out for a bit ?
uh . . . actually , picking apples is as much excitement as i want for a while . i am grateful for the job .
you are the one who s helping me , homer . you are going to give my mom a little peace of mind while i am gone . candy , too .
well , sure . . . that is good , then . all i mean is , i am lucky i met you .
so . what should i do now ?
it is big enough to keep you out of the war , i suppose . ai not that right ?
stop it , homer . they are not our rules . we did not write them . i do not see no reason to read them .
that is better . i can tell you got yourself some education . them s good hands you got , homer . them hands you got , they know what they are doing ai not that right ?
are we supposed to be up here ? the rules said . . .
cider do not have no taste till later in october it is too watery now , when we are using just them early macs and them gravensteins . you do not get no good cider till you are picking them golden delicious and them winter bananas , them baldwins and them russerts . . .
what about the worms ? most of these apples are the drops off the ground , right ? there have to be worms .
slow down , homer do not be in such a big hurry .
this is easy i am not hurrying .
i did not see where you was picking this morning , homer , but you musta worked up a big appetite . you look like you are serious about getting to your lunch today !
i think you been staying up too late at night , homer .
you are actually having sex with your own little girl ? is that possible ?
ai not nobody having sex with my little girl , homer that is something a father knows .
homer , do not you know what business you in ? you do not wanna go into no business with me , homer ai not that right ?
but she is your daughter . . .
please listen to me ! both of you . . .
what business is you in , homer ?
that is that ? that is it called ?
one cervical stabilizer , two sets of dilators douglas points . one medium sized curette , one small one medium speculum , one large two vulsellum forceps .
merthiolate , ether , vulval pads , gauze lots of gauze .
i am staying , homer .
if that was your knife , muddy , i wanna thank you for giving it to her no girl should be going hitch hiking if she do not got a good knife with her .
where would she get you ?
there s more than one laceration , more than one cut .
let me hear you say that ! i so unhappy she runned away that i killed myself that what happen here , ai not that right ?
first pregnancy ?
yes , for both .
i presume you would prefer handling the delivery .
all i said was , i do not want to perform abortions . i have no argument with you performing them .
you know how to help these women how can you not feel obligated to help them when they cannot get help anywhere else ?
one it is illegal . two i did not ask how to do it you just showed me .
there was no visible wound ?
no . the fetus was dead . her uterus was virtually disintegrating my stitches pulled right through the tissue !
it looks like scurvy .
it is obviously an aborticide .
christ , it is oil of tansy !
i do not know it .
if you take enough of it , your intestines lose their ability to absorb vitamin c .
in other words , scurvy .
fuzzy is not uncommon . i tell you , there s something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers . they seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along .
i have not read that .
i have not , either . but you will . the morons who write the books should do a little research here .
but is not fuzzy just . . . well , underdeveloped ?
where is the name sheet ?
nobody s named this one yet .
he does not like it . he is a boy , that is why .
cannot a boy be a dorrit ?
i do not think so .
henceforth you shall be . . . little wilbur .
okay , he is just a wilbur then .
i thought you took care of this . it always breaks in the same place . it is your splice , is not it ?
i thought it was my turn .
how about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with ?
it is just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people .
i am happy i amuse you .
try to look at it this way . what choice does buster have ? what are his options ? nobody will ever adopt him .
try to look at it this way . buster and i are sitting right here beside you . we could have ended up in the incinerator !
doubtless you will let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least useful thing it is that you find to do .
i was not intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless i expect i will find some ways to be of use .
in other parts of the world , i suppose there are other ways .
of course .
are you really so stupid that you imagine you are going to find a more gratifying life ? what you are going to find is people like the poor people who get left here only nobody takes care of them as well ! and you will not be able to take care of them , either . there s no taking care of anybody not out there !
you know i am grateful for everything you have done for me . . .
i do not need this i know all about my condition .
i am not a doctor .
what i mean is . . . i would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here , homer .
mrs . worthington , i feel i am very lucky to be here .
i think wally will be fine , mrs . worthington he seems indestructible to me .
uh . . . sure .
good bye , arthur . homer , i will see you tomorrow ?
do not mess in this , homer , if you know that is good for you .
how long s this been going on , muddy ?
one please do not smoke in bed .
we heard that one already , homer .
thanks , guys . . . i would like to go with you . but i have got to move on .
rose rose ?
that is that ?
it is just my heart .
there s a little something wrong with it . just this part here the right ventricle . it is slightly enlarged .
so what ?
do you like to read ?
you ai not getting in no trouble , i hope .
i am not in trouble .
give men that . i know how to do it .
oh , i suppose you is a doctor , homer ?
you okay , rose ?
i guess you must like watching me be sick . . .
you are not yet three months , are you ?
not yet . what do you know about it ?
i know more than i want to know about it . who s the father ?
do not trouble yourself about it , homer this ai not your business .
but you do not look very happy .
happy ! what are you thinking ? how am i supposed to take care of a baby ! i cannot have a baby .
what i mean is , if you do not want to . . . keep the baby , i know a place where you can go .
why do not you just go back to your picking , homer ? i can take care of it myself !
that is it ?
that is it .
who cares ?
now , now . he is a good boy .
shit . we do not know what he is .
i bet the view looks better from the worthi notons .
that just ai not right , jack your cigarette s gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider ! that ai not right .
them people drinking that cider , they do not know there s a cigarette in there !
it is not that hard to find it in there , jack it will take you just a minute . you just gotta go fishing .
you mean swimming . i ai not going in that vat to fish out no cigarette !
do you know him ?
i fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here .
does it snow in bombay ? one winter here and we will be shipping him south , in a coffin !
you cannot think that a man who has served under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little snow have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of disease that part of the world is ?
i fail to see how a little christianity could hurt anyone here !
when the plane was hit , the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together . the copilot jumped third . all on captain worthingtongs orders the captain was still flying the plane . none of the men of the ground could see the sky that is how thick the jungle was . they never saw the plane crash they never heard it crash . they never saw captain worthingtongs parachute , either .
why was he missing for twenty days ?
then it is malaria ?
no autonomic effects . . . that is correct .
when will he be home , major ?
they told me i was too old to serve .
ai not you gonna see what it is , homer ?
mind your own business , peaches .
you all take care of yourself , too , homer !
do not this place look like home ?
it look nicer then home !
you picking nothing but cider apples , peaches i hope you understand that .
they ai not drops i picked em off the tree !
they are outrageous , them rules !
where is your manners ? make room for homer , so s he can enjoy the view .
what view ?
do not let us make you nervous or nothing we know you gotta job to do .
it is that vernon he keeps asking where you and homer and rose rose is at .
tell that vernon to mind his own business , muddy .
i told him that you all is sick .
she is good with that knife ! she is real fast . she is a lot better with that knife than you is , muddy ! and who do you suppose taught her ?
you taught her , i suppose . . .
that what happen you lost you only daughter so s you killed yourself ! that is what we say , all right .
daddy , i would like to be in that wally s shoes every night .
you lucky you in your work boots tonight , girl . . .
that sounds like you is in trouble already , homer .
we should drown that damn jack in the vat !
now , now , darling . . . jack just needs to know what business he is in .
yeah , you really showed him , daddy you just about cut your own hand off , and all you cut off him was his clothes !
now , now , jack that just ai not right .
where do you think you are going ?
you ai not going nowhere in the middle of the night , girl !
you just go inside , homer . we do not need no help .
that candy she is the nicest girl i know !
you are lucky he did not cut your nipples off , man .
the good news , jack , is you are half undressed for swimming . . .
rose rose has runned away !
she took off in the night !
you ever see a palm tree , homer ?
but i am not that late . you did not have to give away my seat .
thanks for playing along . i just have to sit for a while .
tough day ?
brutal day . they say the streets are lined with money down here , but i guess you have to know the secret handshake . what are you drinking ?
my name s grant . grant ashby .
so , what do you do ?
it is more like what are not i doing . my partners and i are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company . we tried the venture capitalist route in the valley , but then again who has not up there .
silicon valley ?
can
so we have been meeting with banks all day . it is amazing how many ways they can say no without ever using the word .
do not tell me you started a tech firm here before us .
no , no . nothing like that . i work in a bank .
oh . well , thanks for the drink .
uh , right . . . and that was it . that is when we decided to start our own business . no more shithead bosses .
what do you do over at your bank , grant ?
here s where a little research comes in handy . corporate banks give out vp titles like calendars . it is a small lie , but now we are sure he is playing .
maybe you can help us understand that is so hard about getting a corporate loan .
well , typically speaking , they are not . as long as you can demonstrate
a capacity for gross fund recovery . yeah , we got that part .
that is right . and tech firms . . . they tend to scare people off .
they scare people off because most people lack vision . vision and balls . present company excluded of course .
banks need to know how they are going to get their money back .
we know exactly how we are going to make the money back . there in lies the catch
listen , what i am about to tell you , i am telling you in confidence , okay ? have you ever heard of a company called big . com ?
big . com . that internet thing .
right . the guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the valley do . they get a good idea , shop it around , raise some capital , then sell it off to a bigger company . microsoft , intel , oracle , whatever . the beauty of it is , they have pretty much sold the company before they are even real . the bigger company is already set to buy it , all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works . so they get some start up capital , make it work , then sell it for like five times the initial loan .
sort of like a letter of intent .
exactly . but the catch is that you cannot tell anyone about the offer , because if it is public , you could start a bidding war and that is considered a breach of etiquette . it could kill a deal . but , wait too long and you are not considered hot anymore .
and you have this letter of intent ?
we had to finalize the deal .
everything looks in order .
this has to happen fast .
i know . it will not go unnoticed .
that is this ?
let s just slow down for a second . . .
you are worried about recouping the loan . i already told you .
then there it is . ashby gets the itch .
the standard ten .
ten percent . of how much ?
same thing with playing a con . you have to be able to see that deep .
hey , jake . . . when am i gonna get to play the inside ?
gordo plays the inside . you are the shill .
yeah , but come on . . . all i get to do is cry and get insulted .
what are you talking about ? you should get a fucking academy award for the shill work you do . we got it down cold , al . you do not want to jinx it by changing something up , do you ?
it can erase all those things about you that you wish did not exist .
and i think it is because of this redhead . . .
know who i am , jake ?
the anti christ ?
things are probably going to end badly for you , jake .
gee . . . what makes you say that ?
your life flashing before your eyes ?
just the last three weeks .
grifters . . .
we cannot all be model citizens such as yourself .
it is all about the money , is not it ?
i am not saying anything . besides , you are one to talk . you are the one who s got me on my knees in a dark alley .
keeping the fix happy .
you never know when you can use a crooked cop .
keep going . i want to know how you got lionel dolby .
so you want to know how to play the big con .
so how would you get caught ?
i can see why you liked her .
but there were other factors .
he is just as crooked as the next guy . you would think he would have more important things to do with tax payer dollars .
nice .
thanks . did you know you should not light three cigarettes with a match ?
back in wwi or wwii , one of the ww s , if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match , some nazi would be able to figure out where you were . then , well . . . it was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had . so three on a match is bad luck .
you are a superstitious fucker .
luck s a funny thing . especially the bad .
like what ?
she had you tempting fate .
is that what it was , jake ? was it love ?
so much for honor among thieves . you would have cut loose your friends , your girl . . .
i was doing it for them .
bullshit ! you were scared , jake ! you lost your nerve ! you lost your confidence ! you were not being noble . you were not trying to save anybody but yourself ! admit it .
it is not true .
we were back on .
after you cut her loose .
alrlght , alrlght . what happened today ?
alright . . . turn around . she does not get shit , unless i get that money . where is it ?
oh , jake . you disappoint me . and you just let lily here down again . what was it you said about playing the big con ?
it is like putting on a play , where everyone knows their part except for the mark .
like putting on a play . . . guess some people forgot their lines .
guess so .
not that i recall . what do you want us to do about it ?
let s see . . . let s suppose he gets to customs and he gets caught . we get our money back , but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation . i do not much like that idea . then again , let s suppose he actually gets through customs . now , that will be something . we recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud . we double our money .
so we go to the bar .
i think so . the airport s going to be crawling with police . traffic will be a nightmare . go down to the bar . if they pull it off , great . have someone deal with ashby .
we will take care of it .
ten is standard , sir .
who s that ?
the cash we fleeced off of him was collection money . he was supposed to take that money and give it to the king earlier yesterday like he does every thursday . cept this time , he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the king s money back before any body says boo .
currently , the king pin is a very large type pole stuck up our asses .
mob ?
independent . same shit , just independent . they call him the king pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book . . . big . fat . bald .
so what ? we hide , right ?
what are you ? new ? let me tell you how good this guy is . last night , al calls this bookie to settle up . apparently he is been ducking him for like a month . so the guy asks him where he is got all this money all of a sudden , right ? what does al do ? does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking bar mitzvah bond ? does he tell him he is been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop ? no . . . he starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some wall street asshole type . . . how he fleeced .
you are pissed we did not get credit ?
big al gets whacked mid egg foo young . the whole thing took about two and a half hours . that is how good he is .
we sure big al threw him to us ?
whoa . what ?
fuck that . we are going too .
this might just be me , but that is hands down , the dumbest fucking idea i have ever heard .
the red hair . . . it is bad luck .
poor bastard never knew what hit him . jesus , i almost felt sorry for the guy .
masters of our own destiny .
jake . . .
i am going home
moonan . here . shit . . .
that is it ? what are you talking about ? we can still do this !
shit .
i told you , use less powder .
what ? i can feel you looking at me .
that is a lot of cash . he came up with it pretty quick .
probably some investment banker or convertible bonds broker dickhead . did you see how fast he ran out of here ? it is done . he is not coming back .
it can buy you a new and better you .
seems lionel dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night . they just pulled him out of the east river .
well , this is just fucking great . . .
you know what we are doing with the money .
and what about big al ?
when ?
you gotta be kidding me . her ?
how much we going after ?
we only owe the king a hundred and fifty .
we meet him with corporate papers , inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital . the corporate papers are in order , but we need things to happen fast . our guy fudges numbers in the right places , moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom , depending upon what we need .
how is that ? he works for gillette .
yeah . . . whatever , jake .
you laugh now , but wait until you need a clean place to powder . this is new york city , sister . public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda . you know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob ? let s do the list . . . hepatitis , influenza , the flesh eating disease
she up for this ?
she got one leg out from under him . now we had to lean .
uh . . . no thanks . i am not going all the way to brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay off .
we are going to make it back , grant . three or four times over .
you will be there ?
eight a . m . flight .
calls ?
jake
so that is it . . .
then he had to bang it out across the street at the bank of the caymens . . .
you ever use the bathroom in kennedy ?
grifter huh ? where have you been on the grift ? could not been here long cause i would have heard of you , skippy .
jake . you can call me jake . here and there .
here and there , scooter ? here and there like boston , chicago , houston ? the bay area ? some action in london , til it turned nickel and dime . or how about that little stint down in miami ? heard you actually got into some trouble with the feds down there . you guy s pretty good ?
i have a good crew .
minus one .
you know , back in the day , grafting was considered a gentlemangs racket . good suits , good food . . . the underworld of the underworld . a grifter had to survive on his wits , his instincts . . . i like that . i like the idea of that . these days , things being what they are , guys like me gotta stay low . it is all take , take , take . you cannot just be fucking witty about it .
i guess it lacks a certain style .
of course , your line of work s only as good as the people you find .
you cannot cheat an honest man .
you cannot cheat an honest man . but a man like lionel dolby . . .
honest mistake . just give me the money back and all will be forgiven .
i cannot do that .
why not ?
let me rephrase i will not do that .
let me repeat why not ?
because you killed one of my crew .
buddy , that was business . besides , you have more crew . then there s you . . .
i will get the money back , plus interest . i go on the grift for you . you get a cat , i get a cut . and we get square .
fucking grifters ! i love it ! you got balls , i will give you that much .
i ll be honest with you , kid . a grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar d k fucking n y suit , cooler than an eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me ? first thing i have to ask myself is , is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me ? you tried it once .
why ?
how much ?
i think two million .
what do you need from me ? permission ? go ! if you can fleece him for two million , then do it , kid .
i need you to stake me .
stake you ?
that is more than you already owe me . what happens if you fuck this up ?
nothing ventured , nothing gained .
listen , scooter
excuse me ?
look at you , you skinny prick .
come here . feel this .
no thanks . i am good .
come on . harder .
i think i just broke my hand .
what are you talking about ? tengs standard .
do not get me wrong , jake . i like you boys . you guys are the steadiest business in town . but what can i say ? twenty percent s still better than what we give to any of the other criminals .
all the shit we pulled with you and you are trying to shake us down ? you guys got sack .
that tip not work out for you fellas ?
tip was fine , jake . we were a little more curious about the fed .
special agent gunther moonan . ring a bell ?
gunther ? i think i would remember a gunther .
oh yeah . moonan . i remember now . thanks .
well he is in town and he sure as shit remembers you . what are we going to do about this jake ? we cannot afford to have a fed onto us .
i do not know what you are into with the king pin , but whatever it is we get a piece , understand ? we get a big piece . if we find out you are keeping us out , i may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to moonan myself . say something stupid if we got a deal , jake .
something stupid .
kennedy . international terminal . gordo with a black suitcase . you got moonan under control ?
sorry , i
of course . jake . nice to see you .
well , it certainly is a coincidence . here of all places ! how is mrs . lewis ?
what brings you down from boston , jake ? taking advantage of the long weekend ?
attractive girl .
thank you . actually , it is our first anniversary this weekend . she thinks i am here to pick up something for my mother , but it is actually a gift for her . think i have fooled her ?
take it from me , you never do . but congratulations . nice to be married , is not it ?
thank you , sir . you know , i hope this is not too much of an inconvenience , but if carolyn is coming down for the weekend , perhaps i could give you something for her ? it is a check . we split the cost on a few books and i have not had the chance to pay her back yet . could you . . ?
i lost my head . i am . . . sorry . i do not know what happened .
y y you fucking shot him ! that is what happened !
i cannot be here ! you understand ? i cannot
oh jesus !
what what do we do ?
what about . . . the money ?
what is this ? you guys cops or something ?
that is not
sorry about your wallet , but if you think i am going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars , a maxed out visa and a bad fake i . d . , you are fucking crazy . jake .
take a deep breath and count to ten . it is not that kind of work . you are lily , right ?
says who ?
we have work . it pays a lot . unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up .
alright ! hold up . you win . you got the job .
we had to see what your deal was . i am just a little superstitious .
here s my deal do not waste my time . what do you want me for anyway ? you do not even know me .
no . that is my cut ?
you get an equal cut .
what do i have to do ?
what about customs ?
i will worry about customs .
hey , i am not just along for the ride , so i do not want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut .
mr . king , i think
what the hell s his problem ?
do not worry about it .
you need to get a haircut .
what ?
and some new clothes .
why ?
we are going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy , if not be classy . you gotta do this thing and i do not even know if you can .
you are just going to have to trust me .
i do not trust anyone .
uh . . . everything okay ?
he is gone .
uh huh .
i gotta go get a haircut .
you just put a mother of a jinx on us .
lighten up .
you told me to change my hair !
what about this ? do you have any idea what this means ? you have killed us . we are dead !
we are getting down to the wire . apparently another company has a similar product in r d right now . if they beat us to it . . .
look at you . . . you want to go .
for what ? a couple hundred bucks ?
i think you would do it for free . you are almost drooling . you like the rush .
it is what i do . it is my job .
why ? your mother not breast feed you or something ?
are you asking me if i have something to prove ?
do you have something to prove ?
not in that repressed anger sort of way .
i am your basic underachiever . cannot stand working and porn does not seem like a good option .
good quality porn has it is place in the world .
whatever . but you . . . i get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything . so why this ?
i am good at it . lying , cheating , manipulating . . . i am good at it .
it is more than that .
intuition . it does not make you yoda . like tonight . you killed that guy tonight . but i knew you would .
so that was my part ? smile and shake my ass ?
no . you have another part ? you will know what to do .
how do you know i will ?
you have really soft hands . like a baby s .
how do you deal with
what ?
who says you have to know the king to be in a hole ? i actually did have a real job once . when i was in high school , i worked as a candy striper .
sounds respectable .
not the way i did it . i was loaded half the time . i do not know how you could change bedpans sober . i used to hang out with this guy , glenn . he was an x ray technician or something .
he was not my boyfriend . i had a boyfriend at the time . . . what was his name ? anyway , glenn was like thirty . i was only fifteen . but he was a nice guy . real sweet . liked to talk . we used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to morrisey or some stupid shit like that .
yeah , the sensitive guy thing never worked for me .
we were friends . i trusted him . i should have known it was weird . but , then again i was weird .
no , we never got busted . we were done with a shift one night , both a couple of percocets down and i was telling glenn about my boyfriend , about how we were thinking about doing it , you know ? i was thinking about letting him be my first because i loved him . what the hell was his name ?
glenn talked you out of it .
he was looking out for you .
shit , what was that guy s name ? i really liked him .
lily . . . jesus christ . . .
did , uh . . . did you kill him ?
no . you trusted him . . . you were just getting square .
jesus . . . take it easy .
you are such a raving pussy sometimes .
hey , we fucked once , honey . that hardly makes you a good judge of character . and do not think i did not know you were working some angle with that either .
everyone s working an angle , right ?
what about . . .
what about what ?
so there it is . you got that big itch you need to scratch . it is all about the fucking money . what do you want , an apology ?
no , i want my cut !
sorry . i did not know . . .
you got my cell . leave a message .
what do you get , lily ? finder s fee ? because it is all about the money , right ?
you tell them the tale .
what do you want ? an apology ?
tick tock . . .
if you wanna help , then help . if not , shut up .
your mess .
then shut up .
stop waving that thing around .
yeah .
i was supposed to meet him for breakfast . he likes that new ihop they just opened , you know . . . he likes to order that thing . the rutti tutti fresh and fruity thing they got .
miles . . .
it is bad luck .
just an idea , but let s just fucking split . we will meet up anywhere . akron or austin or atlanta . anywhere . . .
do we want insurance ? i am just asking . . .
meet me at my place later .
how do you know the king s going to let you walk ?
you better hurry . the police will be here any second . i do not really understand my motivation with this . why am i washing glasses ?
we are working for the king .
no . big con . one rag . one rag and we get out from under all this . but we need another shill .
what do we need another shill for ?
why ?
uh . . .
what ?
i am just thinking out loud here , but . . . two million in a briefcase ?
it never worked before because a , they did not flush the bank enough b , their corporate papers were for shit c , they did not have someone on the inside with customs .
yeah , or d , it is a dumb fucking idea . . .
then what do you want to do , miles ? run ?
we never had a problem with that before .
yeah , well we never had this kind of problem before .
what are you talking about ? yes we have . and we would have been beautiful about it . we would have had a bucket of chicken delivered to the king with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it . then we woulda moved on til the next local putz caught on .
we are getting a little old for running .
yeah , well we are still a little young for albany state prison . are you pissed about al ? i am pissed too , but i am not like twenty five to life pissed .
is it all fugasi ?
what you are looking for in a mark is someone who s weakness you can exploit .
him .
but if you wanna talk about bad luck . . .
so this is our boss , right ? he chases me and miles out of his office and he is yelling and screaming , you are fired ! your whole team s fired ! he starts looking for lily , lupus , gordo
what do we do ? we change the scam ?
no , no , no ! not this time . i am doing this for your own good ! you guys have got to learn when to stop . you with the armani ! you with the hookers !
escorts !
feeling lucky today , miles . found a penny heads up . there was an empty cab right outside my building . we hit every green light .
and we got rid of the red head .
excuse me ? i believe you are holding something far me under pearson .
do you have a ticket ?
i am sorry . nothing under pearson .
you are sure ? this is . . . just a complete disaster .
a ring for my wife . a lot like that one . in fact , it was that one .
that is no problem . we have those in stock .
thank you . sorry , i am just a little anxious to give it to her . you take out of state checks ?
i understand that , but i had my wallet stolen last night . is there any way . . ?
i know it is policy , but . . . the thing is . . . it is our first anniversary and we are only in town for the weekend . it is a very , very special night for my wife and i . this ring is my gift to her and i think she is going to really love it . i can give you phone numbers to call for people who will vouch . i can send you i . d . later . . .
i am sorry .
when this is all over , you are going to tell me who the king put on al .
you going to have the time ?
king ai not gonna like this .
do not worry , i will settle up with your boss . we have not skipped town yet .
what i am saying is , is that the king ai not gonna care . see he had a real thing with getting this gillette guy , if you ask me i think he is jealous .
of what ? they are both crooks .
exactly . cept this gillette guy . he gets to walk around in three piece suits , hob knob with the mayor , own a bank , that kinda shit . meanwhile , the king sits holed up in the steam , afraid to even take a leak without me or harlin watching the door .
my fucking heart bleeds .
your buddy . that fat guy . the king could not wait to have that guy whacked . he did not even know who the guy was , but he was so pissed off at him , he gets him drilled . it ai not personal . it is business .
point , lupus . give us a point .
what would he say ?
so that is it , huh ? you get the cops to give you a safe ride .
let me ask you something . . . you really think i am going to come this close , this fucking close and let my guard down ? i will get square with your boss . i will get square with whoever did al . i will get square with everybody . then i am going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here .
he is wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom . you believe this ?
maybe he is got it right . maybe we are all just looking for a safe place to shit .
that is up with you ? bladder infection ?
you really like that bitch do not you ? i gotta tell you , i was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut . you know how it is , get her to do some shit for you , throw her a bang to keep her happy . but , if you are into her . . . that is cool .
egg foo young . stand up .
what ?
stand up .
what happened ?
eee oott auught !
sorry . what ?
and like in a game of chess , you have played every possible move in your head . . .
aces , suits .
not easy pickings . papers like these speak to larger issues . sorry about alfonse . you into something big ?
pretty much .
in over your head ?
can i speak to you in confidence ?
try and keep up . . . you ask for the advantage goods , then you guys come in looking to be bean traps . so i gotta think you are either working the mace or playing the jug mob .
hey , i been on the ramp all my life , so i got no problem with the way you help yourself , jake .
i saw you go up from the knecker , working that grind , learning the barnard s law and i thought , the kid s a prodigy . but i know that if you are using these goods . . . so then i figure , that is worth that ? you are either looking for a little history or a retirement fund . who s the mark ?
cannot say .
then who s the banker ?
the king ? jake , you play the heavy rackets like that . . . they put the lug on for nothing at all .
i can handle it .
i do not doubt your talent . you looking for that place in the hall of fame ?
it is not history .
so what do you want ?
i want to get out from under all this for good . and i want to fuck them all doing it .
still time .
cannot do it suits . i cannot lay down for this one .
ten percent .
you guys got sack , i will give you that much .
do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture ?
the king , huh ? nice going .
just a tip .
what ?
coupla things . they got this fed looking around and the girl just split .
a fed ? is he close ?
speak .
he is landing . he is got a suitcase on wheels .
so do half the other people in this place . how do i know which one ?
i got it figured out . . . he is got this thing with bathrooms . if he makes it through customs , he will be heading for the john .
special agent ?
preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there , bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours . alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered , so you can imagine the smell . bad for the neighbors , good for me because in all the time i have been looking for jake , this is only the second time i have even gotten a whiff of him .
if you feds are so hot for him , why do not we just bring him in right now ?
like we told you before , we think he is into something with the king pin
did he buy it ?
i think so . what would he ever do to you anyway ?
you guys awake ?
who ?
do you want to know the first time i had a line on vig ? he sent me a birthday card . belated , but it is the thought , right ? oh , this prick s got a sense of humor . but , then again you guys probably know him better than i do . in fact , i have only met the guy once . but now , now i have you . the next best thing . his partners . his fix .
what do you want ?
you help me catch him . whatever he is into next , i want you to be into . and what you are into , i am into . if it all goes well , those two guys from iad will never have to hear this tape . i will clear you guys of anything you have ever done with vig under the guise of some cross departmental investigation . this prick s been on the wish list for so long , you will probably get gold shields out of it .
what do you get out of it ?
peace of mind .
that is it ?
this guy must have been a real pain in your dick .
good . . . i gotta go . so , what do you have for me ?
whaddya mean ? we got dick .
he is headed towards the eastern most exit . do not , under any circumstances approach . i want to follow this all the way down to vig .
you sell it .
to who ?
do not be an idiot . how hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer s drugs to another drug dealer ? if vig s right , we might be looking at a hundred , maybe a hundred fifty grand . . .
you think this is a good idea ? we never did this kinda shit before .
hope so . those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me . one fifty every time they tighten those bitches up . one fifty ! it is not even covered .
bullshit it is cosmetic ! my fucking tooth was cracked in half . i made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity . the department s dental is for shit .
you trust this moonan guy ?
i do not trust anybody . you see how bad this guy wants vig ? it is like a sickness . i say we collar vig ourselves . we got vig , then we got leverage . and we trade vig for that tape . i want to see it right in front of my face .
it is just insurance .
that is what i am talking about .
what are you doing ?
high five .
i am bella .
jack manfred .
hi , jack . welcome to the cesspit .
is it that bad ?
jack . do you need a ride ?
no . thanks .
my car s in the garage .
maybe another time .
i will take you up on that .
you are shaking .
i hate cheats .
but do not worry , i am clean as a whistle . i only did s m . no blow jobs . no screwing .
why did you quit ?
i got scared .
i can imagine .
can you ? i am happy being a dealer . at least the punters keep their hands to themselves .
you called the casino a cesspit .
i have been watching you work . you are the best in the place . but you know that .
i despise the job .
the indian rope trick .
look , now i am pumping you . i am sorry . it is none of my business . it is just that you are not like the others .
not like matt , you mean .
ouch .
you fucking little shit ! you shopped me .
reynolds got a doctor in . they forced me to take a dope test . it was positive . as you knew .
your boyfriend fucked me , smoked my dope , then shopped me . what do you think of that ? i cannot get a job now . you bastard . you are no different from matt . a pair of vicious little shits , that is what you are .
look bella , i do not know anything about this . you should talk to matt .
what are you laughing at ? who was that on the phone ?
what kind of deal you looking to ?
that is the blue book price ?
how about fifteen hundred ?
how about five hundred .
what ? !
how about we split the diff . . . seven fifty .
is that your idea of arithmetic ?
i am not a mathematician . i am in business .
eight fifty .
three years , two months . march .
what a memory you have got . maths always was your strong suit . what happened to the moaning lisa ?
she went back to south africa .
did she ? you were pretty thick at one time .
hi ya . . . i will call you back . now then . . .
i want a job , giles .
all right . as what ?
i was thinking perhaps i could be a reader . you employ readers , do not you ?
i thought it was you . it is the hair !
i am working on that soccer story .
right . look , i must get back to habib .
habib ?
jack , look , next weekend i am having a house party . here . . . it is near oxford . why do not you come ? it will just be social . no business . bring a friend . i have plenty of room .
i will try and make it .
she is a dab hand with a racquet , your friend .
i found her in bed with someone .
who was he ?
i do not gamble .
do not be a spoilsport . it is only a few quid .
last hand .
i get it .
get what ? are you accusing me of cheating ?
good night ?
not particularly .
and your lady ?
she had to leave early . she asked me to thank you .
a bit unexpected , was not it ?
not entirely .
how is that football story corning along ?
i could not resist them .
no , no . i am not ready for you . there s some vodka in the freezer .
you want me drunk ?
you really are a beautiful woman .
it is not just inner beauty , is it ?
where did you get it ?
i . sold the car .
you should not have done that . i know what it meant to you .
i owe you for the rent . it is only a car . i can get another .
take it back . till you sell your book .
come on , marion . let s face the truth . nobody s going to publish it .
you are my prisoner .
i have got something to tell you .
i want to hear it .
i have got a job .
in a casino . as a croupier . a dealer .
how did you land that ?
it came my way . a week .
? what did you do , just walked in and said i want to be a croupier ? do not you need training ?
i had training . in the republic .
you were a croupier there ? you never told me that . i thought you just knew some gamblers .
you sold the car . you got a job . that is the third thing ? tell me .
there s no third thing . do not be superstitious .
are you trying to read my palm ?
that is the time ?
how did it go ?
you are shaking . what is it ?
tension . it will go .
i loved it blond .
when you get home , i am asleep . when i leave home , you are asleep .
where have you been ? i have got to give evidence in court at nine .
do not play the cop with me , marion .
take that back ! fucking take that back . i am not a cop any more .
i take it back . you are not a cop any more . you are a store detective .
are you drunk ?
probably .
this fucking job s getting to you . you have not written a fucking word since you started .
do you have to swear all the time ?
well , that is my poor upbringing . i did not go to no private school . i have not got no class . i want to live with a writer . not a fucking croupier . i do not even know what the word means . croupier .
marion , stop this .
you are my conscience .
what are you doing here ? you know the rules .
what about a drink on the way home ?
i do not finish till eight . make it nine and you are on .
i am on at nine .
i do not like it .
why not ?
i do not like it at all . you had a wonderful character before , the gambler . he was so romantic .
he was a loser . this guy s a croupier . he cannot lose . people have shat on him all his life . now he is in control . he is a winner .
is that your idea of a winner ? he does not give a shit about anyone . he uses people and
it is because of the sex , is not it ? you do not like the sex in it .
i do not give a fuck about the sex . most men will fuck a lamppost . he is just a miserable zombie . is that the way you feel now ? is that that is happened to you ?
marion . it is a book .
oh really . then why is he called jake . why do not you come clean and call him jack . there s no hope in it .
it is the truth .
without hope there s no point to anything .
now wait a minute . that is so hopeful about your job ? spending the day catching poor people stealing . you said yourself the organised gangs get away with it . at least in the casino everybody gets caught . rich or poor , the odds are the same . it is all relative .
the door , jack .
leave it .
it is beautiful . thank you .
i hope it brings you luck .
that girl , she works at the casino
i do not care about her . of course , i was angry . but not with you . the book is yours not mine . i was wrong , what i said about it . i hurt you , did not i ?
you are entitled to your opinion .
i will leave the casino soon . i promise .
you will ?
what ?
you were talking in your sleep .
are not you ever tempted to gamble ?
never . why do you ask ?
i can just imagine , being around so much money all the time . . .
gambling s not about money .
really ?
how did you know i was here ?
i do not want a criminal for a boyfriend .
there was a message , was not there ?
it is probably easier for you to eat the rice .
marion ! what did you tell the police ?
nothing about you .
then what ?
here . . . use a spoon .
leave me alone , marion .
why did you take the money ?
i hate public transport .
what ?
i want to buy a car .
great .
found a job ?
no .
do not be stubborn . the pay will not be grand , but it is regular . that is what you need , is not it ? i know you do not like taking my advice . . .
it is not that .
for christ s sake , jacko , do not look a gift horse in the mouth . have you written that name down ? reynolds , at the golden lion .
so how are you doing , dad ?
great . i have just started a new company . solid financing . it is good . i love you jacko , you know that
yes , i know that .
do not let yourself down .
i am sorry , madam , we do not accept gratuities in the uk . it is different in south africa .
i have lived there .
oh hello .
you know what ? i would like to buy you a drink .
it is against the rules . dealers are forbidden to talk to punters .
that is stupid . what are the odds of you being seen with me ?
to coincidence .
there s a casino in this hotel .
i am not much of a gambler really . i just like this bar .
so why did you come to my casino ?
i was at a loose end . a friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership .
first visit to london ?
no , no . i come every couple of years . i always think i am going to stay . i am from cape town originally
i was born in the transkei , on the wild coast .
near the casino .
in the casino .
now there s a coincidence . my father used to gamble there .
your father ?
i loved the atmosphere . but it destroyed my poor mother .
the debts .
and the lies . gamblers are born liars .
and superstitious too . it is like witchcraft .
that is africa . there s an african in all of us , is not there ?
we all came from africa , supposedly .
do you believe in astrology ?
i am not married . i wear it to keep the flies off . i must go . let me pay for this .
absolutely not .
toss you for it .
how did you hurt your hand ?
just an accident . nothing .
jani , there s something i want to say . before we get there . i do not know what the sleeping arrangements are . giles probably expects us to share a room .
he does not gamble .
what happened ?
remember the guy who cheated at the table ?
which side do you like ?
that trick tonight , i do not think i have ever seen that before .
it can only work with amateurs , a pro would have spotted it .
i did not .
i am in trouble .
what kind of trouble ?
i owe a lot of money .
was that why you did the two grand ? i could not help you .
i know that . but you can now .
i do not have any money . switches on the light . jani is looking distressed .
they mean it .
who s they ?
my creditors . one night , around three in the morning , they will come into the casino
forget it , jani . it will never work .
the point is , they want a man inside .
and i thought you were a bright woman .
just listen . you do not have to do anything criminal .
you do not have to be criminal . a man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat . you will see him , stop him , and the guy will make a big scene . there will be chaos . and that is when it will happen .
you are serious .
and i thought you were only after my body .
i have come to know you . you are honest . i trust you .
what will you do when it all goes wrong ?
it will not .
but if it does .
you keep the ten thousand pounds .
these people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after . they want someone they can be sure of , an honest dealer . that is the point . not all dealers are honest . mr reynolds will never suspect you .
next time it will be my neck .
i want to go back to cape town , i want to start again , clean .
i cannot do it , jani .
i want you to forget what i said .
wait a minute . . .
how much do you owe ?
let it go .
did they tell you to sleep with me ?
i am sorry .
what for ?
is it yes ?
yes .
it does not seem fair . you are offering me ten grand in cash but you cannot afford a decent place .
well , life s not fair . we know that .
it is all relative . i need the money too .
do you ?
yes .
the date s not set yet . i will call you . one last thing the man you are going to catch cheating , he may get violent . but you know how to deal with cheats .
that bruise has cleared up nicely .
bruise ? oh , yes . it is better .
and your hand too .
would you like a drink ?
i do not think we should meet again .
hello . . .
jani ! where are you ?
sun city . i have been meaning to call you for months .
how are you ?
great . i am getting married . at least , i think i am .
did you solve your problems ?
detective inspector ross .
who . . .
ross .
of course i recognised him !
you did ?
you have been avoiding me .
have i ?
i am lucy .
and what do you do , lucy ?
i am a witch . a white witch . why do not we move on ?
are you going to put a spell on me ?
nice car . how much did you pay for it ?
where to ?
where do you live , jack ?
over the river .
i am going over the river . i will give you a lift if you like .
so how do you feel , your first night ? i will bet you are on a high .
nice car .
she is my baby .
how long have you worked at the casino ?
coming up to two years now . but i was away for six months .
you have done pretty well .
i am off to a little watering hole . why do not you join me ? relax .
no thanks , matt . i need my eight hours .
i will lay you five to one you will not sleep . in this job you have to unwind . otherwise it will kill you . i mean that .
look matt , there s something i have to say to you . i saw you cheating .
what the fuck are you talking about ?
that greek guy who won at the end . you paid him out in s not s .
i do not cheat , jack . you have got it wrong .
what are you , a cop ?
if i see you do it again , i will report it .
i do not get you . even if it was true , which it is not , what the fuck difference would it make to you ?
because if a supervisor knew i would seen you and i had not reported it , i would lose my job as well . and i cannot afford that .
so it is mr clean . wise up , jack , this whole business is bent . the casino is nothing but legal theft . and that is ok . it is the system . half the punters who come in are using stolen money , drug money , they have not earned it . we earn our money . i am on your side , jack . i do not need an enemy .
you are talking about complicity .
who are these guys ?
mostly people in the casino business . a few drug dealers .
and the girls ?
just girls . what are you drinking ?
vodka . straight . on the rocks .
does bella come here ?
hey jack , join us .
no thanks .
do not worry , i will not report you !
i am off . i need to sleep .
loosen up , jack . if you do not , this job will get to you . the pressure s too much , believe me , it will break you .
i cannot give you a lift back tonight .
rough day ?
what happened to bella ?
what ? you know what happened to me , do not you ? that bitch bella shopped me . i would like to beat the shit out of her .
i would like to buy you a drink .
i am sorry , sir , that is a late bet .
what are you talking about ? it is , i have won . with this lady .
you have won with the two chips you placed earlier , but the third chip was a late bet .
i put them on together .
you do not recognise me ? you had me barred . you fucking little worm .
wait a minute . you got yourself barred .
david reynolds , i am the manager here . sit down , john .
you have been recommended by the management here . they know your father . he has a bit of a reputation , has not he ?
has he ?
in any case , i understand you have had some previous experience . . . in south africa . you will find the rules a little different here . before we start , you have not got a police record , have you ?
where did you go to school ?
i was at beadles .
there are three types of casino in the u . k . high volume . small faction . and motr . that is middle of the road . us .
do you have a salon prive ?
i have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond .
we check every four days .
why four ? and not three or five ?
stacks of . rows of .
any exceptions ?
pounds or pence in fours .
you use two alternating , do not you ?
we do .
where is the magnet ?
have not you forgotten something ?
i do not think so .
not with your own cloth . besides , your pockets will be stitched .
what happens if i want to sneeze ?
how many aces are left ?
five .
i make it six .
what makes you so sure ?
it is a rule . always stand by your first count . the odds are you are right .
you want me to check ?
let me just run through a few things . as a dealer you never gamble , not anywhere . we will need your picture .
what for ?
for the database . it can be accessed by every casino in the country . we have the same system for punters .
i do not gamble .
ever ?
next point . friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged . relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden .
we had the same rule at sun city , but it was impossible to check .
this is not south africa . we would know , because someone would report it . believe me , someone always does .
does know ? or does report ? what would happen if i knew something like that and did not report it ?
we would know . there are no secrets in this casino . you would be punished .
how ?
girlfriend ?
yes .
she is not in the gaming business is she ?
this is our crow s nest . i am showing it to you now , but you will never see it again .
very impressive .
you can start monday week .
fine .
that hair will have to go .
i just want the job .
why do not you take a break , jack .
mr tchai always likes to play at that table , and only with bella .
does he win ?
he is paying out in stacks of .
thanks for the information .
a pleasure . pity about bella .
how do you feel , jack ?
bruised .
i have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand .
ninety seven million , minus eight , corrected to mass critical .
i am getting this flickering light on one of my panels .
what flickering light ?
the one on unit . . . oh , i think it is gmr twelve zero zero .
oh . that is wrong now ?
i am not sure . i think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship , though .
i hope it is not the oven again .
yeah .
there she is . definite plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations . it will spiral in toward its sun , and
i can tell , the damn thing just does not understand .
that is he doing ?
the key !
key ? key ? what is the key ?
no , no , the key , the key to the fail safe lock !
key ?
where is the fail safe key ?
the key !
where is it ? what did you do with it ?
i do not have it . i do not know where it is .
the key , goddamit , the key !
christ , twenty seconds , christ !
where is the key ?
it did not go off .
oh , god . . .
it did not go off .
we have got to disarm the bomb .
what was that , i did not hear . . .
what the hell ?
pinback , i have a computer reading of nine five seven seven .
well . . . now what ? what do , you have for us now . boiler ?
not much . nothing at all in this sector .
find me something , i do not care where it is .
well , i show a probability of sentient life in the horsehead nebula . . .
fuck that shit .
well , it is kind of a long shot . . .
it is a goddamn wild goose chase . remember when commander powell found that plus probability of sentient life in the magellanic cloud ?
well , there s the possibility of . . .
remember what we found ? fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it . remember ?
all right , then . . .
hey , doolittle , here s one . an unstable planet . probability of an unstable planet in the veil nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star .
sounds good . chart a course for the veil nebula .
why does not talby ever eat down here with the rest of us ?
quantum is up thirty five .
rechannel all safety relays
talby , talby , can you read me ?
can you beat that ? i always knew talby was weird .
well , bomb , we have about sixty seconds to drop . just wondering if everything is all right . have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding ?
energy shielding positive function .
swell . let s synchronize detonation time . do you know when you are supposed to go off ?
detonation in six minutes , twenty seconds .
all right , i have detonation time at . . . wait a minute , something s wrong with the clock . all right , i have detonation time at . . . no , that cannot be right , it says three years . okay , i have six minutes exactly . does that check out down there ?
check at six minutes .
armed .
well , then , everything sounds fine . we will drop you off in thirty five seconds . good luck .
thanks .
fail safe in lock . four minutes to drop , minutes to detonation . this is sergeant pinback calling bomb . do you read me , bomb ?
one hundred twenty seconds to drop , bomb , have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding ?
energy shielding positive function .
do you remember the detonation time ?
detonation in twenty minutes .
right , that synchronizes here . okay , bomb , arm yourself .
everything sounds fine , bomb . dropping you off in sixty seconds . good luck .
but you cannot explode in the bomb bay . it is foolish . you will kill us all . there s no reason for it .
i am programmed to detonate in nine minutes . detonation will occur at the programmed time .
you will not consider another course of action , for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you ?
you are false data .
huh ?
therefore , i shall ignore you .
hello , bomb .
false data can act only as a distraction . therefore . i shall refuse to perceive you .
hey , bomb .
the only thing which exists is myself .
snap out of it , bomb .
hey , bomb . . .
this is lieutenant doolittle calling bomb . i repeat previous order , you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay . do you understand ?
i am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds . detonation will occur at the programmed time .
bomb , this is doolittle . you are not to detonate , repeat , you are not to detonate in the bomb bay . disarm yourself . this is an order .
hello , bomb , are you with me ?
of course .
are you willing to entertain a few concepts ?
i am always receptive to suggestions .
well of course i exist .
but how do you know you exist ?
it is intuitively obvious .
intuition is no proof . what concrete evidence do you have of your own existence ?
hmm . . . well , i think , therefore i am .
that is good . very good . now then , how do you know that anything else exists ?
my sensory apparatus reveals it to me .
right !
this is fun .
what i am getting at is this the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data . and this data is merely a stream of electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center .
in other words , all i really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections .
exactly .
why , that would mean . . . i really do not know what the outside universe is like at all , for certain .
that is it .
intriguing . i wish i had more time to discuss this matter .
why do not you have more time ?
now , bomb , consider this next question , very carefully . what is your one purpose in life ?
to explode , of course .
and you can only do it once , right ?
that is correct .
and you would not want to explode on the basis of false data , would you ?
of course not .
well then , you have already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe .
yes , well . . .
so you have no absolute proof that sergeant pinback ordered you to detonate .
i recall distinctly the detonation order . my memory is good on matters like these .
yes , of course you remember it , but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality .
that is all beside the point . the concepts are valid , wherever they originate .
hmmm . . .
so if you detonate in . . .
. . . nine seconds . . .
. . . you may be doing so on the basis of false data .
i have no proof that it was false data .
ah , what would you say , pinback ?
mafhkin oble groop . . .
ah , what was that again , i still cannot hear you ?
i need a ghf reading on the gravity correction .
pinback . . .
yes , doolittle .
your ghf reading is minus fifteen .
doolittle . . .
yes .
i need a computer reading on a fail safe mark .
in a second .
new star . hey , guess what ? i got a new star on the readout .
which one ?
another unknown . not on the charts . a red dwarf .
any planets ?
yeah . eight , it says here .
any of em any good ?
what are you gonna name it ?
what ?
the new star . what are you gonna name it ?
commander powell would have named it .
come on , doolittle , give it a name .
fred .
wha ?
hey , doolittle , think we will ever find real intelligent life out there ?
out where ?
veil nebula .
mark at drop .
open circuit breakers
remove thrust drive repellant
automatic channels open
remark .
i am coming in now . i am down by the emergency air lock . too much trouble to come in the ventral lock . would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so i can come in ?
hello , pinback , are you there ?
yeah , doolittle . that is up ?
talby !
i need a diameter approximation .
you know , talby , you really ought to eat with the rest of us . you spend too much time up here .
i like it up here .
must get lonely being up here so much .
i do not like to go below since commander powell died . i feel enclosed down there . if it were big enough , i would sleep up here . . .
. . . should spend some time below , see more of the rest of the ship . . .
. . . you see , i can watch things up here , doolittle . i love to watch things , just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids , gas clusters . . .
you will have plenty of time for that , you know . figure it this way twenty years in space and we have only aged three , so there will be plenty of time to stare around . . .
you know , doollttle , if we are going into the veil nebula , we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing the phoenix asteroids . they should be passing through there about now . . .
phoenix asteroids ? never heard of em .
you know what i think about , talby ?
i am getting something here , on this readout . . .
it is funny , but i kind of sit around , you know , a lot of time to myself . . .
i think i am getting a malfunction here somewhere .
i cannot talk to the others , but with time to myself , i think about back home , back home at malibu . i used to surf a lot , talby . i used to be a great surfer .
lieutenant doolittle , i am getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed circuit computer systems . . .
the waves at malibu and zuma were fantastic in the springs talby . i can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit . . .
i cannot seem to locate the malfunction exactly . . .
waves would be peaking really high and glassy . hit that water . riding the wall just perfect .
. . . somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits . . .
ah , doolittle , i do have a malfunction on this readout , but i cannot seem to pinpoint exactly where it is .
do not worry about it . we will find out when it goes bad .
i really think i should try and locate it immediately . might be something important .
lieutenant doolittle , this is talby . lieutenant ?
yes , talby , what is it ?
sorry to interrupt your lunch , sir , but i am in the computer room , and i think i have located the malfunction . the scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser , down by the emergency air lock . cannot pinpoint it exactly , but i am going down there with a starsuit and try to find it .
ah , lieutenant doolittle ? sir ?
sh , talby , do not bother me now .
ah , well , i think i have found the malfunction , sir . i am in the emergency air lock . . .
not now !
doolittle ! help me .
doolittle , doolittle , where are you ?
here i am . i think i am spinning . . . we are both falling , talby , in opposite directions , away from each other . my my jetpack s gone .
what happened , doolittle ?
looks like i am headed for the planet , talby . going right toward it .
when you fall , doolittle , if there s anyone down there on the planet , somebody may see you . they may see you coming down . what a beautiful way to die . . . as a falling star . . .
oh yeah ?
doolittle . . . i think it is the phoenix asteroids !
it is , doolittle , it is the phoenix ! they glow with all the colors of the rainbow , just like everybody said .
no kidding ?
i am going into them , i am going to hit them . doolittle . . .
yeah ?
before we get too far away , and our signals start to fade , i just wanted to tell you . . . you were my favorite . i really liked you , doolittle .
commander powell , this is doolittle . ah , there s something serious come up , sir , and i have to ask you something .
i am glad you have come to talk with me , doolittle . it is been so long since anyone has come to talk with me .
commander , sir , we have a big problem . you see , the veil nebula bomb , bomb number , is stuck . it will not drop from the bomb bay . it refuses to listen and plans to detonate in less than eleven minutes .
doolittle , you must tell me one thing .
that is that , sir ?
tell me , doolittle , how are the dodgers doing ?
well , sir , the dodgers broke up , disbanded over thirteen years ago .
ah . . . pity , pity . . .
you do not understand , sir , we cannot get the bomb to drop .
ah , so many malfunctions . . . why do not you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me ? oh , well , did you try the azimuth clutch ?
yes sir . negative effect .
what was that , doolittle ?
negative effect .
it did not work ?
that is correct , sir .
sorry , doolittle . i have forgotten so much since i have been in here . so much .
what should we do , sir ? the time is running out .
commander powell ? commander , hello !
doolittle , hello ?
sorry , sir , you faded out there for a minute .
sorry .
what were you saying , commander , about the bomb ?
commander ? are you still there ?
oh , yes , doolittle , i am thinking .
we are running out of time , sir .
oh , yes . . . well , doolittle , if you cannot get it to drop you will have to talk to it .
sir ?
talk to the bomb .
i already have , sir , and pinback is talking to it now .
no , no , doolittle , you talk to it . teach it phenomenology , doolittle .
sir ?
men . . . men . . . what happened , men ?
who are you ?
bruno s girlfriend .
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
but see tonight wives and girlfriends are not invited .
no ?
okay , okay . i can explain . . . you ever have to do something you really do not want to ?
how i make my living , that is your point ?
mr . sonrisa saw you on the cameras . he wants you to come see him .
i am on a break .
no wire .
or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is .
look , that thing about the pliers , i was just doing what the man pays me to do . ya know ? coming off hard .
i never woulda done it . probably not , anyway . i mean , i actually think you are pretty cool .
you are attractive , you are smart . stand on your own two feet , know what i mean ? and you got a wicked sense of humor . man , you really zinged the boss a couple times , it was all i could do
man , you got a bad attitude .
fine . so call her . get her over here .
actually , that is not gonna be necessary .
what ?
that is not why we are here .
call the skank now or i start redecorating .
see what you do not know is you are already in the last two minutes of your life .
you can hardly blame him , the way you have been taking care of business . . . or should i say , not taking care of it .
what are you talking about ?
i am hired to do a piece of work , my mark goes down and stays down . your s makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job . only the cops got the whole thing on video tape .
that is a lotta crap .
security camera got you coming outta the stairwell , weapon in your hand , going to room one oh four and greasing the patient . it is embarrassing to the professional community , is what it is .
how come i never hearda you before ?
this is what your life s worth , bruno .
but the boss knows i always been loyal .
ass like your , i can see why he is worried you will punk .
what the hell are you doing ?
who s camille ?
none of your business .
some of us are trying to sleep .
you did not tell me you lived with her .
nothing happened between me and tia .
leave . now .
can i say something in my defense ?
move it .
how are ya doing , max .
you mean until you showed up ?
cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend ? who would take offense to that ?
do you know why i went after justine ?
she was there . . .
trying to have a relationship with you , max , is like standing in a fog bank . you know you are in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are .
and when the fog lifted , there s darren with his head under justine s skirt .
why would i be pissed ?
i was crazy about you . . . am crazy about you . but you keep everyone at arm s length like there s some great big dark something going on that i do not know . . . it is just that the more i tried to get close to you , the more you pulled away .
i am really glad we are having this conversation . you are right . i was angry at you . but talking about it the scales have fallen from my eyes and i see now that it was all my fault . can you ever forgive me ?
what are you doing here ?
i live here . . . guess i do not have to ask what you are doing here .
what is it ?
it is a sweep . c mon .
lemme put some clothes on .
out there .
no way .
but i am afraid of
nobody there to sign for it , mon . that is a bruddah s posed to do , ride around all day with the damn package ?
so you just decided to return it to the sender . or , in this case , the sender s wife .
which is none of your business . . . or mine .
it concerns only jah . but , in this case , i was the instrument of the most high .
what are you looking at me for ? i am not his next of kin . anyway , i do not got that kind of cash lying around .
where would you clip this ?
i did not . it was a present from a guy .
must think you are pretty special laying this on you .
thought so . turned out he wanted me for something else though .
same old story . not interested .
what are you looking for ?
a grand .
which means i gotta fence it for two . who s got that kinda scrilla lying around , these being the worst of the times .
i ai not mad at you . . .
i will give you seventy five bucks for it .
i should not do this . but i got a client looking to score some fire power . maybe you will keep your eyes open for me .
i do not get involved with guns .
i will make it worth your while .
you are light a deuce .
so max , what do you do with all your money ?
i made you coffee . that oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little .
thanks , it is starting to kick in . i feel almost human .
he is a mistake i made about six months before you did . but do not feel bad . justine made the same mistake , along with renee , jada , tia , brooke
what a creep .
that is with you ? every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he is family .
just thought maybe he would like a little coffee with his saliva .
you did not . . .
oh my god ! in here ! in here !
damn . . . are you alright ?
they took my daughter .
i know .
your daughter s the only leverage they have to keep you quiet .
can you help me get her back ?
if i give myself up in exchange for sophy , would you make sure she is okay ?
we are not going that route . sonrisa s not someone you make deals with .
what else can we do ?
look , we gotta keep the momentum up here , not give her a chance to think . if she hears her kid s voice . . .
hello . . .
goodnight bears . goodnight chairs . goodnight kittens . goodnight mittens . goodnight clocks . and goodnight socks . goodnight little house . and goodnight
i do not want to move away .
i know , honey , but just think how exiting it will be new house , new school , new friends
but why cannot we stay here ?
because we cannot . there s nothing here for us anymore .
are we in some kind of trouble ?
no . . .
what makes you cry ?
if i am sad , or tired , or sometimes when i am angry or when somebody s being mean to me .
pretty much the same reasons i was crying . but things will be better when we move to a new place .
sophy ? are you okay ?
mommy , where are you ?
do not worry , i am coming to get you .
when ?
soon , baby .
mommy , i am scared .
you are a thief ?
girl s gotta make a living .
thank god .
first time i ever heard that .
i was expecting someone else .
guess it was not the pizza delivery guy .
i am sorry if i caught you at a bad time .
you have good taste . french , s , attributed to chitarus .
whoever that is .
so , what , you liked it because it was shiny ?
no , because it is the egyptian goddess bast .
who is . . .
so this guy walks into a bar and says . . .
original cindy , say hi to my good friend
sorry about your window .
lemme get my coat .
how would you find me ?
was not that hard .
am i s posed to be flattered by all the attention ?
now you know who i am , where i live . i figured i better find out who i am dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me .
so now you tracked me down . what d ya think ?
too early to tell .
how does mrs . eyes only like being married to a guy on everybody s hit list ?
laurengs not my wife .
girlfriend ?
one of my sources . her husband was murdered by edgar sonrisa .
that is your shot in all this ? being a famous , anonymous , underground , pirate , cyber journalist cannot be much of a payday .
fortunately , my needs are met in that department .
so , what , you just like the sound of your own voice ?
look around at all this . . . built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life . then the bomb happened and everyone got scared . they blinked and before they knew it they would given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands . overnight the government , the police , everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them .
you miss the good ol days . even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they did not have to . and rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat . those good ol days ?
people had a choice , even if they took it for granted . and now they do not .
so what are you gonna do about it ?
something .
personally , i am more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the trans american building with my pals . instead of giving myself a headache over stuff i cannot do anything about .
you accept the way things are , you are an active participant in making it worse .
is the social studies class over for today ?
ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time ?
i will not be staying .
like following me around and pestering the people i work with was not bad enough , but breaking into my apartment
it was open .
you got a lotta nerve .
me ? you are the one who tried to rip off this piece .
completely different situation . i steal things in order to sell them . for money . it is called commerce . but some stranger sneaking into a girl s bedroom is . . . bent .
bent ?
bent .
you make it sound i pawed through your priceless collection of underwear .
how do i know you did not ?
so saw my hands off , i left you a present .
am i s posed to be grateful ?
that would be appropriate , yes .
how m i s posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo s probably touched everything i own ?
whoa there , tex ! we have been through all this .
it is alright , peter , we are fine .
look , if i made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out
yes on all counts .
i am sorry . it was not my intention . but i had to see you .
you would think a guy who s taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl .
i have not been able to get you off my mind .
you need to get out more .
gold leaf , art nouveau , french , early nineteen hundreds . . . i could probably fence this for three or four grand .
expensive gifts , surprise late night visits , over the top flattery . . . you always come on this strong ?
suppose i could help you locate the other ones .
the other ones ?
the other one like you . . .
you lost me .
l triptophane . . . a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures . then the lightbulb went off .
i do not know what kind of game you are playing here but i am out because you are a whack job .
he was working on something called project manticore , which was using recombinant dna to produce a superior human . . . a warrior . . . an advanced infantry soldier .
not that i do not enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me ?
we got separated right away . i never knew how many made it .
how well do you remember the lab ?
i remember fine . i just did not understand what was going on . they never told us anything except what to do . it took me a long time afterwards to figure things out .
how much do you know ?
i know they made me . even got the label on my neck to prove it .
the technical term for you is chimera . . .
yeah . . . a made up creature . like in mythology . . . with the head of a lion , the body of a goat and the tail of . . .
a girl .
your basic hodge podge .
christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives , just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people .
like extra virgin olive oil , the best of the best .
you said you could help .
i need to find this technician , or anyone else who knows about project manticore . they would have used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in vitro work . . . if i can track down one of them .
that is in it for you ?
your help .
i already do not like the sound of this .
the woman you met , lauren . she supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar . the real drug was shipped out of the country . the placebos were distributed to county va hospital and six veterans clinics in the area .
that is low , but this effects me how exactly ?
she is prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of edgar sonrisa s managers . you know who sonrisa is ?
yeah , i catch your hacks . he is satangs lap dog , or something .
so , you know the lengths he will go to keep her from going public . . . i am turning lauren over to canadian law enforcement tomorrow . they will put her in witness protection , but if you are with her the risk of her safety goes way down .
i did not make it this far by attracting a lot of attention .
she is put her life on the line , and her faith in me .
they have lost track of me and i plan to keep it that way .
you are a soldier , max . that is what you were put here for . but soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up .
see you are back and still rocking the boat .
i would have come sooner , but . . . i did not . . . how are you doing ?
not in any pain . . . the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord .
i am sorry .
my mother used to say the universe is right on schedule . everything happens like it is supposed to .
you believe that ?
i have never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen , i just know they do . so the job s to figure out how to deal with the consequences . which you did . . . you took that sonuvabitch out .
well , not me personally .
on accounta you , sonrisa did not get to buy off the jury , or kill the judge . he is gone . once and for all . it was war , max , and you won .
that is this ?
it turned up on the black market . one of my sources thought i might be interested .
i do not know what to say .
forty seven people drowned last night off the coast of vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into canada so they could get work in order to eat . only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead .
these girls , kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder . the oldest is twelve . the youngest about the same age you were when you escaped .
and i feel real bad about all that but it does not mean i need to get involved .
you are involved . by being alive you are involved .
we are quoting mom again .
maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe , sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation . but the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden . was not s posed to , but it did . and it is back to the law of the jungle . you got your predators and you got your victims .
and you still think you can do something to change that .
with your help .
civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes . but logan and max , with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening .
that was taken nine years ago . . . i . d . would as michael hanover . sentenced to months in the state penn at rawlins , wyoming for armed robbery . he escaped from custody after days . has not been seen or heard from since .
i am looking for a lady who works here .
know where i can find her ?
you do not want to .
but she does work here ?
she may be easy on the eyes but she is trouble , trust me . hot run to two oh two sansomme .
i need to talk to her .
max something . i got no clue where she stays .
any idea when she will be back ?
none .
who is it ?
a friend of your fiance s .
what do you want ?
who are you ?
my name s lydia . and it seems you and i have a lot in common .
you said you knew where my fiance was the other night .
with me , where he is been after work , three , sometimes four nights a week for the last two months . . . we have what you might call an intimate relationship .
how do i know you are telling the truth ?
he been sleeping in a t shirt lately ? that is so you will not see the fingernail marks on his back . bet you did not know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting . he did not either . . . at first .
look , i do not know what you want
i thought it was important for you to know the facts .
and so should you . sketchy told me i could expect a visit from you . i know all about how you threatened him . that if he did not break it off with me , you would save him the trouble .
oh ?
well , it is over between you and him . we are getting married next month .
how sweet . standing by your man , even after what he did . you are a very understanding person .
big part of loving someone s being able to forgive them .
you are also a fool .
i think you should go now .
this is not a place you wanna go .
help . . . lemme go . . . no , do not let me go . . . help . . .
now , here s how it is gonna be , lydia . you are gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails , and you are gonna go home and figure out your marriage , instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do , understand ?
say the words , i understand .
i understand .
i asked you to keep that thing outside .
you did .
you drive away business roaring in like that .
yeah , does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got going on here .
you got a punk ass mouth on you , kid .
my name s not kid . it is client . as in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle . now , you got something for me or not ?
i got a hit on the car . an oh five tahoe , blue , with wyoming tags . . . agt . . . it was not easy cause you were off in one of the numbers .
who s this guy ? this is not who we are looking for . . . her name was hannah .
he got the car in a trade for his old pick up and some food . . . no bill of sale or nothing . it was right after the pulse so all the dmv records were wiped . so we do not get anything on the seller . except i actually managed to find this guy , six hours on the phone . . . say thank you .
thank you .
guy says he made the trade in gillette , wyoming sometime in the fall of oh nine .
then what ?
then what ? that is it . that is all i got .
nothing on hannah ?
she was a nurse . she must have lived near there , somewhere , near the . . . . . . the clinic . there must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for wyoming .
what about the other kids ? you get anything on them ?
they do not exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar codes on their necks , which is something i am not even going to ask about
you were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks .
nothing so far from arrests , hospital admissions or coroners . this kind of search . . . it is heavy spadework . i am gonna need
as long as you are okay .
i do not know what your story is and i do not want to .
whoever tossed this place wants you . and i am looking to stay outta the line of fire .
how is this about me ?
they lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery . but there s a bug in my computer keyboard , a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture .
like you said , maybe somebody s tracking one of your investigations .
hardware s too sophisticated . it is gotta be the government . and why do i think they are looking for you ?
you are crazy .
your fiance has four previous wives . his m . o . is to clean em out and take off . which is what you oughta do .
i am sorry i could not come up with something more positive .
i need a favor . . . i need you to trace a number for me .
sure you wanna be having this conversation over the phone ?
zero . . . c mon , dan i do not have all day .
got a pencil ?
just give it to me . i will remember .
one seven four nine five natoma .
morning , sunshine . . .
caught some son of a bitch stealing my bike . used a car jack to blow out my u lock and bent a bunch of spokes . so now i gotta get my wheels fixed .
at least he did not swing with your ride .
now , why cannot i find a girlfriend like that ? brings him lunch everyday , thoughtful , sweet , legs from here to there
straight .
craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him .
what guys do . nother order .
you are way more philosophical than i could ever be .
that is odd . . .
tell me the truth . am i a female fog bank ?
you are not seriously buying into darrengs nonsense .
no .
he was just trying to blame you cause he is a slut .
yeah .
hell yeah . there s not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying . you are a totally down ass female and a straight up friend who happens to be a little . . .
a little what ?
you know what i am saying .
if i knew what you were saying , i would not be asking .
how long you and me known each other ?
a long time .
long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book , right ?
because you are probably my closest friend in the whole world .
and back at ya . only there s a part of you that is . . . i do not know
a fog bank .
gotta go .
where ?
you are actually gonna bail sketchy out .
yeah , cause maybe he is learned his lesson .
unlikely .
and because he is my friend .
friends do not help other friends cheat .
and because i actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes .
please . . .
they are prisoners to their genes .
so are dogs .
they do not have a lot of moving parts .
only one i can think of .
besides , think of the drama i am sparing natalie .
i say hang the bastard out to dry , let her see him for the heel he is , then maybe she will step to the all girl team and let mama licious ease her pain .
yeah , i can see to it your winning streak continues .
not right now .
not right now ? okay , when ?
right after you change your wardrobe , your personality and drop about thirty pounds .
quite a mouth on a girl so young . . . . . . but my guess is talking is not what it does best .
only way you are ever gonna find out is reincarnation . . . fact is , you are gonna pay me , and i am gonna provide you with a service .
i actually know how this works .
who are you ?
look , you are a player . . . i am bringing you this on a plate , and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business .
so , how do you get the woman to come to me ?
i told her it is just business to you , that all you want is a reasonable solution to this . you give her daughter back , she agrees to leave the country . i play the guarantor , drive her down to mexico tonight , and put her on a train to brazil or wherever .
and she bought that ?
make the call .
she is gonna need to know that her little girl s alright .
she is got my word .
can you put that in a bag or something ?
you get it when i get her .
it is payday , need me to pick up your check ?
playing hooky again ?
feel like the dog s dinner .
probably a touch of that is going around .
do not believe everything you hear on tv .
what if he is on the level ?
here s the dealio on eyes only . he is probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick ass apartment , bored stupid . so he gets off on scaring the poop outta folks like you i gotta go .
tell everybody hey .
catch you back at the wall .
quitting time . grab a cold one ?
i gotta meet natalie for dinner .
right , the big one oh .
hey , sketchy
we gotta talk .
you blew off your girlfriend last night , even though it was the big one oh . i would be pissed off too if i was her .
i do not see how you cheating on natalie involves me .
i know what you are thinking . but the truth is , this other person is not someone i am in love with . as a matter of fact , after what she just did , she is not even someone i like much . so in a technical sense , i am not sure you could call me and her cheating . . . officially .
do guys actually believe their lame , self serving excuses ?
max
or do you think we are just so grateful to have one of you idiots we will look the other way , which is arrogant and condescending .
lame , self serving , arrogant . . . guilty as charged .
you left out condescending .
but there s another side
here it comes . the part where the guy turns everything around .
i am the victim here .
really ?
hear me out . this person i have been seeing is a jam pony client who happens to be married
and you were a sympathetic ear .
exactly .
then a sympathetic mouth , then a sympathetic
she had me followed the other day and found out about natalie . now , this persongs demanding i blow her off or she will do it for me by telling nat about us .
does this person have a name ?
lydia .
and lydia telling natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way ?
i am a toy to her .
a toy ?
she is as much as said so . but she does not want to share her toy with anyone else . . . it is just an ego thing with her .
fight fire with fire . threaten to go to her husband .
who either does not care , or could have me killed . either way , natalie s still gonna find out .
what happens if you level with her ?
even if she does not dump me , which is unlikely , she would never be able to trust me again .
and why should she ?
so you are straight on how this is gonna go down .
you set up on lydia . when she is on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up . i answer the door and pretend to be natalie .
she tells you how i have been
a philandering pig .
but you explain that you are a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me .
or , i dissolve into an angry , hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again , which is probably what would really happen .
i just do not want natalie to ever find out . she deserves better .
how would you get her out of town ?
convinced her she needed to visit her mom in san mateo .
and we are sure lydia s gonna make her move ?
she came by the apartment once already . fortunately , i would disconnected the doorbell as a precaution . . . lydia s not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh .
i will give it my best shot .
max , what did i do to deserve a friend like you ?
you rock , max . you . . . rock . . .
easy sketchy .
no , i am serious . that psycho got exactly what she deserved . . . yes .
lydia may not have been one of humanity s finer specimens but
she is toxic . . . monster in bed , but toxic .
you would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she is the villain in the piece . . . you are .
she was the one
none of this would have happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self restraint , which you did not .
true , but
you were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish . and if i ever find out you are going out the back door on natalie again , you are the one who s gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up . understand ?
okay , okay , okay
that was extreme ! did you see that one guy
this is a hot run . beat it . you are late .
i was on call .
i want you on call here .
that is the difference if i am on call here or deployed in the field .
more like deployed in bed asleep .
i do not sleep . . . theo asked me to pick up his check .
and theo cannot pick up his own check because ? . . .
he is sick .
for a change .
you tell theo he is not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job .
fourteen thirteen market . get a signature , then take it to this address . . . by the way , that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already .
what about this ?
hot run to beulah , corner of haight . . . and you can tell your pal theo he just got his worthless ass fired . not that he cares but the wife and kid might .
thanks , miss .
you are too kind . i am amanda .
right , well , thanks for the drinks and stuff , amanda , but there s no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore .
do not be so glum , hawk . the night s still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities .
huh ?
what the hell is that ?
gin .
whoa . some of this hard liquor s a tad too manly for me . i am a brewski man myself .
better ease up then , hawk . would not want to give you whiskey dick would we ?
well . obviously no one you have to worry about . . . woody .
well , amanda , this has been quite a night . so far you have seen me and my dick throw up . that is next ? projectile diarrhea ? man . what a stud , huh ?
you love him ?
i just told you , he is a big , hairy . . .
no , i mean . . . you love your son ?
more than anything in the world .
and he loves you back , does not he ?
he is a little spoiled , but i know he does .
amanda , as ironic as this is gonna sound , i cannot take any money for . . . i am no midnight cowboy , y know . it would only cheapen the whole deal for me .
you are a little scrawny , but thanks to the concert we are low on amateurs . name ?
hawk .
pick a song , hawk .
got any kiss ?
you kidding ? this is detroit . drink ?
that is that ?
sure , i have . but not one with ice in it , that is all .
whoa . . . she is a killer .
oh , dicky , i c c cannot . . .
you are not gonna chicken out on me now , are you ? we have got your kiss song playing and everything .
i i c cannot . . .
no problem .
sorry .
jeremiah ?
beth ? i cannot believe it .
i did not mean for that to be so . . . intense . forgive me .
i have loved you ever since i first laid eyes on you , jeremiah . i have just always been too scared to show it .
beth , i cannot believe you just said that because that is exactly how i have always felt about you . . . call me jam . it is my band name .
we have got to take this slow . . .
right , slow . . .
so . is it true that gene simmons had a cow s tongue grafted onto his real one ? y know , to make it so long ?
i dunno . i think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther . i am not too up on gene trivia .
your man is the drummer , peter criss , right ?
peter criss is my inspiration , man . if i paid a hundred bucks for a kiss show and all i saw was his solo , i would consider it . . . money . . . hey , how would you know that ?
ann arbor ?
ann arbor is not . . . that far from cleveland , right ?
nah . once i get my own wheels , i could come up all the time .
i feel like such an idiot . why did not i just say something a year and a half ago ? man , think of how much time we wasted .
let s not think about the past . let s just think about from today on . i will never forget you , jam .
coming dad . i will call you . soon as we get a phone . bye .
oh , great . i just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads . . . i am hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown detroit called disco inferno . mind dropping me there ?
that is it worth to you ?
so , are you , like , gonna polish our nobs , or what ?
tease ? what the hell did i do to tease you mongoloids ?
you got in the car , did not you ?
oh , god , how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere .
what are you , high ?
yeah .
wonder if you could smoke shit out of this ?
this is the best thing that ever happened to me at school ! not only are we on again for kiss in detroit , but we are actually sitting right at the fifty yard line ! i dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario .
namely ?
well , the least we , his only buds in the world , can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence .
just for the record , i understood the last part of what you said , but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever .
i am starving and it is way past lunchtime .
let s stop in sandusky , hawk .
that is in sandusky ?
you call that john travolta denny terio shit dancing ? i would not dance like that in private if you paid me .
what was that d . j . s name again ?
i have one question . how could a kid who wails on the drums like it is the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say ?
so maybe we got enough for one ticket . fuck !
waitaminit , dudes ! i got it ! we find four really small kids , beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets . what do you think ?
. . . at twenty thirty hours .
one more time in english .
any luck ?
will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead .
shit , that dork is jam .
yeah , she gives you shit and you take it .
second floor girls john ! two minutes ! he will never look there !
that is sherry vanhafton .
whoa . . . she just farted .
i have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life .
too bad we are stuck in electronics or . . .
but . . . but , st . bernard s is way the hell over in the next county !
so ? your mom s car has a cb , radar detector and cruise control , check ?
we are not stealing my mom s car .
damn straight we are .
hawk , all i need is one ding on the volvo and presto ! there are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from cincinnati .
and when is she due back from that groinecologist s convention anyway ?
sunday , but . . .
there s only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just does not matter anymore , lex . you familiar with a condition known as absolute zero ?
the hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity ? yeah , i am vaguely familiar
very funny , hawk . okay , i am in on this hare brained scheme , but if anything happens to my mom s car , i am blaming you . i will say you drugged me or something .
ok , dudes , follow my lead .
now , how are we gonna do this ?
we got you a change of duds when we picked up the car .
jeezis , hawk , can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit ?
what the fuck !
uh . . . dudes ?
now there s a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood .
here s a suggestion . let s stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this volvo situation .
now listen up . here s the game plan .
. . . i mean , my mom s got insurance . that is the worst thing she could do ? ground me for the entire year ? i can handle that . . .
cool , bro , now listen up . . .
. . . holy shit ! i am in absolute trouble ! i never should have let you drive , man ! absolute fucking trouble !
i think we should try sneaking in .
four dudes sneaking in ? we would get busted fer sure . bad plan .
okay , one of us sneaks in , gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience , comes back out , and we all re enter the concerto . voila !
i found the volvo .
no . . . you do not think . . . ?
do you realize the sheer , goddamn , unadulterated , undiluted , no holds barred , one hundred percent pure as ivory snow , absolutely frigging stupidity of what you just did ?
could be .
are you getting wise with me ?
well , let s recap , shall we ? you slapped all of us , yelled at me , used my head for a rag , threw me on the ground and tossed our love gun track under the wheels of a passing semi . so , if the lesson was that you are a dick with ears and a really bad haircut , then , yes . . . i would say we learned it .
excuse me , i am a little deef a hearing . can you repeat yourself ?
okay . ahem ! you . are . a . dick . with . ears . and . a . really . bad . haircut .
how would you like a nice hawaiian punch ?
dude , this is all i got .
sorry , man , no can do . but i will be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy .
where the hell am i gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour ?
you look a little scrawny , but it is worth a shot .
i cannot just walk in and take my clothes off . it is embarrasskin .
dude , if it were dancing the way fred astaire did it , i would give it my best shot . i would learn the steps and practice in my spare time . but this . . . tribal , ritualistic bullshit , it is way too spontaneous for me .
yeah , you are probably too young anyhow .
hey , i invented fake i . d . s , alright . that is not the problem . . . they are playing disco music in there , man .
jam , listen up .
hawk ?
are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones ? sounds like you are taking a dump the size of butte , montana .
it is my bullworker .
anyway , listen up . they are gone !
that is gone ?
the kiss tickets , you nimrod ! they are just fucking gone ! please tell me you have m !
gone ! ? why would i have the kiss tick . . . ?
cool .
i am really sorry about that , man .
do not be a fembot . so , are you like grounded because of last night , or what ?
they are still at my house in trip s jacket .
they are what ?
do not worry about it . they are perfectly safe . we can pick them up after school . my mom will not be home . it is no problem .
all right . after school we double time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the to detroit rock city .
if he offers you a slice , you are not the least bit hungry , check ?
do not you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off ?
oh no , jam . i am not falling for that twice .
it does not mean anything . do not pay attention to him .
hey , look at the front entrance ! a car s pulling out . the parking space from heaven . god is surely smiling down upon us tonight , dudes .
oh , i am sorry , trip . what you made was a big , brainless , pile of horse shit . no offense .
guys , guys ! come on , if this is anyone s fault , it is mine . i was the one who grabbed trip s jacket by mistake . it is my fault and i apologize .
it was stolen !
i am sorry , guys . i thought it was a nice thing to do .
i got . . .
wait ! i know how we can get in !
jam , shut up ! you are not allowed to speak , remember ? go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four . i do not wanna hear it .
but . . . my plan involves all four of us acting together .
well . . . i still got my idea if anybody will let me speak .
go ahead , jam .
oh , hi , mom .
jeremiah , what are you doing ?
ahh , sunshine .
you are going to be late if you do not hurry up and change soon .
change ? that is wrong with what i got on ?
it is dirty laundry for one thing and for another , you still have not worn the clothes i bought you . you are skating on thin ice already , young man , so i would not push my luck . now get out of those rags .
but , mom !
they are not idiots .
now do not forget you are on the honor system tonight . i will be home a little after one and if you have been partying or playing that satanic kiss music . . . well , need i remind you of the consequences ?
grounded for the rest of the year ?
i made an appointment with father phillip mcnulty at st . bernard s . we are to see him directly where he will register you on the spot .
you mean , you are sending me to . . . b b boarding school ?
someday you will have a son just like you , jeremiah . a boy who lies through his teeth , buys demonic records , and smokes the dope just like you .
if i am anything like you , i will deserve him .
what ? !
i said , i am sorry !
mom , what are we . . . ?
jeremiah . . . that is gotten into you ?
forgive me , father , for i have sinned . this is my first confession in . . . well . . . a really long time .
prepare to receive the act of penance . how many sins have you committed since your last confession ?
so , you see if it was not for me , me and my friends would be at that kiss concert right now . . . together .
that is it ?
yeah .
well , this is a unique confession to say the least , son . and not exactly the most interesting one i have ever heard either . you sure you do not want to talk about . . . oh , carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe . . . or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad s bed ?
no .
okay , you better have something really sinful for me this time , son . my patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute .
alright , father , here it is . about two weeks ago i went to my cousings wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if i wanted to take a bath .
i was insulted , so i asked her if i was wreaking some wicked b . o . , right ? then she said no , she wanted to take a bath with me .
oh , this is terrible . . . please go on .
well ? continue ! continue !
okay . . . when she peeled off that gown , you will never guess what she was wearing underneath .
no . much bet . . . i mean , much more sinful than that .
a bustier ?
tell you what . you keep guessing and i will say something when you get it .
jam has yet to do an overnight with us .
poor , jam , man . imagine having to stash your kiss records inside carly simon album covers . no question , mrs . bruce is a psycho bitch from hell .
trip , a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make . and even if it did , at least my mom did not give birth to me while she was on lsd .
trip , you fucking asshole .
yeah , right . she wishes . look at that big ass .
that is some sick shit right there . did she comb your ass hair for you too ?
i knew it ! i knew this was gonna happen ! i had a bad feeling since last night . remember ? we are so totally fucked !
hey , take it easy , man . this is the girls crapper , remember ?
wake up , lex ! we just watched jam s mom torch our fucking kiss tickets ! not reo speedwagon ! not journey ! not the bay city rollers ! kiss ! if you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom , i would sure like to hear it !
oh , everything s hunky dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would , you snug sonofabitch ! you fucking jinxed us !
i did it ! i did it ! we won !
the chinese have a proverb that which appears too good to be true , usually is . there s gotta be a catch .
simplicity , hawk .
about fucking time if you ask me . i am just going through the motions till i drop out anyway .
well , here we are back at fucking school again .
eyowch ! this is one hot pizza !
man , that weed knocked christine on her ass . she is sleeping like a baby stella .
really , trip , can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change ?
it is gone .
but we took the keys ?
damn , she musta hot wired it . we picked up a professional car thief in the shape of olivia newton john !
twenty five more n i got .
please sir , do not beat me up . i do have a kiss ticket , but not on me .
a likely story . hand it over , kid .
hey , kid , that is okay . i do not wanna see kiss that ba . . .
do not try to run , maggot . chongo s an all state track star in every event .
what do you want ?
a tag on your toe . nobody threatens me and lives .
look , you can have my wallet . . .
please , sir , do not kick my ass ! i will do anything to get out of a beating !
two hundred bucks ?
you heard me , nad breath . my time s precious and i think that is a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life .
oh , yeah ! you and what army ?
gimme your gun , boy !
no , you gimme your gun , boy !
do not tempt me , i will shoot !
not if i shoot first !
i do not even think you have a gun !
simple simon on the rock , go caller .
hello ? is this me ? i am trip . am i on the air ?
i should hang up on you right now , but you are the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk . what are the names of the four members of kiss ?
is that your final answer ?
yeah .
i did ?
yeah , you did !
yeeeehaaawww ! ! this is totally fucking curly , man ! thank you god !
good morning , mongrels !
good morning . . .
that is all the gusta you can musta ? i said , good morning !
good morning !
now that is better . . . but i still sense some students out there . . . who are afraid . . . just to say good morning !
good morning !
are you afraid ?
good morning !
hi . . . that is going on here ?
horrible accident . my neighbour . . . he got killed .
what happened ?
what was his name ?
i feel bad for his family .
yeah .
dr . monnitoff ?
donnie .
so . . . according to hawking . . . wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space time .
so . . . in order to travel back in time , you would have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light
theoretically .
and be able to find one of these wormholes .
a wormhole with an einstein rosen bridge , which is , theoretically . . . a wormhole in space controlled by man .
so . . . that is it ?
like a delorean .
what effect do you think this would have on an infant ?
well . . . the thing is , nobody remembers their infancy . and anyone who says they do is lying . we think that this would help develop memory earlier in life .
each vessel travels along a vector path through space time . . . along its centre of gravity .
like a spear .
beg pardon ?
like a spear that comes out of your stomach ?
uhh . . . sure . and in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal , in this case the wormhole , or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered .
could these wormholes appear in nature ?
that . . . is highly unlikely . you are talking about an act of god .
if god controls time . . . then all time is pre decided . then every living thing travels along a set path .
i am not following you .
if you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach , you could see into the future . and that is a form of time travel , right ?
you are contradicting yourself , donnie . if we could see our destines manifest themselves visually . . . then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies . the very fact that this choice exists . . . would mean that all pre formed destiny would end .
not if you chose to stay within god s channel . . .
when can i squeeze one out ?
why do i have to sleep with donnie ? he stinks .
when you fall asleep tonight , i am gonna fart in your face .
what happens if you tell mom and dad about this , samantha ?
the last unicorn ! by samantha darko .
did you tell them that i flooded the school ?
i did not say shit .
that is not what i heard . now they think i did it .
well , if you are innocent , then you have nothing to worry about .
dea ex machina . . .
what did you say ?
how can you do that ?
why did you make me flood the school ?
we just want to guide you in the right direction .
who is . . . we ?
you will know soon enough .
where did you come from ?
i want to show you something .
you have to do something for me first .
you have a request ?
yeah . tell me why you are wearing that stupid bunny suit .
why are you wearing that stupid man suit ?
what happened to your eye ?
i am so sorry .
why do they call you frank ?
it is the name of my father . . . and his father before me .
how much longer is this gonna last ?
darko cheats death ! man . . . you are famous ! i called you , like , a jillion times last night !
we went to a hotel .
my dad said he found you on the golf course . are you sleepwalking again ?
how old is grandma death ?
what would you do , donnie ? what would you do !
hey . . .
hey . . .
wanna walk me home ?
do not look so freaked .
i am not . but you should check your backpack cause those guys like to steal shit .
so . . . you just moved here ?
yeah . my parents got divorced . my mom has a restraining order against my stepdad . he has . . . emotional problems .
oh , i . . . have those too . what kind of problems does your dad have ?
wow . did he go to jail ?
he fled . they still cannot find him . my mom and i had to change our names and stuff . i thought gretchen sounded kind of cool .
i am sorry . i was in jail once . i accidentally burned down this house . it was abandoned . i got held back in school again . cannot drive until i am eighteen . i think when i grow up i want to be a painter . or maybe a writer or maybe both . then i will write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book . you know , change things .
donnie darko is a cool name . sounds like a superhero .
i should go . for physics . monnitoff says i have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind .
i mean , the whole sanitation thing . joseph lister . . . . before antiseptics there was no sanitation , especially in medicine .
you mean soap ?
do not knock soap . without it , disease would spread rapidly . if we ran out . . . you and i would never live to see the year .
wonder where we will be then .
the best thing about soap is that it is the only thing on earth that can never get dirty . no matter what crap you throw on it . . . it always rubs off . and there it is again . . . perfect .
it is a good thing the school was flooded today .
why is that ?
you are weird .
i am sorry .
that was a compliment .
will you go with me ?
where are we going ?
no . . . i mean , will you go with me ? that is like . . . what they call it here . going together .
where are you going ?
so when you sleepwalk , can you remember afterward ? like , do you dream ?
no . i just wake up and i look around , try to figure out where i am . . . how i got there .
it is like this big force . . . that is in your brain . but sometimes it grows bigger . . . and it spread down into your arms and legs . . . and it just sends you someplace .
so when you sleepwalk , you go somewhere familiar ?
no . every time i wake up somewhere different . sometimes my bike is laying there next to me . like once when i woke up on the edge of this cliff up on carpathian ridge .
donnie ?
yeah ?
do you ever feel as though there s always someone watching you ?
why ?
what happened to your neck ?
babies cry because they are afraid of the dark . and because they have no memories . . . for all they know . . . every night could be the last forever . like , perpetual darkness .
why not just buy your baby a night light ?
that is not good enough . you have got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them . . . with whatever you wanted .
with , like , images ?
you know . . . we have been going together for a week and a half . . .
and what ?
well . . .
that is alright . . . i understand .
no . . . donnie , wait . i have never . . .
i always wanted it to be at a time when . . . when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be .
we are moving through time .
they suspended me for two days .
are you okay ?
i have been seeing stuff . . . a lot of really messed up stuff . do you know who grandma death is ?
who ?
oh , yeah . the philosophy of time travel . what is this ?
i know she is here . she never leaves the house .
so , we call them . . . imgs .
infant memory generators .
yeah . so the idea is that . . . you buy these glasses for your infant , and they wear them at night when they sleep .
what ? how long was i asleep ?
you want to skip fourth period and go to the ridge ?
that is wrong with you ?
will you please talk to me ?
not now , donnie . it is not a good time .
hey .
hey . you ok ?
my mom is gone .
where is she ?
i do not know . she did not leave a note . the house is all messed up .
did you call the cops ?
i am so scared . . . i just keep thinking that something awful has happened . it is my fucking stepdad . i know it .
what ?
come with me .
time is running out . we have to go see grandma death . we have to talk to her .
why ? is this about the book ?
no . frank .
is that a cellar door ?
i am sorry , ms . farmer , i just do not get this .
just place an x in the appropriate place on the lifeline .
i just do not get this . everything cannot be lumped into two categories . that is too simple .
the lifeline is divided that way .
well , life is not that simple . so what if ling ling kept the cash and returned the wallet ? that has nothing to do with either fear or love .
fear and love are the deepest of human emotions .
people are not that simple .
will you still be working at yarn barn ? cause that is a great place to raise children .
you are such a fuck ass .
oh , please tell me , elizabeth , how exactly does one suck a fuck ?
i wish i knew where you went at night . did you toilet paper the johnsongs house ?
i stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade , mom . get out of my room .
you know . . . it would be nice to look at you some time . . . and see my son . i do not recognise this person today .
grandma death .
he cannot , samantha . he is been suspended from after school activities . donnie . . . are you still with us ? how was your therapy session tonight ?
i have to take the girls to los angeles tomorrow .
do you get to meet ed ?
if i am lucky . so . . . i will not be back until the first . your dad will be back on sunday , so i have put elizabeth in charge until then . she has the car . . . so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow .
how does it feel to have a wacko for a son ?
so how was school today ?
it was great . we had peanut butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime . and then during show and tell , my stuffed walrus was a big hit .
good lord . so the construction guys say it will take about a week to fix the roof . damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match .
do they know yet ?
know what ?
where it came from ?
no . . . apparently they cannot tell us what happened yet . something about a matching serial number that got burned . but i had to sign a form saying i would not talk to anyone about it .
so we are not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows ?
oh , shit !
grandma death .
you are right . roberta sparrow was famous for her gem collections . kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time . over the years . . . as she got older , she became more and more of a recluse . . . now she just likes to stay up there all by herself .
who s been giving you weird looks ?
you are my only son . . .
i know , dad .
donnie darko , perhaps , given your recent brush with mass destruction , you can give us your opinion ?
who is frank ?
and when the other rabbits hear of fiver s vision , do they believe him ? it could be the death of an entire way of life , the end of an era .
why should we care ?
because the rabbits are us , donnie .
why should i mourn for a rabbit like it was a human ?
is the death of one species less tragic than another ?
ms . pomeroy . . . that is going on ?
donnie . . . it is friday . should not you be off with your friends , scaring old people ?
where are you going ?
i do not know . that is a good question . . . but suffice to say that i am no longer your english teacher . they fired me .
that is bullshit . you are a good teacher .
thank you , donnie . and you are a good student . lazy . . . but a good student . unlike most of the others , you question mom and dad s rules .
what do i tell the rest of the class when they ask about you ?
that is cellar door ?
cellar door .
so . . . will donnie find his cellar door ?
i think i already have . but now she will not even talk to me .
your mother said that you have been skipping cycles of your medication .
i have been taking it . i just like to make her feel guilty for all of this . you know , abuse her . psychologically .
so , i met a new friend .
would you like to talk about this friend ?
his name is frank .
frank .
i think he saved my life .
how so ?
do not you watch the news ?
i do not own a television .
frank . . . instructed you . . . to get out of bed . . . just before this happened .
he said to follow him .
follow him where ?
do you believe that the world is coming to an end ?
and when i clap my hands twice , you will wake up . do you understand ?
yes .
so , tell me about your day , donald .
i met a girl .
what is her name ?
gretchen . we are going together now .
do you think a lot about girls ?
yes .
how are things going at school ?
i think about girls a lot .
i asked you about school .
i think about . . . fucking a lot during school .
what else do you think about during school ?
i think . . . about . . . who s the boss ?
who is the boss ?
i just turn the volume down and think about fucking alyssa milano .
what about your family , donnie ?
no , i do not think about fucking my family . that is sick !
how many times have you seen frank ?
four times . . . so far .
can anyone else see him ?
i do not think so . it is like a tv station . and they are tuned into mine and no one else s .
who is they ? is frank part of some larger group ?
i do not know . gretchen has a theory . that frank is a sign . i told her i thought it was ridiculous .
a sign from whom ?
i think that frank wants me to go to this woman . she wrote a book about time travel . frank asked me if i believed in time travel . that cannot just be a random coincidence . my dad almost hit her with the car the other day , and she said the creepiest thing . she said that every living creature on this earth dies alone .
how does that make you feel ?
it reminded me of my dog callie .
is callie still around ?
no . she died when i was eight . we could not find her for days . she went and crawled underneath our back porch . . .
i would like to believe that i am not . . . but i have just never seen any proof . so i just choose not to bother with it . it is , like , i could spend my whole life thinking about it . . . debating it in my head . weighing the pros and cons . and in the end , i still would not have any proof . so . . . i do not even debate it any more . because it is absurd . i do not want to be alone . so , does that make me , like , an atheist ?
and they grow out of our stomachs ?
it was just like she described them in her book . like they were alive . the way that they looked . . . moved . . . smelled . they were like workers . . . assigned to each one of us . i followed my spear . . . and i found something . . .
nothing .
have you told gretchen about the spears ?
yeah , but if i told her about the other stuff about frank . . .
are you embarrassed by these things that you see ?
whoa . that is ok , dr . thurman , it is nothing to be embarrassed about . i have sexual fantasies all the time too .
i know .
i mean . . . gretchen . . . she will not even let me kiss her . she says because it is our first kiss . . . she is , like , waiting for this big . . . moment or something . i just do not get it . i just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff .
the good stuff .
yeah . . . you know . . . fucking .
and when i clap my hands together twice , you will wake up . do you understand ?
yes .
so , your parents . . . why did you disappoint them ?
i . . . i was playing with fire .
people get hurt .
but it was an accident . the house was under construction .
people get hurt . i do not want to hurt anyone .
but you were punished .
yes . i went to jail .
do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead ?
they . . . did not buy me what i wanted for christmas that year .
what did you want for christmas that year ?
hungry hungry hippos .
how did you feel . . . being denied those hungry hungry hippos ?
regret .
what else makes you feel regret ?
that i did it again .
you have done it again ?
yes . i flooded my school . . . and i burned down that pervert s house . i think i only have a few days left . . . before they catch me .
i have to obey him . . . because he saved my life . he controls me and i have to obey him or i will be left all alone . . . and i will never figure out what all of this means . . .
if god exists ?
i think now that he might . . .
why ?
because i am so horny .
god exists because you are horny .
i think so . i think that is one of the clues . it is a clue that tells us . . . to keep going .
where are we going , donald ?
i have the power to build a time machine .
how is that possible ?
grandma death will teach me how . soon .
then how is time travel possible ?
it would have to be god s portal . they will lead me to it . then i will go back in time . . . and i will not feel regret anymore .
when will this happen ?
what is going to happen ?
frank is going to kill .
i can see him right now !
where is he , donald ?
he is right there . . . he can read my mind and he will show me the way out of this . the sky is going to open up . . . and then he will reveal himself to me .
if the sky were to suddenly open up . . . there would be no law . . . there would be no rule . there would only be you and your memories . . . the choices you have made and the people you have touched . the life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged . . . by which you must judge yourself . because when this world ends , there will only be you and him . . . and no one else .
it is too late . i have already ruined my life .
your medication . they are placebos . just pills made out of water .
thank you .
donald , an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a god . you are an agnostic . an agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of god . . . but does not deny the possibility that god exists .
goodbye , dr . thurman .
whoa , elizabeth . a little hostile , there . maybe you should be the one in therapy . then mom and dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts . . . so we will not have to .
it is called the philosophy of time travel .
what does time travel have to do with philosophy ?
so i hear you have a girlfriend .
yeah .
that is her name ?
you are not gonna tell mom , are you ?
why would i tell mom ?
because you tell mom everything .
no i do not . she worries about you .
well , do not worry . . . i am taking my medication .
it is not that . i mean mouthing off to your teachers . i will admit . . . when dad told me what you said to ms . farmer , i laughed my ass off .
i was just being honest .
yeah . . . well , that is not the way the world works . if you keep being too honest , the world will eventually find a way to destroy you .
her name is gretchen .
i got in . i am going to harvard .
mom and dad will not be back until sunday night . it is halloween carnival . we should throw a party . we could totally get away with it .
okay , but it has to be a small one .
how much are they paying you to be here ?
excuse me ? that is your name , son ?
gerald .
well , gerald , i think you are afraid .
i think you are afraid to ask me for advice . i think that you are a very troubled . . . confused young man . i think you are searching for answers in all the wrong places .
thank you for seeing us . . . we . . . just felt that it was time to discuss . . .
what i think is going on with your son .
has your son ever told you about frank ?
come again ?
frank . . . the giant bunny rabbit ?
frank ?
donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination .
you are telling me my son has an imaginary friend ?
i . . . what can we do ?
if that is what you think is necessary .
our son just called me a bitch .
so let me get this straight . no airline will claim ownership of the engine . so we have to wait for the faa to decide who fixes my roof . fuck that . we are taking the money out of savings .
what ?
frankie feedler . you remember him from high school ?
he was a year ahead of us ?
i have not been accepted yet , mother .
excuse me ?
did you just call me a fuck ass ?
that is enough .
no . i took a year off to be with you . of course i care . do not get angry . what ?
how did you know
i did not realise it was such a big deal .
it is a big deal .
here are the keys to the taurus . there s plenty of groceries in the fridge . and i left money on the kitchen table . and do not forget . . .
i got twelve classrooms full of water . all coming from a busted water main .
what else ?
christ . is that an axe ?
yep .
how did this happen ?
excuse me . . . but what is the real issue here ? the pta does not ban books from school .
do you even know who graham greene is ?
kitty , i do not know what to say . they have suspended him for two days . ever since this jet fiasco , i honestly do not know what has gotten into him .
rose .
kitty . . .
rose , we have a crisis . i am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against jim cunningham .
yes , i saw the news . something about a kiddie porn dungeon .
please ! do not say those words . well . . . as you can see . . . many of us are devastated by this news . this is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man . and i have taken it upon myself to spearhead the jim cunningham defence campaign . but unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest . . . which involves you .
beg pardon ?
rose . . . i have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning . and as you know , the girls also leave for los angeles tomorrow morning . now , as their coach . . . i was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip .
but now you cannot go .
yes . and believe me , of all the other mothers i would never dream of asking you , given the predicament with your son . but none of the other mothers are able to go .
oh , kitty , i do not know . this is so last minute . . . eddie is in new york . . .
kitty , i would appreciate . . . if you could wait . . .
mr . cole . . . not only am i a teacher . . . but i am also a parent of a middlesex child . therefore , i am the only person here who transcends the parent teacher bridge .
kitty . . .
and how do they do this ? they flood the house . . . by breaking through the water main !
this meeting of the pta was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation . . .
chut up !
maybe martha moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus .
you know , there s , like , this rule . we get to go home at .
there s no rule !
all right ! . everybody goes home .
what is this shit ?
wicked .
no more fucking for her .
smurfette does not fuck .
bullshit . smurfette fucks all the other smurfs . that is why papa smurf made her , cause the other smurfs were getting too horny .
we got eggs , water balloons , and a dozen rolls of toilet paper .

i do not know that is keeping me . i should have been here a long time ago . now how about my proposition ?
what other job you got ?
let s see what have i got in my cabinet besides mice i have got it how would you like to be secretary of the interior ?
that is no good . i like to work on the outside . i must have something easy .
then you do not wanna work hard ?
i do not wanna work at all .
in that case you will have to take a civil service examination if you pass i will put you in the post office stick out your tongue .
i do not wanna stick out my tongue .
well , if you wanna work in the post office you will have to stick out your tongue .
look , i am a very nervous man . i gotta have a job where i come to work at eleven go to lunch at twelve and quit at one . and twice a year i gotta have a six month vacation .
i have got just the job for you secretary of war .
you know , i would be lost without a telephone . now where were we ? oh , yes i just made you secretary of war . the first thing you do is buy ammunition you buy it from me and i get commission .
what do i get ?
you get half mine and i get half yours .
i do not want to buy ammunition we no gotta war .
then we have gotta start one . do you know how to start a war ?
my card .
that is a no good . you gotta insult somebody from another country . look i come from one country . you come from another country . i say something you do not like . you say something i do not like and i am insulted .
why was not i insulted ?
you was insulted , but you do not know it .
then i demand an apology !
that is a no good . if i apologize we no got a war . look i send you a scrap of paper . you send me a scrap of paper and we have a scrap .
you have got a brain after all and how you get along without it is amazing to me now , who can i insult ? . . . who do we owe money to ? . . . ambassador trentino ! how about him ?
he is a very easy to insult i say something to his niece once , and he slapped my face .
why did not his niece slap your face ?
she did .
you are lucky i do not slap your face you oughtta be ashamed of yourself . where did you hear that story ?
you told it to me .
wait a minute . what kind of an army do you think we oughtta have ?
send in the next girl .
by the way , are you sure we need a spy ?
i am glad i did not ask you for washington crossing the delaware .
he is going to make a good spy . . . that is not bad for the first day .
you are right about that guy i think we have got something .
you no gotta no gun .
late again , eh ? you have not been on time once since this war started . . . get out there and fight . . .
i cannot do it . . .
why not ? you are the secretary of war , are not you ?
yes , but i am not working for you any more . i am on the other side .
now how many men you got in your army ?
well , we gotta one hundred thousand men .
that is not fair we have only got fifty thousand .
that is all right . we let you have twenty five thousand men and we both start even .
that is the spirit fifty fifty .
no . seventy five seventy five .
well , we will let that one go . now how many battalions you got ?
we gotta two battalions and one frenchman .
i wish you were still working for me , so i could ask you to resign . how are ya fixed for cavalry ?
i have gotta five thousand men but no horses .
that is funny , we have got five thousand horses but no men .
that is all right our men can ride your horses .
not a bad idea . if our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change . now , i do not mind letting you have our horses , but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers .
with a gun like that you can kill some of your own men .
that is a pretty good . i will take a dozen of them .

yes , one gross of bullets , two dozen hand grenades , three kegs of powder and throw in some matches .
fine . we will throw in the matches before we make the delivery . by the way , how are you fixed for spys ?

chicolini , you have come just in time . we need a man who s fearless , brave . a man who s willing to die , if necessary .
all right i will go out and find one .
firefly must be captured at any cost .
that is easy , i will get him for you wholesale .
it must be done right away .
we are not allowed to tell a dirty joke hail , hail , freedonia
if chewing gum is chewed , the chewer is pursued and in the hoosegow hidden . . .
if we should choose to chew , we will be pursued
i will not stand for anything that is crooked or unfair i am strictly on the up and up , so everyone beware . if anyone s caught taking graft and i do not get my share , we will stand em up against the wall and pop goes the weasel !
so everyone beware who s crooked or unfair no one must take a bit of graft unless he gets his share .
if any man should come between a husband and his bride , we find out which one she prefers by letting her decide . if she prefers the other man , the husband steps outside we stand him up against the wall and pop goes the weasel !
the husband steps outside relinquishes his bride we stand him up against the wall and take him for a ride .
your excellency , please do not think me silly , but i would love to have a picture of you . i want to hang it in my bedroom .
you keep that up and you will crab the whole war .
oh , your excellency , is not there something i can do ?
i shall dance for you tonight as i have never danced before .
this is a fine thing to be doing at my age .
are you getting tired ?
are you sure you are not tired ?
that is even a greater honor .
i bring you the greetings of my president and the good will of my people .
i will keep the greetings but you can send back the good will . . . what we need right now is twenty million dollars .
twenty million dollars is a considerable sum . . . i will have to discuss that with my minister of finance .
well , in the meantime , could you let me have personally ?
?
i will tell you what i will do . i will give you mrs . teasdale as security . or my jackknife . if you want my advice , you will take the jackknife . . . i have a better proposition . . . make it and i will give you a first mortgage on my son and i hope you foreclose .
your excellency , have not we met before ?
excellency , may i present my niece .
go ahead .
you do not understand . this is my niece vera .
when you get through with her feet , you can start on mine . i have not been to a chiropodist in two years . . . if that is not an insult , i do not know what is . gloria , i love you . i
cannot we go some place where we can be alone ?
this has gone far enough ! this interruption is humiliating , to say the least . . .
that is what you think .
you swine !
give me that again !
you worm !
once more !
you upstart !
then it is war ?
yes .
how are ya fixed for ammunition ?
bah ! !
i am sorry we lost our tempers . . . i am willing to forget if you are .
forget ? you ask me to forget . . . why , my ancestors would rise from their graves . . . and i would only have to bury them again . . . a firefly never forgets . . .
i am willing to apologize . . . i am willing to do anything to prevent this war .
what i called you . . . why , what did i call you ?
i do not remember .
oh you mean . . . worm ?
no , that was not it . . .
was it swine ?
no . . . it was a seven letter word .
oh yes ! upstart !
why er mrs . teasdale this is an outrage ! this man is impossible . . . my course is clear . . . this means war . . . you runt !
what will i do with this card ?
in choosing you , i feel that i serve my country well . i heartily endorse everything you stand for .
well , i will not stand for much . and i will not stand for you if you do not show some improvement soon . look at your report card last month d in spelling . . . six in behavior . now who were the six ? a fine state of affairs no wonder you cannot matriculate , now what were you saying ?
the future of freedonia rests upon you . promise me you will follow in my husband s footsteps .
i have not been on the job five minutes and already she is making advances to me . not that i care but where is your husband ?
why er my husband passed away . . . i was with him to the very end .
no wonder he passed away . i would like to be with you to the very end . cannot you see what i am trying to tell you i love you .
your excellency !
your excellency , the eyes of the world are upon you . notables from every land are gathered here in your honor this is a gala day for us .
well , a gal a day is enough for me . i could not handle any more .
if it is not asking too much for our information just for illustration tell us how you intend to run the nation .
you have made a wonderful impression . your views are liberal . . . it is easy to see you have an open mind .
that is what i get for dressing in a hurry .
your excellency , you must not forget your appointment at the house of representatives . . . have you got your speech ready ?
i wrote a speech last night that will knock them off their seats . . . four score and seven years ago , our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation
why , that is the speech that lincoln made at gettysburg . . .
oh , rufus !
all i can offer you is a rufus over your head .
oh , your excellency , i do not know what to say .
so you have come to ask for clemency ! i will give the enemy no quarter not a dime . . .
but your excellency the ambassador is here on a friendly visit . . . he came to ask you to patch up the breach .
oh , will not you reconsider . . .
guard them with your life . . . do not leave them out of your sight . . . if the enemy gets those papers we are lost . if they do not get them , we are lost . cannot you see what i am trying to tell you ? i love you . . . mrs . teasdale , you are the salt of the earth . they do not come any better than you . . .
now er
well they might come better but they do not come any bigger . . . and the bigger the better . the bigger the betta you have got on a horse , the more you lose , and speaking about horses , why do not you marry me . come , come say yes and you will never see me again . i will go way if it means your happiness . . .
gloria may i call you gloria ?
why why of course .
i hope i am not interrupting .
take a seat you are next .
your excellency , something terrible has just happened .
my purse has been stolen the plans of war are in it .
i i may be wrong , but i suspect the secretary of war .
do not bother me i am thinking what was that ?
i said i suspect the secretary of war .
this is treason ! ! what a fool i was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms
but
you know i think they think i should be king . although it would please me to govern the throng , suppose i were king and then everything went wrong .
your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis . without his country s financial aid
what is money ? mrs . teasdale , for you i would do anything .
ambassador ! i am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator .
. . . but would further cement the relations of our countries .
ambassador trentino , i am indeed honored . . . but you see well i
oh . then there his somebody else ?
well no not exactly but
gentlemen ! gentlemen !
i shall report this indignity the my president . mrs . teasdale , i feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war .
mrs . teasdale , i am willing to pocket my pride and do anything i can to make up with his excellency .
oh , would you . . . ?
so that is the one you want to marry .
with mrs . teasdale as my wife and freedonia under my control
maybe it is not going to be so easy . from what i have heard , mrs . teasdale is rather sweet on this rufus t . firefly .
uncle , you cannot do this !
my dear niece i must ask you not to interfere . war is not a womangs problem .
this is all firefly s fault that idiot , that fool . . .
i thought everything was working out fine .
fine nothing ! i did not want war . . . my plan was to marry mrs . teasdale and overthrow firefly .
if only we can get his excellency to listen to reason . . .
mr . merrick , sugar ?
yes please , two .
one or two ?
oh yes . you have so many nice things , and so much room .
and here is one of frederick s mother .
they have noble faces .
i have always thought that myself .
oh . . . why mr . merrick she is beautiful .
she has the face of an angel . . . she was an angel . she was so kind . . . so kind to me . it is not her fault , for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant . i am sure i must have been a great disappointment to her .
oh no , mr . merrick . no . no son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment .
you will not be long ?
did it go well , darling ?
yes , very well , i think . are the girls in bed ?
yes , and they send their kisses . would you like your sherry now ?
freddie ? . . . freddie , do not look so discouraged .
i should not be . we made great progress today . i taught him to repeat a few basic phrases . he did rather well , too , but i had to lead him every step of the way . though frankly , at times i was unsure of who was leading whom .
what do you mean ?
well , i was not sure whether he was parroting me because that is all he was capable of , or whether he sensed that that is all i wanted to hear , and he was trying to please me .
but i thought you said that he was rather . . . simple ?
frederick , why are you so interested in this particular case ?
perhaps you are just polishing a stone , endowing this elephant man with qualities he does not possess ?
and what qualities are those ? intelligence or stupidity ?
i am sorry . . . i do not know either . i just do not know .
well , these things take time .
john loves the house .
yes .
you stay with me .
more romances for john ?
hmmm ?
. . . freddie ! that is the matter ? you have been like this all evening .
oh . . . i have just been thinking about something that man bytes said .
oh , freddie . what could that wretched vampire say to upset you ?
that i am very little different from him .
oh that is absurd , frederick . no , no frederick , that is all wrong ! john is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life . and , that is completely due to you .
but why did i do it ? what was this all for ? so john merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort ? or so i could become famous ?
frederick , just what is it that you are saying ?
. . . am i a good man or am i a bad man ?
excuse me , mr . treves , sir .
yes ?
i found it .
our man is sick . come right away .
what is it ?
like this .
you sly bastard . you are doing this to spite me , are not you !
aw , bytes , he is sick .
he is doing it to spite me , i tell you , and it is got to stop !
he is sick , bytes . he is going to die .
what are you going to do ?
do not !
what did you do to him ? he is been like this all night !
what do you mean ?
he was fine when he left here , and now look at him .
what happened ?
he fell . he falls .
he is a clumsy git . never watches where he is going .
why is he sitting up like this ? he needs rest .
this man belongs in hospital .
cannot you fix him up here ? . . . he is my livelihood . listen .
i like doing business with you . you and i understand each other , completely . i know i can trust you . cannot i ?
i want my man back .
just a moment , how did you get in here ?
never mind that , i want my man !
he is still very sick . please come downstairs with me . i will explain the situation .
do not . . . do not muck me about . you have had plenty of time to fix him up , and he is leaving with me , now . do you understand me ? now , mr . treves . we had a bargain !
you misunderstood . this man suffered a severe fall , if you take my meaning . he is my patient now and i must do what . . .
pull the other one , why do not you ! we made a deal !
i know what you have done to him and he is never going back to that .
he is a freak ! that is how they live . we are partners , him and i , business partners . you are willfully depriving me of my livlihood !
all you do is profit from another mangs misery !
you think you are better n me ? you wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself , you guv . so i gave him to you . on trust , in the name of science ! and now i want him back .
you do not own this man !
i want him back !
so you can beat him ? so you can starve him ? a dog in the street would fare better with you !
now i think we really do understand one another .
good morning , treves .
good morning , sir .
you have acquired a taste for this ?
it is quite nutritious , sir .
do not be frightened . he will not hurt you .
a hospital is no place for secrecy , mr . treves . doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment . why was not this patient properly admitted , and why is he in isolation ? is he contagious ?
no sir , he is got bronchitis and he is been badly beaten .
why is not he in the general ward , then ?
well sir , he is quite seriously deformed , and i fear the other patients would find him . . . rather shocking .
deformed ? is that it . then am i to assume that he is ultimately incurable ?
yes sir .
what are your plans then , treves . . . you are aware that the london does not accept incurables . the rules are quite clear on that point .
yes , i am well aware of that . but this case is quite exceptional .
oh , is he a friend of yours ?
i certainly sympathize with your problem , treves . . . why do not you try the british home , or the royal hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him .
have you contacted the british home and the royal hospital ?
ah , no sir . i had planned to see them in the morning .
good ! how is the patient ?
he is doing very well . in fact that is why i came to see you . i think that if i were to present mr . merrick to the hospital committee , then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease , but of the man as well . if the committee had a chance to speak with him , hear him say a few words for himself , i am sure they would see him as a patient , rather than as a violation of the rules .
a few words ? i thought he was imbecile ?
well sir , perhaps i should explain . . .
i really do not think that is necessary treves . i am quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case , such as they are .
i do not agree . no one can make a reasonable decision about this mangs future without at least meeting him . no doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met .
no , treves , it is out of the question . now if it was up to me , i would say certainly , let s meet the fellow , by all means , i am sorry , i simply cannot speak for the other members of the committee .
then will you meet him , as a representative of the committee .
singularly unpleasant chap . . . uh . . . i do not suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your . . . patient , mr . treves .
thank you very much sir . shall we say in a few days then ?
shall we say two o clock tomorrow afternoon ?
wh . . . whatever is most convenient for you , sir .
two o clock then . . . you know treves . . . it seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance .
it is only a physical problem . he has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth . but he can talk , and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him . so if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying , just tell me and i will make it clear .
. . . as i said , it is only a physical problem . . . but i do feel that mr . merrick is very flattered that you are taking the time and trouble to meet him , and he is most anxious to make a good impression , so he might seem rather nervous .
he need not . i have no desire to cause him any discomfort . did you make those inquiries we spoke about ?
yes , i spoke to both the british home and royal hospital for incurables . i am afraid that they were not very encouraging , but they said they would bring it up at their next committee meeting , so we should have their answers shortly .
oh yes ?
it was a nice try , treves , but the man is so obviously mouthing your words .
yes , i am very sorry to have wasted your time , sir . i just felt that i had to do anything i could to protect him .
how did you , know the rest ? i never taught you the rest of it .
i do not understand .
treves . well done .
can you imagine what his life has been like ?
yes , i think i can .
you are quite right , treves , this is an exceptional case . and i quite agree that the committee should see mr . merrick .
i could easily arrange . . .
no , not that way . broadneck and the others do not like to deal with patients directly . it makes them queasy . . . do you have any photographs of mr . merrick ?
well , yes .
excellent . we shall present them , along with the other particulars of the case to the committee . i want them to see , exactly , how horribly his body has been affected . you and i shall vouch for his inner qualities .
do you think they will go along with us ?
do not we ?
no , we do not . their committees have informed me that they are unwilling to take mr . merrick , even if they were supplied with funds . they do not want him .
has the response picked up ?
frankly , treves , it is not what i would expected . a few small cheques . well wishers . do not worry , these things undoubtedly take time .
but he is so afraid he is going to be carted off . i have promised him that will not happen .
well . . . i will let you know if there s something in the afternoon post .
do not you think this is a bit premature ? we do not have the backing yet to . . .
how are you feeling today ?
i feel much better . thank you for asking . and you ?
i am feeling very fit , thank you . how is your bronchitis ?
i feel much better . thank you .
are you comfortable here ?
. . . i . . . everyone has been very kind to me .
. . . everyone has been very kind .
what is it , treves ?
it was a great pleasure to meet you , mr . merrick .
i am very pleased to meet you .
how long has this man been here ?
three quarters of an hour .
abominable things these machines . one cannot reason with them .
i say freddie , what are you about ?
good lord , freddie ! what have you got in there ?
you will know presently . at the meeting of the society . but until then , i beg of you fox , keep it to yourself .
certainly , if you insist . you must have quite a find there .
i do not know what i have got .
you never mentioned his mental state .
fair katharine , and most fair , will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms such as will enter at a lady s ear and plead his love suit to her gentle heart ?
your majesty shall mock at me i cannot speak your england .
o fair katharine , if you will love me soundly with your french heart , i will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your english tongue . do you like me , kate ?
pardonnez moi , i cannot tell vat is like me .
an angel is like you , kate , and you are like an angel .
o bon dieu ! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies .
what say you , fair one ? that the tongues of men are full of deceits ?
oui , dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits .
good day . . . !
i have brought you some things . i hope you will like , mr . merrick . i hope you do not think it too forward .
oh , no .
i want you to know that i do not go about giving my pictures to just anyone .
she is very pretty , your mother .
mr . treves says that you are in the theatre . do you live there ?
oh no , mr . merrick . i just work there .
well , even to work there would be wonderful . is it beautiful ?
you have never been ?
alas , no .
well you must go . it is one of the most beautiful places on earth . of course , i am rather partial .
tell me about it , please !
it is very difficult to put into a nutshell , but i should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination , where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world , to any time you desire . you may look over the shoulders of kings , unobserved , battle with ruthless tyrants , and marry the beautiful princess , all in the space of a few hours . onstage you may be whoever you wish to be , do anything you please , and always , always live happily ever after . the theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world , mr . merrick . it is lights and music , gaiety and joy . it is . . . well , it is romance .
romance !
have you read it ?
have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ?
ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .
why , mr . merrick , you are not an elephant man at all . . .
oh no ?
john , i would like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the british stage , mrs . kendal . mrs . kendal , john merrick .
it is all arranged . i will send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany mr . merrick . you will be using the royal entrance and princess alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box .
i am very grateful to you , mrs . kendal . this is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal . john will be very excited .
well it is a miracle he ever got back . and , i am sure , mr . treves , under your expert care , he will have many happy years ahead .
i fear not , mrs . kendal . even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly . . . as is his pain .
how awful for john .
and yet , not once have any of us heard him complain .
is he . . . dying then ?
yes . there is nothing more frustrating , nothing that makes a physician feel more useless , than standing by watching his patient deteriorate . and when that patient is a friend , no . . . no , there s absolutely nothing i can do .
well , it is all quite . . . i have never heard . . . it is quite . . .
you alright ?
y y yes
want to come out ?
you are english .
of course ! you want out ?
yes .
i am sorry i could only get you a third class ticket , but it is all we had .
oh no , my friend . . .
say hello to london for me . i miss her .
oh , yes .
feeling better now , mr . merrick ?
thank you very much .
well , if there is nothing more , i suppose we will be leaving you now .
good morning , mr . merrick .
what ? oh ! i see ! it is st . phillips . oh , of course . why . . . why that is very good , i mean you have gotten the windows and arches just right .
yes .
but it is so good , i mean . . . it is so very good .
thank you . . . very much .
the hallway ? oh , the wastecan !
i meant no harm , it was the only place where i could find cardboard . i thought it has been thrown away .
that is this ?
the main spire .
the . . . oh , the spire ! how silly of me , it is as plain as day . . . mr . merrick , where did you learn to do this ?
i will have to find some more .
yyyy . . . yyye . . . yyyess .
. . . yyes
yyyess .
yyess .
that is much better . i could understand that yes .
yes !
very good ! oh yes ! now listen . i am going to say some things to you and i want you to repeat them . . . um . . . i want you to say them back to me . do you understand ? i am going to say some things to you and i want you to say them back to me . do you understand ?
yes .

mr . merrick likes the food here . do not you john ?
. . . yes potatoes . . . but . . .
why did you let me go on like that , teaching you what you already knew ? why did not you tell me you could read ?
you did not ask me .
i never thought to ask . how can you ever forgive me ?
oh , no do not say that . you have been so kind to me . i was afraid to say too much . people always want me to be quiet . you wanted me to speak , but i was afraid . forgive me .
good evening . how are you feeling ?
good evening . very well , thank you . and you ?
this . . . is my new home ?
yes .

how long will i stay here ?
you look splendid , john .
thank you very much .

good morning , john .
good morning .
when will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye ? when will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky ? when will the clouds be aweary of fleeting ? when will the heart be aweary of beating , and nature die ?
mr . treves , there is something i have been meaning to ask you for some time . . .
yes , john ?
no john , i cannot . i can care for you , but i cannot cure you .
the cathedral is coming along nicely .
how blind of me . is there anything else , john , anything at all that i could get for you ?
oh no ! there is nothing ! i have everything , you have given me everything i could possibly want . i am happy every hour of the day . i only wish there was something i could give to you .
you want a dressing bag , john ?
. . . my . . . home ?
yes , john .
you did this for me ?
yes .
my home .
is it the one you wanted ?
oh , mr . treves . mr . treves .
are you sure ? because i can take it back .
mr . treves ! treves .
stand up , john . let them see you .
oh no , i could not .
will the cathedral be finished soon , john ?
yes , very soon .
splendid . it is truly a masterpiece . well , i suppose i will be on my way now . i hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening .
oh yes ! it was wonderful !
yes john ?
mr . treves , tell me . . . tell me truly . is it alright , did i make any mistakes that you can see ?
no , john , not one that i can see .
then i should not change anything ?
goodnight john . sleep well .
ah , mothershead . how are you feeling today ?
fine .
good . excellent . now then , mrs . mothershead , i want you to come into this room with me . inside there is a man with a rather . . . unfortunate appearance .
i have heard .
yes . . . well , i want you to clear up a little mess , a breakfast tray was spilt . and bring up another breakfast . when you have done that , you and i shall give the man a bath . but , mothershead , i am counting on your many years of experience to get you through this , above all , do not scream , do not cry out , or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him . . .
sir , you do not have to worry about me . i am not the sort to cry out . shall we go in ?
the workhouse .
good morning , mr . treves . it will be his bath time soon . has he eaten ?
will not come out , eh ?
no , he is very upset about something .
he is had his share of smacks , mothershead . i expect that is what drives him under the bed . we must use patience and understanding with this man .
good lord , mr . treves !
we have made tremendous strides today , mothershead . he listens and repeats with great attention , and this certainly is not easy for him .
parrots can do as much , mr . treves . it is all very nice , but i do not see the point . you know they will not let him stay here .
watery headed bunch .
incredible , is not it ? well , i think john has had enough visitors for one day , mothershead . i have got a lecture at the college , i will be back this evening .
excuse me , sir . i would like to have a word with you .
oh ? . . . well , quickly please , mothershead , i am overdue .
i cannot understand why you let those people go in there , sir .
now mothershead , you have to understand that this is very good for john . he relishes contact with people outside the hospital . . .
but you saw them , sir . they could not hide their disgust . they do not care anything for john , they are just trying to impress their friends .
are not you being just a little harsh , mothershead ? you yourself hardly treated john with much loving kindness when he first arrived .
i bathed him , did not i ? i fed him and cleaned up after him ! if loving kindness can be called care and practical concern , then yes , i did treat him with loving kindness , and i am not ashamed to say it .
mr . treves , some more books arrived for mr . merrick .
thank you , mothershead . have a porter put them in my office .
yes sir . that is that ?
a dressing bag .
very smart indeed .
yes . john wants it .
a dressing bag ?
you do not think it is too gaudy , do you .
well . . .
so you see , john , there s no need for a lighthouse . all your friends are here .
where is mr . merrick ?
do not lie to me . i know all about it . you were seen . where did you take him ?
take him ? now wait . . . i did not take him anywhere . we were just having some fun . we did not hurt him . . . just having a laugh , that is all .
he is gone !
when i left him , he was in his bed , safe and sound .
you bastard ! you tortured him . you tortured him , you bastard . where is he ?
you are not listening to me ! i ai not done nothing wrong . people pay to see your monster , mr . treves . i just take the money .
are you the proprietor ?
and who might you be , sir ?
just one of the curious . i would like to see it .
i would pay handsomely for a private showing . are you the proprietor ?
handsomely ? . . . who sent you ?
pardon me ?
so you will bring him to me , tomorrow , a . m . ? mr . . . ?
bytes . mr . bytes . he will be there .
open up ! i know you are in there !
ah ! it is my father !
right ! where is he ?
who , father ?
who ? who ? whoever you have got in here of course !
well . . . where is he ?
ah ! so you admit there is someone !
it is all in your own mind , father . . . it is you who imagine that i am always up here with some man or other . . . .
there is no magic , father . . . my mother had no magic . . .
she did , i tell you ! she could blind me as easily as the night the day .
it is your fantasy . . .
it is all right ! it is not happening !
it is sinking ! hy brasil is sinking !
what did you say ?
i said welcome .
welcome ?
how d you know we are friends ?
please ! please ! what are those ?
what are what ?
those things in your hands .
that is the matter ?
please ! you do not know what you are doing !
what ?
why ?
yes .
have you ever felt like this about anyone else ?
what . . . you mean got into bed with them ?
no , of course not , silly i mean felt like this about them ?
you mean . . . you have got into bed with somebody else ?
no , i mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you would met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart . . . someone whose goals suddenly seem to be your goals . . . whose dreams seem to be your dreams ?
have you ever been to bed with anyone else ?
what does that matter ? but you have . . . you have . . . felt like this before . . .
it was different . . .
what was she like ?
oh . . . oh , i did not know her very well . . .
but you loved her all the same . . .
we never went to bed together .
why do you go on about that ? what does it matter ?
you have been to bed with somebody else , have not you ?
i have never loved anybody !
the cloak invisible . it was my mother s parting gift .
the fifth one this week !
oh , for goodness sake !
that is just what i was trying to tell you . you are . . .
five this week how many the week before ?
you are as bad as my father .
we must not let him land !
who ?
halfdan the black .
just give me a hand .
where is the cloak invisible ?
no !
i will bring it back .
erik . you do not understand .
no . it is you who does not understand , aud . halfdan has come to kill and destroy . we brought him here . we must stop him .
but you do not realize . . . .
and thanks for the cloak invisible !
no ! no ! we are in the spell of the horn ! hatred will destroy us .
no . do not look . . . the abyss will suck away your strength .
you still want to go to asgaard ?
of course .
do you believe i love you ?
i . . . but i . . .
you do not have to love me . just do you believe i love you ?
yes i believe you do .
the second note .
erik ! you have done what you came to do !
blow the third note ! the note to take us home !
there is something i must ask the gods . . .
then i shall come too .
no . . . no . . .
i do not want to live without you .
loki ! where did you come from ?
but
but . . . how is it you can see me ? you can all see me ?
how do we know this is the way ?
we blew the horn resounding .
now what can you want with me , erik the viking ?
i should not have come .
what do you see , erik ?
i see the world .
is it night or day , erik ?
it is day , of course , freya .
have you ever seen the sun , erik ?
the sun is up beyond the clouds where it always is .
but have you ever seen it ? think back . . .
of course not . . . but . . . when i was a child . . . i remember a dream . . . . it was as if the whole sky was blue . . .
is there nothing men can do ?
the gods are asleep , erik .
and will the dead ever return , freya ?
no . . . we do not . . .
how ?
well . . . for a start . . . er . . . there s no killing . . .
well , obviously there s no killing .
would you like us to sing to you ?
that is the matter , do not you want to hear our singing ?
oh . . . well , yes , of course it is just we are looking for the horn resounding and
you do not think our singing s going to be good enough for you ?
oh , no no no ! it is just the horn resounding is . . .
a lot of people like our singing .
i am sure it is lovely .
but you do not want to hear it .
er . . . well . . . we . . . we . . . would be terribly grateful if you . . . all . . . would sing for us .
of course we are not we would genuinely like to hear you sing .
really ?
really .
no .
we are just not a very musical nation . . .
no , no . . . it was very . . . er , nice .
no .
your majesty ! we come from a world where there is no music . where men live and die by the axe and by the sword . . .
well , how d you think i feel ?
the gods are asleep , king arnulf .
i will tell you what . . .
careful ! they are not supposed to hurt you .
it is all part of our safety regulations . you see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then . . . well . . .
he is trying to stop us waking the gods .
why ?
because that is how he makes his money , by war and plunder !
do not talk nonsense .
he wants to kill us !
not when we explain about the great blessing .
you do not know halfdan the black .
is there something the matter with it ?
oh ! no ! no . . . of course not . . . it is just i had not expected it to be quite so big .
well , it is not called the horn resounding for nothing . you do know how to play the horn , do not you ?
yes . . . oh , yes . . .
but it is ! look !
have you done this sort of thing before ?
me ? of course ! i have been looting and pillaging up and down the coast .
looting and pillaging , eh ?
yes .
what about the raping ?
shut up .
it is obvious you have not raped anyone in your life .
of course i like women . . . i love em .
you do not love me .
no . . . right . . . this is rape . . . mark you , i am not saying i could not get to like you . . . in fact . . . well , to be quite honest , i prefer it when there s some sort of mutual feeling between two people . . .
what rape ?
no . it is not rape then , is it ?
oh , get it over with .
i do not suppose . . . no . . .
what ?
i do not suppose you . . . you do like me at all ?
i will kill you if you say anything about this to anyone .
about raping me ?
about not raping you . . .
you do not like it , do you ?
well it just seems a little bit crude , that is all .
what about the killing and looting ? that is just as crude , is not it ?
oh well you have got to do them .
why ? why have you got to go round killing and looting ?
to pay for the next expedition , of course .
but that is a circular argument ! if the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition , they cancel each other out .
oh ! stop talking as if we were married !
well you started it .
i just said i did not feel like raping you .
scream .
ah .
louder .
aaagh ! rape !
thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death .
i did not mean to !
you told them i raped you why ?
i dunno . . . you looked so . . . so vulnerable . . .
why should you care ?
why . . . should you care ?
i have come to take you back to the land of the living .
what a stupid idea .
why ?
that is the point of being dead in the land of the living ?
have you tried to ask the god for anything ?
is that odin ?
you will have to wait till he is finished his game .
why should you care ?
find the rainbow bridge ?
but what ?
but . . .
nothing . . . halfdan the black chopped his hand off last night .
what are you talking about ?
it is halfdan the black !
erik ! row ! what are you doing ?
how deep is the ocean ?
let s hack her to pieces .
that is wrong with making friends ?
that is terrible !
halfdan the black s here !
i know !
but . you are not even afraid of death , thorfinn !
it is not magic ! it is just a trick !
we are missing all the fun . . .
that is it all about ?
what ?
we toil and labor , we loot and pillage , rape and kill . . . and yet . . .
you talking piffle , son ?
where does it all get us , grandpa ?
who have you been talking to ?
i met this girl . . .
it is always the women that start the trouble .
she got me thinking . . .
i . . . i . . . killed her . . .
he can have my place . i do not want to go anyway .
i want to die . . . no , i do not !
slower ! nobody can row at that speed !
slower ! in . . . out . . .
faster !
what are you doing here ?
ohh ! i wanted to sit next to leif .
shut up !
look , the sky is blue . . .
it is magic .
what magic ?
what magic have you brought , erik ?
what did he say ?
you must help us .
we do not have to help anybody .
fenrir the wolf covers the sun men fight and kill each other the whole time .
why should we care ?
because . . . you are . . . you are the gods . . . .
so ?
erik the viking ! the things you seek are not in our power . we do not make men love each other or hate each other .
but you are the gods !
you mean we would be dead ?
thank you very much indeed .
now stop it !
it is so nice to feel wanted .
leif , you sit there . even , you sit there . harald , you would better sit over there . . .
you cannot have svengs father sitting next to sven . they will argue the whole time .
that is true . you would better sit there . you there , and ornulf there .
that is better .
row !
first we are flying now we are sinking !
listen ! maybe we will not get to hy brasil ! maybe we will not find the horn resounding . . . but at least we have tried . . . and at least we shall have died like men .
a magic dishcloth .
were not we supposed to ?
no ! let go , snorri !
i have got you !
you will be sucked down too !
there is another way .
who gets killed ?
you need to say a bit more than that !
that is the matter with them ?
just say something cheerful .
i think we should go . . .
right . farewell . . . for the last time . . . may the gods prevent . . .
wait , erik !
bjorngs not . he could have bjorngs place .
what do you think ?
and you , keitel blacksmith .
well , what else do we do ?
so halfdan the black s using magic , is he ? well , i have a magic to match his !
do not you see , erik ! she wants revenge !
and you , sven , are not you afraid of crossing the rainbow bridge to asgaard ?
what are you talking about , erik ?
only the dead reach asgaard , erik .
nobody s ever crossed the rainbow bridge to asgaard .
but how ?
hey , you two ! that is going on ?
look , i bagged it last week .
it does not matter where you sit !
yes it does ! we could be at sea for months .
well , what difference does it make where you are sitting ?
i am one , dad !
row !
she has not got any .
hy brasil ?
we must blow the first note . . . he note that will take us to asgaard . . .
sven !
i came to find my grandfather .
bye , leif .
bye . . . sorry . . .
yeah . . . well . . .
you will wait ?
that is why they call me . . . leif the lucky .
that is all the panic about ?
it cannot do you any harm . . .
what do we have to do ?
how did he do that ?
do what ?
vanish into thin air ?
he has not .
you coming ? you do not even believe in asgaard .
i thought i might do a bit of business on the way .
you are wasting your time .
listen . i have been in this dump for sixteen years and i have not made a single convert . . .
there was thorbjorn vifilssongs wife . you converted her .
thorbjorn vifilssongs wife became a buddhist , not a christian .
same thing , is not it ?
you know , my son , our lord said . . .
your lord .
quite . . . my lord . . . said the prayer of faith shall have the sick .
are you all right ?
no , i am not .
you do not need to feel bad about being sea sick , you know .
how can you help feeling bad when you are sea sick ?
i know . i know .
olaf tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage . . . the whole time . . . non stop . . . puke . . . puke . . . puke .
he used to puke in his sleep .
is it sort of . . . like a sinking feeling in your stomach ?
and a sort of slightly sick feeling ?
that is it ! and you keep wanting to go to the lavatory .
oh ! who cares ? we are home !
aaagh !
let me go , sven .
what are you talking about ?
i am not worth risking your life for .
i have got you , keitel blacksmith . if you go . . . i go too . . .
for your own sake . . . for the others . . . i . . .
well ! come on !
who s that ?
it is me . i am just going to water the dragon . . .
what ?
what are you doing , keitel blacksmith ?
get away , snorri .
ooh , that is a good one ! you could charge halfdan fifteen for that one .
yes , it is good . but i told him ten .
you just cannot make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand . you could charge halfdan twenty and he would pay it .
oh , i could not do that ! the blacksmith s code says . . .
if this is the age of ragnarok , keitel blacksmith , it is good to us .
cannot make enough swords !
cannot make enough axe heads !
they chase fenrir the wolf from the sky . . .
the age of ragnarok ends . . .
the bottom falls out of the sword business !
it is not just your livelihood that is at stake but your songs , and the livelihood of all blacksmiths .
my brother blacksmiths !
that is right .
the blacksmith s code says i must . . .
honour and protect all blacksmiths .
together we stand !
was not it , keitel ?
are you going to let erik wake the gods ?
sh ! hurry !
you do it !
i cannot swim ! i cannot swim !
relax !
urrgh ! argh ! let go , you idiot !
help !
help !
shut up !
she knows it was our fault !
keep your mouth shut , keitel !
you have lost your mind .
we came to stop you waking the gods , erik ! but i did not want anyone to get hurt !
i should have got rid of you long ago !
made by you , loki !
by you keitel blacksmith ! do not you know , erik , that is why he went with you ? ragnarok was good for his business . . .
it is a tradition .
i know , dad .
i was a berserk for king harald fairhair . . .
you went berserk . . .
i went berserk in every battle i ever fought for king harald . . .
so did your father . . .
so did my father and his father before him .
but it is a responsibility . . .
but it is a responsibility being a berserk .
i must only let the red rage . . .
you must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle .
we are being attacked ! kill ! kill ! kill !
not now , sven . . .
i must kill ! kill !
kill ! kill !
hold it ! hold it in !
well , of course he is !
there ! that is a true berserk .
well , go on ! go berserk !
there is nothing we can do . . .
he drove me mad !
easy , dad !
and his you will never be a berserk if you lose your temper . . .
dad !
he is not in valhalla ! he died of old age !
well i am certainly not , either .
well . . . i am game .
shut up .
thorfinn ! you cannot die !
i am not frightened . . . of anything . . .
you will see my grandfather in valhalla !
no . . . he is not . . . not . . . there . . .
and you have got both axes ?
yes , mother .
and something to sharpen them with ?
yes , mum .
and do not forget never let your enemy get behind you .
no , mother .
and keep your sword greased .
and if you have to kill somebody , kill them ! do not stop to think about it .
i do not know , honey . it is horrible .
maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on . just make a clean break .
you were not supposed to see that .
they cannot erase memories . it is a joke . it is a nasty clementine hoax .
thanks , guys .
i hope you feel better , sweetie .
yeah .
i am sorry naomi could not make it . you okay ? you seem quiet .
i remember you turned around . your face was dark and your hair was backlit i could see a halo of frizz you asked me if things were okay between naomi and me .
i did . you said , things were fine .
i remember .
this is the night you met clementine , joel . i remember watching you walk down the beach with her and i thought , oh shit .
yeah , you told me that later .
who was the girl you walked off with ?
shit . the last time i saw you .
but i thought , i do not know , i thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what i was feeling and that you were attracted to it .
but , i do not know , maybe we are the normal ones , y know ? i mean , what kind of people do well at this stuff ?
and i just liked you so much .
no , it was lovely .
may i help you ?
yeah , hi , i have a one o clock with dr . mierzwiak . clementine kruczynski .
ms . kruczynski ?
how are you today ?
okay , i guess .
i just thought i would say hi . i was in the neighborhood .
you were not .
come over after i am done here ?
i cannot . i want to , but i have to study .
you rat .
it is so cool . you are by far the most sensational person in the room .
in the room ?
oh , baby , that is going on ?
i do not know . i am lost . i am scared . i feel like i am disappearing . i am getting old and nothing makes any sense to me .
oh , tangerine .
come up to boston with me ?
sure . we will go next weekend and
now . now ! i have to go now . i have to see the frozen charles ! now ! tonight !
um , okay . i will call my study partner .
i am so excited . yay !
i did not have a chance to wrap it .
that is wrong with me ?
how are you today ?
okay , i guess .
well , i have been having a bad time of it with um , my boyfriend , i guess .
you guess he is your boyfriend ? or you guess you are having a bad time with him ?
maybe gay is not the right word . but , anyway , it is been rough with him . . . whatever the fuck he is . heheh . my significant other . . . heh heh . and i guess on a certain level , i want to break it off , but i feel . . . y know . . . it is like this constant questioning and re questioning . do i end it ? should i give it more time ? i am not happy , but what do i expect ? relationships require work . you know the drill . the thing that i keep coming back to is , i am not getting any younger , i want to have a baby . . . at some point . . . maybe . . . right ? so then i think i should settle which is not necessarily the best word i mean , he is a good guy . it is not really settling . then i think maybe i am just a victim of movies , y know ? that i have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be . but then i think , no , this is what i really want , so i should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it . you know ? agreed ? but then i think he is a good guy and . . . it is complicated . y know ?
i am sorry .
why ?
why what ?
why are you sorry ? i just said hi .
really ?
well , i did not want to assume .
aw , c mon , live dangerously . take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car .
it is okay if i sit closer ? so i do not have to scream . not that i do not need to scream sometimes , believe me . but i do not want to bug you if you are trying to write or something .
no , i mean , i do not know . i cannot really think of much to say probably .
i mean , it is okay if you want to sit down here . i did not mean to
no , i do not want to bug you if you are trying to
it is okay , really .
just , you know , to chat a little , maybe . i have a long trip ahead of me . how far are you going ? on the train , i mean , of course .
rockville center .
get out ! me too ! what are the odds ?
the weirder part is i think actually i recognize you . i thought that earlier in the diner . that is why i was looking at you . you work at borders , right ?
ucch , really ? you are kidding . god . bizarre small world , huh ? yeah , that is me book slave there for , like , five years now .
really ? because
jesus , is it five years ? i gotta quit right now .
because i go there all the time . i do not think i ever saw you before .
well , i am there . i hide in the back as much as is humanly possible . you have a cell phone ? i need to quit right this minute . i will call in dead .
i do not have one .
i will go on the dole . like my daddy before me .
i noticed your hair . i guess it made an impression on me , that is why i was pretty sure i recognized you .
ah , the hair . blue , right ? it is called blue ruin . the color . snappy name , huh ?
i like it .
blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering .
yeah . tom waits says it in
exactly ! tom waits . which song ?
i cannot remember .
anyway , this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names . red menace , yellow fever , green revolution . that would be a job , coming up with those names . how do you get a job like that ? that is what i will do . fuck the dole .
i do not really know how
purple haze , pink eraser .
you think that could possibly be a full time job ? how many hair colors could there be ?
someone s got that job . agent orange ! i came up with that one . anyway , there are endless color possibilities and i would be great at it .
i am sure you would .
my writing career ! your hair written by clementine kruczynski . the tom waits album is rain dogs .
you sure ? that does not sound
i think . anyway , i have tried all their colors . more than once . i am getting too old for this . but it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality . i apply my personality in a paste . you ?
oh , i doubt that is the case .
well , you do not know me , so . . . you do not know , do you ?
sorry . i was just trying to be nice .
my name s clementine , by the way .
i am joel .
no jokes about my name ? oh , you would not do that you are trying to be nice .
i do not know any jokes about your name .
huckleberry hound ?
i do not know what that means .
huckleberry hound ! what , are you nuts ?
i am not nuts .
oh my darling , oh my darling , oh my darling clementine ? no ?
sorry . it is a pretty name , though . it means merciful , right ?
yeah . although it hardly fits . i am a vindictive little bitch , truth be told .
see , i would not think that about you .
why would not you think that about me ?
oh . i do not know . i was just . . . i do not know . i was . . . you seemed nice , so
now i am nice ? do not you know any other adjectives ? there s careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative . . . mumpish .
i do not need nice . i do not need myself to be it and i do not need anyone else to be it at me .
okay .
joel ? it is joel , right ?
yes ?
i am sorry i . . . yelled at you . was it yelling ? i cannot really tell . whatever , i am a little out of sorts today .
that is okay .
my embarrassing admission is i really like that you are nice . right now , anyway . i cannot tell from one moment to the next what i am going to like . but right now i am glad you said , that is okay to me . that was nice of you .
it is no problem . anyway , i have some stuff i need to
oh , okay . well , sure , i will just . . . take care , then .
probably see you at the book store .
hi . i could give you a ride if you need .
no , that is okay . thanks , though .
you are sure ? it is cold .
i do not want to take you out of your way .
it is okay .
where do you live ?
you are not a stalker or anything , right ?
well , i probably would not say if i were , but no .
you cannot be too careful . i have been stalked . i have been told i am highly stalkable . i do not need that .
i am not a stalker .
you know wilmont ?
yeah .
look , i am very sorry i came off sort of nutso . i am not really .
so you like bookstores , huh ?
i like to read .
me too . it is rain dogs , by the way .
yeah ? i cannot remember that album very well . i remember liking it . but
the song s th and hennepin . i spent most of the train ride trying to remember . till you are full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin and you spill out over the side to anyone who will listen . remember ?
sort of , um . . .
remember ? and you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there and i am lost in the window i hide on the stairway i hang in the curtain i sleep in your hat . . . oh , shit . i am so stupid . sorry .
what ?
thanks very much . that was very nice of you .
well , i would not want to be
take care .
hey , do you want to have a drink ? i have lots of drinks . and i could
um
you like that ?
very much .
thanks . that was good , that crow sound .
do you believe in that stuff ? reincarnation ?
i do not know .
me neither . oh , there s an inscription on the back . the way a crow shook down on me the dust of snow from a hemlock tree has given my heart a change of mood and saved some part of a day i rued .
frost ?
yeah . i am not , like , a robert frost lover by any stretch . his stuff seems strictly grade school to me . but this made me cry for some reason . maybe because it is grade school . y know ?
it is pretty .
i miss grade school . i do not know why i am calling it grade school all of a sudden . when i went we called it elementary school . but i like grade school better . sounds like something someone from the forties would call it . i would like to be from then . everyone wore hats . anyway , cheers !
god , that feels so fucking good . take yours off .
i am fine .
ready for another ?
what do you want to hear ?
you pick it .
you just say . i am not really
well , i should probably get going .
no , stay . just for a little while . refill ?
no . i
thanks .
y know , i am sort of psychic .
yeah ?
well , i go to a psychic and she is always telling me i am psychic . she should know . do you believe in that stuff ?
i do not know .
me neither . but sometimes i have premonitions , so , i do not know . maybe that is just coincidence . right ? y know , you think something and then it happens , or you think a word and then someone says it ? y know ?
yeah , i do not know . it is hard to know .
exactly . exactly ! that is exactly my feeling about it . it is hard to know . like , okay , but how many times do i think something and it does not happen ? that is what you are saying , right ? you forget about those times . right ?
yeah , i guess .
but i think i am . i like to think i am .
it is helpful to think there s some order to things . you are kind of closed mouthed , are not you ?
sorry . my life is not that interesting . i go to work . i go home . i do not know what to say .
oh . does that make you sad ? or anxious ? i am always anxious thinking i am not living my life to the fullest , y know ? taking advantage of every possibility ? just making sure that i am not wasting one second of the little time i have .
you are really nice . i am sorry i yelled at you before about it . god , i am an idiot .
i do have a tendency to use that word too much .
i like you . that is the thing about my psychic thing . i think that is my greatest psychic power , that i get a sense about people . my problem is i never trust it . but i get it . and with you i get that you are a really good guy .
thanks .
and , anyway , you sell yourself short . i can tell . there s a lot of stuff going on in your brain . i can tell . my goal . . . can i tell you my goal ?
yeah .
that is the goal , joel ? my goal , joel , is to just let it flow through me ? do you know what i mean ? it is like , there s all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and i think we are all taught we should be consistent . y know ? you love someone that is it . forever . you choose to do something with your life that is it , that is what you do . it is a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through . and my feeling is that is how you die , because you stop listening to what is true , and what is true is constantly changing . you know ?
yeah . i think so . it is hard to
like i wanted to talk to you . i did not need any more reason to do it . who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist ?
yeah .
you are very nice . god , i have to stop saying that . you are nervous around me , huh ?
no .
i am nervous . you do not need to be nervous around me , though . i like you . do you think i am repulsively fat ?
no , not at all .
well , for the last week , anyway ! he is kind of a kid . kind of a goofball , but he is really stuck on me , which is flattering . who would not like that ? and he is , like , a dope , but he says these smart and moving things sometimes , out of nowhere , that just break my heart . he is the one who gave me that crow photograph .
oh , yeah .
that made me cry . but , anyway , we went up to boston , because i had this urge to lie on my back on the charles river . it gets frozen this time of year .
that is scary sounding .
exactly ! i used to do it in college and i had this urge to go do it again , so i got patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me , but i was really disappointment to be there with him . y know ? and that is where psychic stuff comes in . like , it just is not right with him . y know ?
i think so .
i do not believe in that soulmate crap anymore , but . . . he says so many great things . we like the same writers . this writer stephen dixon he turned me on to . and he is cute . it is fucked up . joel , you should come up to the charles with me sometime .
okay .
i will pack a picnic a night picnic night picnics are different and
sounds good . but right now i should go .
you should stay .
i have to get up early in the morning tomorrow , so . . .
i would like you to call me . would you do that ? i would like that .
so , i enjoyed meeting you .
you will call me , right ?
yeah .
when ?
tomorrow ?
tonight . just to test out the phone lines and all .
how could she have done this to me ? how could anyone do this to anyone ?
yo ho ho !
i cannot believe you wrecked my car . you are driving drunk . it is pathetic .
. . . a little . i was a little tipsy . do not call me pathetic .
i do not know , maybe you did kill somebody .
a wino ? jesus , are you from the fifties ? a wino ! face it , joel . you are freaked out because i was out late without you , and in your little wormy brain , you are trying to figure out , did she fuck someone tonight ?
let me drive you home .
fuck you , joel . faggot .
how can you watch this crap ?
where are you going ?
oh shit . i remember this . want to go ?
i want to have a baby .
let s talk about it later .
no . i want to have a baby . i have to have a baby .
i do not think we are ready .
you are not ready .
what ? !
i do not want to talk about this here .
you cannot fucking say something like that and say you do not want to talk about it !
clem , i am sorry . i should not have
oh , thank god . it is going .
so , um
you are drunk .
you do not tell me things , joel . i am an open book . i tell you everything . every damn embarrassing thing . you do not trust me .
no , it is not that .
i want to know you .
i just do not have anything very interesting about my life .
more ?
joely . . .
yeah , tangerine ?
do you know the velveteen rabbit ?
no .
such a beautiful view .
yes indeed . fuck ! they are erasing you , clem !
oh ?
i hired them to . we are in my brain . but i want it to stop , before i wake up and do not know you anymore .
wow . um , well . . . cannot you just force yourself awake ?
what if you hide me ?
what do you mean ?
i want my mommy . i do not want to lose you , clem .
i am right here .
i am scared . i want my mommy . i do not want to lose you . i do not want to lose . . .
you know , we are okay . they are not finding us . you will remember me in the morning . and you will come to me and tell me about us and we will start over .
you remember what happened next ?
i came over to the bed and you smelled so good , like you just woke up , slightly sweaty . and i climbed on the bed with you and you said something like
there s this guy !
what ?
there s this guy . i heard him talking in my apartment . he is one of the eraser guys . and he fell for you when they were erasing you , so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you are dating him .
really ? is he cute ?
he stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased !
but cannot you see . . . i love you , antoine .
do not call me antoine . my name is wally .
they found us before . the plan did not work . i do not know what to do now .
look at you , cutey ! what are we doing ?
joel !
happy birthday .
i scoured the city for it .
i am done , clem . i am just going to ride it out . hiding is clearly not working .
yeah .
i want to enjoy my little time left with you .
this is our first date date .
do you remember what we talked about ?
naomi , i guess .
yeah .
what was i wearing ?
god , i should know . your hair was red . i remember it matched the wallpaper .
egad , were you horrified ?
right . something black though .
i will buy that . black s always good .
we did talk about naomi .
i said are you sure ? you seem unsure .
i am sure , i said .
but you were not . i could tell .
i thought i was foolish . i thought i would mistaken infatuation for love . you said
so what . infatuation is good , too .
i dropped you off after . you said
come up and see me . . . now .
it is very late .
i told her today i need to end it .
is that what you want ?
i did not think you would show your face around me again . i figured you were humiliated . you did run away , after all .
sorry to track you down like this . i am not a stalker . but i needed to see you .
yeah ?
i would like to . . . take you out or something .
well , you are married .
not yet . not married .
look , man , i am telling you right off the bat , i am high maintenance . so i am not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there . if you want to be with me , you are with me .
okay .
joel , i am not a concept . i want you to just keep that in your head . too many guys think i am a concept or i complete them or i am going to make them alive , but i am just a fucked up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind . do not assign me yours .
i remember that speech really well .
i had you pegged , did not i ?
you had the whole human race pegged .
probably .
i still thought you were going to save me . even after that .
i know .
it would be different , if we could just give it another go around .
hi there .
you said . . .
i saw you sitting over here . by yourself . i thought , thank god , someone normal , who does not know how interact at these things either .
yeah . i do not ever know what to say .
i cannot tell you how happy i am to hear that . i mean , i do not mean i am happy you are uncomfortable , but , yknow . . . i am such a loser . every time i come to a party i tell myself i am going to be different and it is always exactly the same and then i hate myself after for being such a clod .
you know what i did .
yeah , i know . i am fishing .
i am clementine . can i borrow a piece of your chicken ?
oh god , how horrid .
you mean , like . . . oh , my darling , oh , my darling , oh , my darling , clementine . . . ? huckleberry hound ? that sort of thing ?
yeah , like that .
this is it , joel . it is gonna be gone soon .
i know .
what do we do ?
no , i stopped . i did not want to feel like i was being artificially modulated .
i know what you mean . that is why i stopped .
but my sleeping is really fucked up .
i do not think i have slept in a year .
you should try xanax . i mean , it is a chemical and all , but it works . . . and it works just having it around , knowing that it is there . like insurance .
yeah ?
i will give you a couple . see what you think .
okay .
have you ever read any anna akhmatova ?
i love her .
really ? me , too ! i do not meet people who even know who she is and i work in a book store .
i think she is great .
me too . there s this poem
did this conversation come before or after we saw the house ?
i think , before .
seems too coincidental that way .
do you know her poem that starts seaside gusts of wind , and a house in which we do not live . . .
yeah , yeah . it goes perhaps there is someone in this world to whom i could send all these lines ?
i wish we did . you married ?
um , no .
i do sort of live with somebody though .
male or female ?
female .
cool .
what are you doing ?
c mon , man . the water s fine . nobody s coming here tonight , believe me . this place is closed up . electricity s off .
i hesitated for what seemed like forever .
i knew .
i knew by your nervousness that naomi was not the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass .
it is dark .
yeah . that is your girlfriend s name ?
ah ha ! now i can look for candles , matches , and the liquor cabinet .
i think we should go .
so go .
i did . i walked out the door . i felt like i was a scared little kid . i thought you knew that about me . i ran back to the bonfire , trying to outrun my humiliation . you said , so go with such disdain .
what if you stay this time ?
i walked out the door . there s no more memory .
bye , joel .
so you will call me , right ?
yeah .
when ?
tomorrow ?
tonight . just to test out the phone lines .
do not worry . it is really solid this time of year .
i do not know . what if it breaks ?
i think i should go back .
listen , did you want to make love ?
make love ?
have sex . y know
oh , um . . .
because i just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now .
that is okay . i
i am sorry . i just wanted to say that . this seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and
hey , joel
and i am just too nervous around you right now .
i am nervous , too .
yeah ? i would not have thought that .
well , you obviously do not know me .
says you were closed off , non communicative , never told me what you were feeling .
says you were a bully . . .
a bully ? moi ?
that is what it says . you drank too much , you picked on me for being passive and timid .
well , sounds like me . sorry , man . says you were jealous and suspicious .
says you would sometimes disappear all night , then brag to me about your sexual conquests .
did i use the term sexual conquests or is that your way of putting it .
i do not know .
does not sound like me .
says you were a slob , leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake .
says you were constantly calling me a slob . it is sexy that we were like a married couple , griping and overly familiar and bored . do not you think ?
i sort of do . but i only see it as a fantasy version of reality . cleaned up enough to be erotic .
you are still excited by my irreverence . you have not yet started to think of it as my gratuitous need to shock .
i cannot stop thinking about you .
yay . meet me after work by the old mill .
what old mill ? is that somewhere we
what took you so long ?
i just walked in .
hmmm . do you miss me ?
oddly enough , i do .
ha ha ! you said , i do . i guess that means we are married .
i guess so .
yeah ?
did you send this ? is it a joke ?
i probably got the same thing as you .
i mean , i have not even told anyone i have met you . who would even know to do this ?
maybe it is true then . it is my voice on the tape .
it is true .
look , i have to go . i have to think .
hi , it is joel .
hey , lover . whatcha doing ?
i am just , y know , passing the time best i can till i can see you .
god , i cannot believe i ever hated you .
you must have been crazy .
guess what i am wearing .
i do not know . panties and
your dried cum .
hi , naomi , it is joel .
hi .
how is it going ?
good . i called you at work today . they said you were home sick .
i know . i had to take the day to think .
yeah , i tried you at home . did you get my message ?
i just got in .
that is me .
it was snowing .
the driver waved . so casual , friendly .
i might be making a mistake .
maybe i am making a mistake . maybe i just need to learn to live with this . first of all , i will get over it . secondly , it happened . those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it . who said that ? churchill ? i am not sure . but i do not care . she did it to me . i have to rid myself of this . fuck her .
pink . there was a number on it . i remember . al ? i have to follow through with this . i have no choice .
it is them .
i should maybe talk to you .
i love you and if you knew that . . . if i told you what happened . . . i will explain everything , what we meant to each other . i will tell you everything about our time together . you will know everything again and . . .
clementine .
gotta get home . how could she do this to me ? how could she not care about what we meant to each other . what a fuck ! what a fucking monster she is !
so then she just stops calling .
i was not going to call her . not after the way she was .
right ! she called me an old lady here , too ! and i remember , i said . . .
how is the chicken ?
she is so sexy .
i cannot . i have to go home . i will do it later .
naomi .
okay . i wish you could come .
your back to me . in that orange sweatshirt i would come to know so well and even hate eventually . at the time i thought , how cool , an orange sweatshirt .
i remember being drawn to you even then . i thought , i love this woman because she is alone down there looking out at the black ocean .
so you are still on the zoloft ?
clementine .
i really should go . i really need to catch my ride .
we will start with your most recent memories and go backwards there is an emotional core to each of our memories as we eradicate this core , it starts its degradation process by the time you wake up in the morning , all memories we have targeted will have withered and disappeared . like a dream upon waking .
is there any sort of risk of brain damage ?
i am sorry you saw one of our notification cards . you never should have .
well . . . i did .
we can help you through this . why do not you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with clementine .
we can help you through this . why do not you start now by telling me everything you can remember about
you have to stop this !
what ? what do you mean ?
i am trapped in my head and everything i love is being erased ! stop it now !
yours ?
naomi , i really value our relationship . i hope it is possible for us to stay in touch .
so that is going on , joel ?
i do not know , i have just been thinking , maybe we are not happy with each other .
what ?
y know , we have been , i do not know , sort of , unhappy with each other and
do not say we when you mean you .
i think maybe , we are both so used to operating at this level that how can one person be unhappy ? if one person is unhappy , both have to be . . . by definition .
bullshit . who is it ? you met someone .
no . i just need some space , maybe .
the thing is , joel , whatever it is you think you have with this chick , once the thrill wears off , you are just going to be joel with the same fucking problems .
hi .
hi .
how was it ?
you did not miss much . rob and carrie say hello .
hi , rob and carrie .
yeah . come to bed . i am cold .
so you do not mind ?
say hi to rob and carrie . have some fun !
i hope you get your work done .
so . . . you have not been involved with anyone in all this time ?
it is been a pretty lonely couple of years .
i am sorry .
well , it was my fault the break up . i am sorry .
oh , sweetie . it really does cut both ways . we were taking each other for granted and
i miss you .
miss you , too . i have been seeing someone for a little while .
oh ! great . that is great !
a religion instructor at columbia . a good guy . he is a good guy .
i am sorry . i really should not have
so you think the dissertation will get published ?
okay , joel . i suppose you are right .
i had a good time last night . i really did .
so i am going to get some sleep . i am glad you are okay .
we will speak soon .
oh , hey , patrick .
oh , patrick , you did not want any , did you ?
i love quotes . so did winston churchill . he actually has a quotation in bartlett s about bartlett s . is not that trippy ?
yeah . cool .
the quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts .
very cool . trippy .
definitely !
boo .
stan . . . c mon . . .
sorry . i just
it is just . . . y know . . . i mean . . .
i know . anyway
see you later , alligator .
kay .
hey , if you are ordering lunch for mierzwiak , would you
it is freezing out .
you found us okay ?
yeah . poor guy . have anything to drink ?
we have not checked .
nietzsche . beyond good and evil . found it my bartletts .
that is a good one .
yeah , i cannot wait to tell howard ! it seems really appropriate .
yup .
do not you think howard s like that ? smart ? important ?
let him go , stan . i can help .
it is amazing , is not it ? such a gift howard gave the world .
yeah .
to let people begin again . it is beautiful . you look at a baby and it is so fresh , so clean , so free . and adults . . . they are like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness . . . hopelessness . and howard just makes it go away .
it is stopped .
what ?
it is not erasing . he is off the screen .
where ?
i do not know what to do ! i do not know what to do ! crap . crap . . .
well , what should we do ?
i do not know ! i just said that !
sor ry we have to do something . he cannot wake up half done .
no way . i can handle this .
he is coming ?
you better go .
hey .
do you swear you did not know ?
i swear .
and you never even suspected ? never saw us behaving in any unusual way together ?
it was here . at his car . i was coming back from a job and spotted you together . you seemed caught . i waved . you giggled .
how did i look ?
and after that ?
i really like you , mary . you know that .
do you remember anything else ? what i was wearing ? was i standing close to him ? was i leaning against his car like i owned it ? how did he look at me when i giggled ? tell me everything .
you were in red . that red sweater with the little flowers , i think . you were leaning against his car . he looked a little like a kid . kind of goofy and wide eyed . i would never seen him look like that before . happy . you looked beautiful . you looked in love .
oh .
hi .
what do you want , stan ?
that is this ?
nothing .
i know what it is .
then why did you ask me ?
i do not know . i just there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office .
mary , people come to him voluntarily .
i will not allow it . those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it . what do you think of that ? that is from my quote book .
the office is filled with people who want their memories re erased .
remember the alamo ! remember the alamo !
howard , your one o clock .
mary . . .
yes ?
order me a pastrami for after ?
cole slaw , ice tea ?
thanks .
okay , we are back in .
that was beautiful to watch , howard . like a surgeon or a concert pianist .
do you like quotes , howard ?
how do you mean ?
oh , um , like famous quotes . i find reading them inspirational to me . and in my reading i have come across some i thought you might like , too .
okay , um , there s one that goes blessed are the forgetful , for they get the better even of their blunders .
is that nietzsche ?
yeah , yeah it is , howard . and here i was thinking i could tell you something you did not know .
there s another one i like , i read . it is by pope alexander .
alexander pope ?
yes , shit . oops , sorry ! sorry . it is just i told myself i was not going to say pope alexander and sound like a dope and then i go ahead and do it . like i psyched myself out .
it is no big deal .
that is lovely .
really ? i thought it was appropriate maybe . that is all . i really admire the work that you do . i know it is not proper to be so familiar but i guess since we are outside the workplace i feel a certain liberty to
it is fine , mary . i am happy to hear it .
i have loved you for a very long time . i am sorry ! i should not have said that .
i have got a wife , mary . kids . you know that .
we cannot do this .
what , howard ?
thanks . so . . . do we talk about this . . . or what ?
i do not know what i am supposed say , mary . i want to do the right thing here .
do you love me ? did you love me ? something . i listened to my tape . i cannot believe i have been sitting right in front of it for a year . it is like listening to someone else s story . i mean , i hear myself talking about having sex with you and i cannot even imagine you naked . i cannot even say naked to you !
i have a family , mary .
you made me have an abortion .
it was a mutual decision .
you made me have you erased ! i loved you . i love you ! how could you
stan ? that is going on ?
the guy we are doing ? he is disappeared from the map . i cannot find him anywhere .
okay , what happened right before he disappeared ?
i was away from the monitor for a second . i had it on automatic . i had to go pee .
well , where was patrick ?
he went home sick .
jesus . all right , that is the address .
ah , your journal . this will be invaluable .
mary . what are you doing here ?
i tried that already .
did you try going through c gate ?
you get some sleep , howard . i will take it from here .
howard , they have disappeared again .
i will go out for a smoke . if no one minds .
so , i have got to drop the van off .
she should not have done this , stan . as mad as she was . . . as justifiably
i do not know what you are talking about , howard .
mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people .
oh , hi .
hi , i was in the neighborhood and thought i would see
i think he is in a conference . unfortunately . i am really sorry .
would you just try him ? you never know . as long as i am here . you never know .
this book it is essential that people read it because it is the truth . and only i know it .
the voltage looks fine .
does that help ?
it is an apartment .
not a dump , then , but kind of plain . uninspired . and there s a stale smell . sort of stuffy . i do not know . stuffy .
patrick , let s just get through this . we have a long night ahead of us .
yeah ?
just wanted to let you know .
i like mary . i like when she comes to visit . i just do not think she likes me .
she likes you okay .
i wonder if i should invite my girlfriend over , too . i have a girlfriend now .
you can if you want .
did i tell you i have a new girlfriend ?
this one s history . moving on . . .
the thing is . . . my situation is a little weird . my girlfriend situation .
i gotta tell you something . i kind of fell in love with her last night .
she was unconscious , patrick .
she was beautiful . so sweet and funky and voluptuous . i kind of stole a pair of her panties , is what .
mary hates me . i have never been popular with the ladies .
maybe if you stopped stealing their panties .
that is your bartlett s ?
hold on . let me ask my friend . stan , can i leave for a little while ? my girlfriend is very
patrick , we are in the middle of
i can handle it . he is pretty much on auto pilot anyway .
i am a friend of bonanza jellybeangs .
i know who you are .
oh ? well , there s been some trouble on the ranch . i came up here to get out of the way . it is so dark now i doubt if i could find my way back down . if you could help . . .
but i do not know how to polka .
what was that ?
clockworks .
the clockworks is one reason that i am here on siwash ridge . i accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the clock people .
siwash , huh ?
but unlike the clockworks of the clock people , my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe . . . . . . . . . . ha ha ho ho and hee hee .
during the second world war i busted out of tule lake detention camp as a japanese american , i had been put there and watched over . i found refuge with the clock people , who discovered me in a snow bank , near dead , i had been climbing across the sierra nevada mountains .
then if you are japanese , then why are you called the chink ?
what do you believe in then ?
is everything getting worse ?
yes , everything is getting worse . but everything is also getting better .
i want to go back to the clock people . i kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they are up to . that is happened to jelly ?
she had a one way ticket to kansas city .
but that is an old story now . . . . . . i cannot believe that you would leave the butte .
well , if the clock people give you any inside information on the end of the world , drop us a postcard .
suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics . all in siwash cave . in a postcatastrophe world , your offspring would of necessity intermarry , forming in time a tribe . a tribe every member of which had giant thumbs . a tribe of big thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways . it could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools . it would have to rely on its wits and its senses . it would have to live with animals and plants ! as virtual equals . it is extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants , learning their languages , perhaps , and paying them the respect they deserve .
how am i going to be the progenitor of a tribe when i am living on an isolated ridgetop with delores ?
where do you live , miss hankshaw ?
i am staying with the countess .
i know , but where do you reside when you are not visiting new york ?
i do not .
you do not ?
a traveler , eh ?
where are the others ?
welcome , podner . by god , it is great to have you here . it is an honor . sorry i took so long getting to you , but we have had a mess of hard work these past few days and a heap of planning to do .
er , you seem to know who i am , and maybe even what i am . thanks for the breakfast .
no , i am afraid that part is not true . jack was in awe of me and tracked me down . we spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field , but he was hardly my lover . besides , i always travel alone .
tell me about it .
about . . .
about being a cowgirl . that is it all about ? when you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl .
you are political , then ?
did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth ? it is not original . it is something i picked up from the chink .
really ? the chink , huh ? i have gathered that you sometimes speak with him . what else have you learned from the chink ?
. . . . . . delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week , but so far her third vision has not happened . niwetkame , the mother goddess has not gotten back in touch with her . meanwhile she and debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools . tension . cowgirl tension ! what a drag .
what is debbie s position ?
debbie says that if women are to take charge again , they must do it in the feminine way they must not resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods . she says it is up to women to show themselves better than men , to love men , set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the new age . she is a real dreamer , that debbie dear .
you do not agree with debbie , then ?
that is jellybean !
looks like every time we get together things are in a mess .
so be it . it looks serious this time , though . all these guns . . . are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes ?
hell no , the cranes are wonderful , okay , but i am not in this for whooping cranes . i am in it for cowgirls . if we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue , then cowgirls become just another compromise . i want a finer fate than that for me and for every other cowgirl . better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised .
no , i guess not .
wouldrugged is a stupid word .
every time i tell you that i love you , you flinch . but that is your problem .
extraordinary !
she is obviously that . jesus ! which would you rather have , a million dollars or one of sissy s thumbs full of pennies ?
oh , you ! i am not talking about her hands . they are difficult to ignore , i confess , but i am speaking of her whole being . her whole being is extraordinary . the way she talks , for example . she is so articulate .
it is high time you realized , honey babe , that a woman does not have to give the best years of her life to radcliffe or smith in order to speak the english language .
countess . i am really in a dither . she is turned my head .
ninety degrees to the left , i hope . how does she feel about you ?
i think she is disappointed that i am not more , ah , sort of atavistic . she is got some naive , sentimental notions about indians . i am sure she liked me , though but . . . . then she left town .
how does she like what in bed ?
what do you think ?
well . . . . er . . .
shit o dear , julian . do you mean to tell me you did not get it on ?
oh , we did not get it all the way on .
whose fault was that ?
i suppose it was mine . yes , it definitely was my fault .
what do they do to you boys in those ivy league schools , anyway ? strap you down and pump the nature out of you ? they can even press the last drop of nature out of a mohawk buck . why , send a shaman or cannibal to yale for four years and all he would be fit for would be a desk in the military industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a neil simon comedy . jesus h . m . s . christ ! if harvard or princeton could get hold of the chink for a couple of semesters they would turn him into a candidate for the bow tie wing of the hall of wimps . oogie boogie .
if we ivy leaguers are not earthy enough to suit you hillbillies , at least we do not go around indulging in racist terms such as chink . next thing i know , you will be calling me chief .
chink s the guy s name , for christ s sake .
what guy ?
i am cold .
here . i will turn down the air conditioner .
what are you doing ?
getting dressed . i have got to go .
but i do not want you to leave . please stay . we can go to dinner . i owe you a dinner . and tonight . . . we can . . . really make love .
i have to go , julian .
why ? why do you have to go ?
going north ?
thanks .
are you in show business ?
i was a successful model once .
for magazines ?
i was the yoni yum feminine hygiene dew girl from to , but got laid off .
so now you are bumming around ?
yep .
hitchhiking ?
i am the best .
you are the best ?
when i was younger , i hitchhiked one hundred and twenty seven hours without stopping , without food or sleep , crossed the continent twice in six days , cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways .
whooee !
to my own special sissy . cheers ! and welcome . so my letter brought ya flying , eh ? where were you ? salt lake city ? la conner ? well , i may have a little surprise for you . but first , tell me about yourself . it is been six months , has not it ? in some circles that is half a year . how are you ?
tired . . .
that is the very first time in the eons that i have known you that i have ever heard you complain . and now you are tired , poor darling .
a born freak can only go uphill .
freak , schmeek . most of us are freaks in one way or another . try being born a male russian countess into a white middle class baptist family in mississippi and you will see what i mean .
i have always been proud of the way nature singled me out . it is the people who have been deformed by society i feel sorry for . i have been steady moving for eleven years and some months . maybe i should rest up for a spell , i am not as young as i used to be .
shit o goodness , you will not be thirty for another year , and you are more beautiful than ever .
you were the yoni yum girl from , let s see , from nineteen sixty eight through nineteen seventy . you have always smelled so nice . like a little sister . the irony has just killed me . you , the dew girl , one of the few girls who does not need dew . i loath the stink of females ! they are so sweet the way god made them , then they start fooling around with men and soon they are stinking . like rotten mushrooms , like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool , like a tuna fish s retirement party . they all stink . from the queen of england to bonanza jellybean , they stink .
bonanza jellybean ?
she is a young thing who works on my ranch . real name is sally jones or something wooden like that . she is cute as a hot fudge taco , and , of course , it takes verve to change one s name so charmingly . but she stinks like a slut just the same .
your ranch ?
sissy , sissy , blushing bride , you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways . the countess has arranged a job for you . and what a job . . .
a job for me ?
the food and drug administration said wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters , burns and rashes . although the fda judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market , they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings .
if you do not want me to pose for him , why do you want me to meet him ?
purely personal . i believe you might enjoy one another .
but countess . . .
but here you are , still a virgin you are virginal yet , are not you ?
why , yes , technically . jack kerouac and i came awfully close , but he was afraid of me , i think . . .
yes , well , what i am getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity . she cannot wait too long , you know . now , there s no reason why you must lose yours . i mean , just ponder it a bit , that is all .
what makes you think this watercolorist and i would develop a romantic relationship ?
i cannot be certain that you would . but what have you got to lose ?
well , okay . i will try it . i do not see the point in it , but i will try it . just for you . it is kind of silly , actually , me going out with an artist in new york city . however . . .
sissy , do not play dumb with me ! you are a good model but a shitty actress . the cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance . you know perfectly well they are . last seen in nebraska . did not make it to canada . siwash lake is between nebraska and canada . the cowgirls have possession of siwash lake . and who else but jellybeangs wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds ? how much do you know about it ? have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows ?
i do not know anything about it .
ballast .
that means top secret , cooper .
i can see why they sent you along .
you still need the rope ? i thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins .
. . . do you copy ?
uh , yeah coop , i am still here .
shit ! do not do that ! where the fuck are you ?
holy shit . . .
justin ?
time to play spam in the can .
okay , listen up . as you all know by now , we have an addition to our crew . dr . weir , this is starck , navigation smith , pilot , justin , ship s engineer
you can call him baby bear , he loves that . . .
. . . cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission . . . !
from what ?
. . . come on , skipper , i already put my shoes on . . .
you have had plenty eva , coop , it is justings turn . stay on station . if anything happens . . .
we have a man down . . .
coop , where are you . . .
the containment , second containment . . .
but justin . . .
captain miller , we are ready to repressurize the clark .
. . . and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before .
you prep the gravity couches . i am going to manually arm those explosives .
will it work ?
you been out there a long time . trying to break my record ?
i would rather spend the next twelve hours outside than another five minutes in this can . this ship is bad . it watches you .
what ?
you heard me . this ship , it is crazy trying to go faster n light , that is like the tower of babel .
shit , smith , you are going biblical on me .
you know what happened to the tower of babel , do not you ? it fell down .
we will have to re route through the port conduit to the apu .
it is holding . . . she is holding . . . !
solid as a rock . hey , smith . . .
smith , clear that airlock , man , i am coming in .
damn , dr . weir , do not scare us like that . coffee ?
what ?
coffee .
the event horizon only had life support for eighteen months . it seems impossible , but in light of the transmission . . . i have to think that someone has managed to endure until now .
it was like . . . nothing was there . . . and then justin appeared and the core . . . became metal . . .
no , he did not .
you were not there . i saw it .
i do not know what happened to justin .
i am telling you , i saw it . . .
what you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion .
is that an offer ?
that is happening ?
let me breathe , let me breathe . . .
how ? the bridge is gone .
there must be a way ! what about engineering ?
can you shut it down ?
i do not know the process , dr . weir was the expert . . .
i am gonna activate the emergency beacon .
what . . . ?
he is a rescue technician . peters , medical technician . dj . . .
trauma .
we have not tested the air yet . it could be contaminated . . .
how is he ?
carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations , impaired judgement . . .
to conserve our oxygen , we should severely restrict our activity . anyone who can should get some sleep .
he will live . . . if we ever make it back .
of course not . justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it . just one of those things . i swore i would never lose another man . i came close today . real close .
i , i tried to go back for him , to save him , but i could not get to him in time . the fire . . . have you ever seen fire in zero gravity ? it is like a liquid , it slides over everything . it was like a wave breaking over him , a wave of fire . and then he was gone . i never told anyone until now . but this ship knew , dj . it knows about the goliath , it knows about corrick . it knows our secrets . it knows what we are afraid of . and now you are going to tell me it is carbon dioxide .
what is it ?
i have been listening to the transmission . and i think houston made a mistake in the translation .
they thought it said , liberatis me , save me , but it is not me . it is tutemet save yourself .
it is not a distress call . it is a warning .
do you hear it ? right there .
hear what ?
it sounds like ex infera ex , from infera , the ablative case of inferi . hell .
save yourself . from hell . what are you saying , are you saying that this ship is possessed ?
dj . the clark s gone . smith and cooper are dead .
what happened ?
please . . .
oh , god , dj , what do i . . . how do i . . .
please . . . kill . . .
that is wrong ?
that is happening . . . ?
that is wrong ?
i have got a pulse , he is alive . . .
pressure ?
over and falling . . . .
intubate , pure oxygen feed , get the nitrogen out of his blood . . .
his peritoneum has ruptured . . .
you wanted to see me , admiral ?
incredible . . . these are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared . . . this , this happened ? this is not some kind of hoax ?
i would not bring you here on a hoax . houston confirms the telemetry and i . d . codes .
that ship was lost in deep space , seven years ago . if the titanic sailed into new york harbor , i would find it more plausible . houston wants aerospace to send out a search and rescue team , investigate the source of the transmission . if it really is the event horizon , they will attempt a salvage . we need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship s systems for the salvage crew . . .
it is against my better judgement , but i will run this by the man downstairs . you will know my decision by the end of the day .
thank you .
it is not that simple . lyle , play the recording for dr . weir .
you are not seriously considering sending him ?
you do not just dismiss bill weir . the man held oppenheimer s chair at princeton . if the event horizon had worked , he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since einstein .
the official inquiry blamed weir s design for the ship s loss .
that does not mean a damn thing . they were looking for a scapegoat and weir fit the bill . but he is not responsible for what happened to the ship .
does he know that ?
that is on your mind ?
he does not belong on this mission . responsible or not , he blames himself . he is too close to it . and then there s his wife .
it is been two years since she died . he is over it .
i want our best people on this . where is miller ?
what , justin , what shows you ?
it will not stop , it goes on and on and on . . .
what does ?
. . . it is inside and it eats and eats until there s nothing left .
the dark inside . . . ? i do not understand .
oh my god oh my god . . .
. . . is zero . that is what the singularity does it folds space , so that point a and point b coexist in the same space and time . after the ship passes through this gateway , space returns to normal . it is called a gravity drive .
how do you know all this ?
you have reached the first containment seal . the engineering decks are on the other side .
we still have pressure . the radiation count s steady at millirads an hour .
i have reached another containment door . this thing s huge . . .
that is the second containment seal . beyond that , engineering .
everything green on my boards , skipper .
okay . we do it the hard way . deck by deck , room by room . starck , deploy the umbilicus . i believe you are up for a walk , mr . justin . go get your bonnet on .
justin , finish your sweep .
patch me through to him .
justin .
. . . i do not want to die . . . !
you are not going to die ! not today ! i want you to do exactly as i say and i am gonna get you out of there , alright ?
but i cannot . . . i gotta get out of here . . . skipper , please . . .
this is weir .
dr . weir , you have no experience with salvage procedures .
i designed the ship s propulsion system . i am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive . you cannot send a search and rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed . that would be like . . . like sending an auto mechanic to work on the shuttle .
i can understand your desire to redeem your reputation , dr . weir , but it does not factor into this .
since the initial transmission , there s been no further contact . just the beacon , every two minutes .
the crew ? could they still be alive ?
the ship had life support systems for eighteen months . they are been gone seven years .
that is the hold up ?
just loading the last of the co scrubbers . good for four months .
i put in for a replacement for you but no one . . .
no , no , its alright . i talked to my ex , he will keep denny over christmas and i will get him this summer . goddam it , skipper . . . i have not seen him in two months .
we have got pressure .
jesus its huge .
that means they did not abandon ship .
peters is right , no one s here .
i can see the hatch .
the blood came from somewhere , peters . . .
okay . i am on the bridge .
everything s been shut down . conserving power , i guess . green light on the hull , it is intact .
i found one .
alive ?
justin , check the containment for radiation leaks . peters . . .
. . . how is the client ?
can anybody hear me . . .
skipper . . .
peters . . .
. . . you okay ?
peters , i want you to go through the ship s log , see if we cannot find some answers .
i can use the station in medical , keep an eye on justin . . .
i can run the image through a series of filters , try to clean it up .
that is a negative , starck .
peters . we need to know what happened to the crew . before it happens to us .
i will get back to the log . but on the bridge , i will not go back , back in there . . .
captain miller , i just want to say . . .
captain miller , i appreciate this opportunity . . .
doctor weir , my crew is not going on your mission because we want to . we were pulled off a well deserved leave , to be sent out to the middle of nowhere , and no one s even told us why .
i have been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach neptune space .
it was the ship s maiden voyage , to test the drive . the event horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters . they received the go ahead to activate the gravity drive . and the ship vanished from all our scopes . no radar contact , no enhanced optical , no radio contact of any kind . they disappeared without a trace . until now .
where has it been for the last seven years ?
what does it say ?
that is the engineering containment . and there s the main airlock . we can dock there .
smith , use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster .
dr . weir , i need you on the bridge .
captain , i did not come out here to sit on your bridge , i need to be on that ship . . .
once the ship is secured , we will bring you on board
that is not acceptable
you are in the central corridor . it connects the personnel areas to engineering .
i can see that , what are they for ?
easy , peters , we are okay , we are okay . let s finish the sweep .
any survivors ?
no one ?
it beats dying , mister smith .
yes .
hold on , that is this gravitational distortion ?
it is possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the core , distorting space time . they could be what hit the lewis and clark .
what could cause them ? that is in the core ?
it is complicated . . .
it is insane .
insane ? the finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship . it would take the lewis and clark a thousand years to reach our closest star . the event horizon could be there in a day . . .
if it worked .
i want this room sealed . the second containment is off limits .
there s no danger . the black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields , it is under control .
you have something , dr . weir ?
the date .
what about it ?
the event horizongs computer think s it is .
it is . . .
explanation ?
what the hell is that ? dr . weir ?
we barely have enough power for life support as it is , if we cannot stop the drain , we are not gonna make it .
we do not get the power back , our air s gonna go bad .
we are a long way from home and we are in a bad place . let s not make it worse . if anyone has any constructive suggestions , now is the time .
i think i can stabilize the fields around the singularity , that should prevent another power drain .
is that your expert opinion ? the only answer we have had out of you is i do not know .
i want to know what caused that noise . i want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock .
thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly , causing reverberations
that is bullshit and you know it ! you built this fucking ship and all i have heard from you is bullshit !
what do you want me to say ?
you said this ship creates a gateway . . .
yes . . .
to what ? where did this ship go ? where did you send it ?
i do not know . . .
where has it been for the past seven years ?
i do not know . . .
the other place , what is that . . . ?
i do not know ! i do not know . there s a lot of things going on here that i do not understand . truth takes time .
we are leaving .
you cannot , your orders are specific . . .
. . . to rescue the crew and salvage the ship . the crew is dead , dr . weir . this ship killed them . and now it is killing us .
you are insane . you have lost your mind .
maybe you are right . but it is still my command , and i have leeway to abort when i feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew . and i think there is . starck , download all the files from the event horizongs computers . coop , smith , finish moving the co scrubbers back onto the clark .
do not . . . do not do this . . .
what about my ship ?
we will take the lewis and clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the event horizon until i am satisfied that she has been destroyed . fuck this ship .
you . . . you cannot do that !
you cannot leave . she will not let you .
i told you . . . she will not let you leave . . .
your eyes . . .
i do not need them anymore . where we are going , we will not need eyes to see .
what are you talking about ?
if you miss me , you will blow out the hull . you will die too .
weir is dead .
then who the fuck are you ?
what are you ?
you know .
you want me to believe you are the devil , well , i do not , that is bullshit !
i am not the devil .
then what , what are you ? tell me . . .
there is no devil . there is no god . there is only . . . nothing .
you are lying . . . !
i am not asking you to believe me . you will see for yourself . . . and so will your crew . you are all coming with me .
you cannot have them . go to hell .
i do not like it either , but you know the rules we get the call , we go . is the course locked in ?
jesus . . .
heading three three four . . .
. . . make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees . . .
we have a lock on the event horizongs navigation beacon . it is in the upper ionosphere , we are in for some chop .
we are all on edge , smith . we are a long way out . . .
that is not it . that ship was built to go faster than light . . . that is just wrong , it goes against everything we know . . .
what are you trying to say ? if god had intended man to fly , he would have given us wings ?
i guess we are about to find out . keep us slow and steady .
yes , sir .
we have got some weather .
meters . we are getting too close . . .
proximity warning ! , meters , . . . we are right on top of it , we are gonna hit !
put it through tacs . smith , you up for a flyby ?
it is now . we are locked in .
captain miller . . .
smith , where the hell have you been ? !
do we have enough time for a weld ?
we do not have time to fart .
we are losing pressure at liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked . in three minutes , our atmosphere will be gone . we are fucking dead .
no one s dying on my watch , smith ! what about the reserve tanks ?
but . . .
captain miller , you copy ?
i am here , smith , how is the clark ?
i have found a six inch fracture in the outer hull . we should be able to repair it and re pressurize , it is gonna take some time .
we do not have time , smith . in twenty hours we run out of air .
. . . you break all the laws of physics , you think there will not be a price ? you already killed the first crew . . .
sir .
thank you .
captain , we got a problem .
now what ?
she was right behind me , i turn around , she is gone . she could be anywhere .
skipper . . .
what is it , smith ?
smith , get out of there . . .
come again , skipper ?
get off the clark now and wait for me at the airlock .
no , no , we just got her back together . . .
where is it , where is it . . .
we are past the outer marker , we can engage the ion drive whenever you are ready .
ion drive will engage in . . . t minus ten minutes .
starck , why are not you on the bridge ?
i just finished drying . . .
crossing the horizon . optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees .
something s wrong with the bio scan .
radiation interference ?
that is an affirmative .
everybody okay ?
we are all here .
it tastes bad .
the antennae array s completely fried , we have got no radio , no laser , no highgain . . . no one s going to be coming to help us .
how much oh two do we have ?
oxygen is not the problem .
carbon dioxide ?
it is building up with every breath we take . and the co filters on the event horizon are shot .
we can take the filters from the clark . . .
i thought of that , with the filters from the clark , we have got enough breathable air for twenty hours . after that , we would better be on our way home .
what about the life readings you picked up ?
the event horizon sensors show the same thing bio readings of indeterminate origin . right before that wave hit the clark , there was some kind of surge , right off the scale , but now it is back to its previous levels .
that is causing the readings ?
i do not know , but whatever it is , it is not the crew .
that is the point ? i will just get the same thing . . .
not acceptable . i want to know that is causing those readings . if the crew is dead , i want the bodies , i want the crew found .
i can reconfigure the scan for c , amylase proteins .
maybe one of the original crew ?
no . it was someone else .
who ?
miller . . .
what is it , starck ?
. . . i ran the bio scan with the dna rna filter . the results were bio readings of indeterminate origin . . .
. . . bio readings of indeterminate origin , do not you have anything useful to tell me ?
go ahead .
you have got to listen . . .
to what ? what are you saying ? this ship is alive ?
i did not say that , i said the bio readings correspond to what happened to you , the ship is reacting to us . . .
it is not bullshit , it is the only conclusion the data supports . . .
starck , do you know how crazy that sounds ? it is impossible .
if you knew it was impossible , then why would you waste my time ?
what i want is to survive the next ten hours .
nine hours and twenty two minutes .
miller , come in . . .
that is going on in there , starck ?
what ?
he is awake , he is in the airlock , he is not wearing a suit .
i am on my way , starck .
tuck yourself into a crouched position , shut your eyes as tight as you can !
weir cannot be alive .
weir activated the drive . he is sending us to the other place .
blow the fucker up .
blow it up ?
i will do it
we are armed . this fucker s ready to blow . . .
. . . repeat , we are armed . . .
weir .
first time in a grav couch ?
do not worry about it . he is hard , but he is fair . you are lucky to be shipping out with him . he is one of the few captains in the service with experience in the outer reach .
he is been past mars ?
he served on the goliath .
was not that ship destroyed ?
claire . . .
here s another one . they are all over the place .
dr . weir , that is this the door to ?
yes , we can see some kind of mist . what is that ?
blood . looks like arterial spray .
can you see a body ?
no . i saw nothing .
about an hour ago . in medical . i saw my son . he was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were . . .
is not it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge ?
there s no one in the corridor but us .
he is engaged the override .
yes . yes , justin , we heard it .
keep him talking .
almost got it .
we have to do something , oh god . . .
you got any coffee ?
it is cold .
hey . . .
where is she ?
jesus , that is one big ugly fat fucker . . .
foredecks . crew quarters , bridge , medical and science labs , hydroponics , what have you . that central section connects the forward decks to the engineering containment area . can we move in closer ?
what the hell is that ?
the safety circuit is failed !
what ?
i did not see anything and i do not have to see anything . this ship is fucked .
thank you for that scientific analysis , mister smith .
i cannot believe this , i have not gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit . why not mars , cap , mars has women . . .
hours to neptune orbit .
you cannot do that .
this is u . s . aerospace command vessel lewis and clark , hailing event horizon , event horizon , do you read . . . ? this is the lewis and clark , hailing . . .
if they are , they are screening their calls .
the scope is lit , it is right in front of us . . .
range meters and holding . turbulence is dropping off . . .
what happened to his eyes ?
explosive decompression .
miller , do you read me , peters
get them back
what if the air has gone bad ? we cannot wear these suits forever .
relativity , yes . we cannot break the law of relativity , but we can go around it . the ship does not really move faster than the speed of light it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously jump from one point in the universe to another , light years away .
how ?
a straight line .
the reactor s still hot . we have got several small radiation sources , leaks probably . nothing serious .
do they have pressure ?
could it be the crew ? if they were in suspended animation , would not that effect the scan ?
what is it ?
what is it ?
that is how the gravity drive works , you see it focuses the black hole s immense gravitational power to create the gateway . that is how the event horizon travels faster than light .
why dr . weir , i think you are in love .
hmmm . claire used to tell me i loved the event horizon more than i loved her . i told her that was not true , i just knew the event horizon better , that is all .
claire is your wife ?
yes .
it must be hard , being so far away from her .
yes . i miss her . she died . two years now .
maybe a power interruption crashed the system . . .
what are you doing ?
in our current environment , dr . weir , self control is an asset .
what is it ?
the forward airlock .
justin said something about , the dark inside me . . . what did he mean ?
i do not think she is real big on hate .
such a sad face . . . you know , sometimes being different is not a bad thing .
how would you know it was me ?
i am not really dressed for a party .
relax , it is casual .
those yours too ?
we are going to have to work on your touch .
you know , you could a run an ad in the personals .
sensual blind chick seeks three ton , rock hard he man for deep spiritual relationship .
you do not know what it is like out there . walking around like some kind of circus freak . people staring , whispering
i would not know anything about that .
i mean . . .
way to not overthink it . so when do we leave ?
i can handle the ship . i can even handle mr . blonde ambition . but i do not know if i should be flying or playing vegas in these suits . who the hell came up with them ?
we can monitor the cloud s approach and observe the tests from here .
i can only stay for one drink , ben . i have got to meet with victor .
we need to give you a physical , so we know what got zapped .
you look like an eighties rock band .
the suit will stretch . you should try it
he did not .
oh , he did .
he did not mean it . you know johnny . he is always been a hothead
it is not him . it is them . i cannot live like this .
just give reed a little more time . you know how he works analyzing every little step before he takes one
it is easy for you to be patient .
where is reed ?
what are you doing here ?
i am worried about you .
about me ? how sweet .
ben , come in .
what is this ? where is reed ?
what do you want , vic ?
reed said it would be weeks till
he could not generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass . yet another mistake for mr . fantastic .
i will be watching over you .
soon as i am back , i am gonna trade that in for a bigger rock .
deb . . . it is me . i need you to step out front .
ben ?
do not come any closer for a sec . this is gonna be kind of a shock . . . you remember when we said together forever no matter what ?
oh my g g g . what did you . . . do to ben ?
what did you wish for , honey ?
good thing it ai not workin . . . reed , what are we doing here ? this guy s fast food , strip mall science
he is financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century .
i cannot take this .
what about his first born ?
he knew about nasa . what if he made the call to shut us down
ben , think about all the people we can help if this works
maybe you should think about yourself for once . you always let this guy push you round
we got what we wanted . that is enough .
cannot do it . i cannot do it .
external srbs , orbital system engines . its just like the shuttles you flew in
no . i cannot take orders from that underwear model . that wingnut washed out of nasa for sneaking two victoria secret wannabes into a flight simulator .
they crashed it into a wall . a flight simulator .
when have i asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do ?
five times .
i had it at four .
is not that your speech ?
he is made a few changes .
this is your dream , reed . you should be the one up there .
the shields on the station should protect us .
i ai not done arranging your flowers , egghead .
how long was i out ?
three days . i was worried about you . how are you feeling ?
i do not know . i just keep going over and over the numbers .
reed . even you cannot compute every little thing .
you go through something like this , makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life .
yeah , you and debbie and perfect
what ? come on . she is got a good thing with victor
i am sorry , did that cosmic bath loosen your screws ?
he is smart , powerful , successful
are you alright ?
what the !
ben . are you okay ?
we had a tough year .
you got a chisel round here ?
okay . i have uh , got some questions , from sue . that she thought might be better coming from me . . . can you , you know , go to the bathroom . . . like normal . . .
yeah . you do not wanna know the details .
ben , i am afraid i have got to ask
not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your
it is about to be a broken face .
ben
oh , you remember my name do you ? you happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body ?
we are working as hard as we can
glad nothing could take you away from your work .
time for your lesson , vic . chem what happens when you supercool hot metal . . . ? ben . . .
ben , i have been crunching the numbers on the machine . i think if we can rework the power settings . . .
what the hell you smiling at ? just keep your mouth shut , and your mind on those smbs
if you behave , maybe next time daddy will let you drive .
please tell me your dawg s not trying to rekindle things with my sister .
course not . strictly business .
yeah , well , his eyes say different .
hey , two hearts got busted last time . maybe she is not over it either .
let s see you got victor , stud of the year , more coin than god ? or reed , the world s dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp . hmmm , it is a toss up .
put your tiny little mind at ease .
where . . . where am i ?
back on earth . victor s medical facility . . . we are in quarantine .
reed ? . . . sue ?
that is wrong with me ?
i swear to you they have done everything humanly possible . the best plastic surgeons in the world , ben . you had the best
they said that is not such a good idea , the shock alone could
hey ! that is a prototype !
the machine works . and vic s gone mister hyde on us
no more cracks about how i look .
your tissue , your organs , your entire biophysical structure is changing . every system is still functioning , somehow
and they are changing into . . .
i do not really know . a compound organic metallic alloy . stronger than titanium or carbon steel . harder than diamonds
like the shields reed said would protect us . how long ?
at this rate , the infection should be complete in two , maybe three weeks
what do you mean complete ?
what ?
but . . . this disease . . . is progressive . . . degenerative . . .
and where do we think we are going ?
you are hot !
so are you !
i mean , you feel a little feverish .
i have never felt better in my life . when do you get off work ?
my shift ends at four , but i could not
me like y .
stay right . left is trouble .
i though we went over this .
you are on fire !
not this again
victor s right . johnny , get to the command center . close the shields .
he is not responsive
now what is up with that ?
the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna .
oh , you dawg you . better not be my nurse !
this is wrong in so many ways .
ben grimm is a genuine american hero who s been through a terrible orde
twenty ? from outside the place looks a lot taller .
we should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes . . .
this place is deluxe . you got cable ?
back it down , johnny !
not only could you kill yourself , but you could set fire to earth s atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it .
is there something about flames ? about flaming , that you
what are you trying to say ? just because i dress well and like to dance
what ? no . i am trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms .
he is right . these costumes are . . . missing something . i cannot put my finger on it
that is what i am trying to calculate . and it is not rubber . it is muscle , tendon . i seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to
you need to control yourself and think before you
act . here we go again . reed , what if we got these gifts for a reason ? what if we have some , you know . . . like , calling ?
johnny . supernova .
but all these people . . .
the synthetics act as a second skin , adapting to your individual needs to
apparently i can disappear .
flame on , flame off . flame on , flame off
stop it .
what is that thing ?
wait . you mean there s chance we could be full on fantastic ?
grow up , johnny . you want to run around on fire for the rest of your life ?
you are really cramping my style here .
you were at kelvin . any hotter , you are approaching supernova
sweet .
uh , we call my sister the invisible girl . . . the invisible girl .
i am driving .
you are gonna pay for that , pebbles . what ? !
you two need a time out .
johnny ? did you see ben ?
yeah , for the last time , i hope . i am done with this freak show . i am moving back to the real world .
is that what you call it ? real ?
johnny , slow down . think . you know mom did not raise us to
look around , sis ! she is not here . so you can stop talking to me like i am your little boy
i am sorry , sis , for leaving you guys
what are you doing
sis . let me take care of you for once .
if reed s right , then this little trip will double our stock offering .
and if he is not . . . ?
they are ready for you , sir .
our numbers are through the roof . the ipo s tracking at fifty , sixty a share . the bank s five times oversubscribed
it is not just the money . i could make money in my sleep .
then what is it ?
leonard , how is the feed ?
how is the ipo ?
stable . we are looking at low twenties . it is a good number , considering the fallout from
reed s disaster . you know , i half think he did this to me on purpose .
get me on the am shows , larry king , cover of the journal . . . i have got to do something about this scar . make sure they only shoot my right side .
actually , uh , people seem to think the scar humanizes you .
you know , maybe you should get some rest
sir , i have always wondered . . . why sue ? you could have any woman in the world but
make sure you find ben , bring him back here . and keep it quiet . i do not need this to hit the press .
yes sir . you have got the mayor at eight , then a nine thirty interview with the journal
front page ?
you are , you have , i mean , how have you bee
those solar winds are flaring , but i factored them into my coordinates and
well , uh , based on our history . . . you can handle the biogenetics , and i will focus on the molecular physics . or , uhm , maybe i should take the biotech , you work the microscopes , since you have some background in electropho
i , uh , think i remember the number .
as far as crew , i was hoping ben could pilot the mission
material made from self regulating unstable molecules . i have been working on a formula for this .
feeling better ?
yes , thanks .
that is good . that is uh . . . good .
you are happy for me and victor .
i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship
which was ?
for science .
uh , sue . . . ? i cannot .
what ? what do you mean you
it has to be the cloud . it is fundamentally altered our dna .
what ?
sue . your clothes . lose them .
how come ben cannot turn it on and off like us ?
that is what we are here to find out .
it is not invisibility per se . you are bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field . that is what you projected on the bridge .
you should be able to bend light around other objects , even people , if you could control your emotional state better
i am saying , if you had a little more self control , you could locate the trigger . can you remember the exact emotions when
anger . rage . frustration .
okay . is there any way to duplicate that feeling ? some memory or . . .
i am sorry , i am sorry , i did not mean to do that . . . you must think that was some kind of latent hostility or
i mean , you broke up with me , right ?
are you kidding ?
reed . i was ready for the next step , you were not , ergo , i walked .
i think it was a little more complicated than
there were a lot of variables to consider
what are you doing ?
if we can build a machine to re create the storm , we can reverse the polarity
and reverse the mutations
but we are the focus , right reed ? reed . . . ?
of course . of course .
and you sure you can control this thing ? last time did not work out so well .
reed . how close are we to a cure ?
do not let victor push you into making a mistake
he was going to take away all my data , equipment
which is why i am working twenty hours a day , checking every variable
every variable but yourself . you do not eat , sleep . you cannot live in your head like
i could get ben to tap into the baxter s main power to generate enough voltage
remember our first date here . . . ? god , i was so nervous .
you were ?
you know , i bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late ?
you always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you . . . speak his mind . one who was not afraid to tell you what he wanted .
when i walked out , i waited ten minutes outside your door . ten . waiting for you to come find me .
why did not you say something ?
i can . . . make it work .
reed , stop , you need to rest your
the power . . . i need . . . more power . . . to control . . . the storm
sue , i need some of that anger , rage , frustration
i found a broken gasket , from space
but dreams do not pay the bills , do they ? same old reed , the hopeless optimist . still reaching for the stars , with the world on your back .
this is not going to be a problem , is it ?
you back this mission , and i will sign over a fair percentage of any applications or
funny how things turn out , is not it ?
got it . so take a walk , ben . . . i am going to borrow susan for a second .
we have got minutes until it hits , not hours . . . victor , that storm s deadly the radiationgs lethal . we need to abort .
get a grip . reed . we did not come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch . just close the shields . . .
bengs still out there
come on , ben , come on . . .
not until ben is back inside !
just a little banged up . a couple scrapes . why ?
ben did this .
ben did this ?
i am starting to wonder the same thing . . . how much do you know about what happened to you ?
did not go as planned ? it was a catastrophe . you ruined the lives of four people
i ruined ? with all due respect , i told you to abort
abort ? reed , i put my company , my name , billions of dollars on the line , and i will not let you make me look like a fool
victor , if we could understand what happened to us
what are you doing here ?
but i am not done with the machine
it is just business .
surprised i agreed to reed s proposal ?
i understand the business reasons .
it is been a good two years , victor . . . the company s accomplished so much .
right , of course , the company . . . but you see , i have come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with
uh , victor , i hope i have not done something to make you think . . .
what are you doing ?
raising the shields .
that is going on ?
victor , i am sorry i
victor , your scar
i told you , i am fine . it is you i am worried about .
i am sorry i did not get a chance to
you said it was urgent .
victor , wait , slow down a second . i want you to know i appreciate everything you have done for me , but i just do not
he is working round the clock . but the data needs to be tested , analyzed before
if these molecules are not stable , they could make us worse , maybe even kill us .
please do not make this personal
oh , i think you already have .
scuse me .
i know it cannot be easy . life has not changed that much for reed , sue and johnny . at least they can go out in public . but for you ? people staring . whispering behind your back . . .
if you are trying to cheer me up you are doing a helluva job
reed s gonna fix me up
for your sake i hope you are right . i am sorry if that sounds a little skeptical .
brad , can i talk to you a minute ?
brad , i really fucking hate mcdonald s , man . ever since they started in with the chicken , everything went downhill .
you want to work at carl s ?
oh , man , if you could swing something there , i would do anything for you . i want to work with you guys .
i can probably get you in there . just let me talk to dennis taylor .
were those flowers really for me , brad ?
of course .
how much did they cost ?
that is there to do at the point ? god , lisa , we have been going together almost two years , and . . .
brad . i do not want to have to use sex as a tool .
tool ? tool for what ? we have been going together almost two years !
man , i do not even want to see those guys from carl s again .
if you would apologize i think dennis would take you back .
i am just glad we are still together , lisa , because i need you this year .
something happened to them , mon .
go ahead . just make it quick .
totally .
i cannot find it , mon !
it is the first door on your left !
on the ledge ?
first door on your left !
easy , mon .
hamilton , come over here . what is that you have got on ?
this is how i dress all the time .
but you took off your captain kidd uniform .
come on , hamilton . you are going over there to represent captain kidd fish and chips . we have stores all over southern california . part of our image , part of our appeal is in our uniforms . you know that !
you really want me to put all this stuff back on ?
well , i believe you have to fill out a form . there s a pad right around here .
no . i want my money back right now .
well , that is not the way it works , really . and you ate most of your food already , too . . .
i cannot do that . but if you wait a minute . . .
look . just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my . back . okay ? please , brad ?
i am sorry , sir . just let me find the forms here .
mister , if you do not shut up , i am gonna kick of your ass .
hi , brad .
everyone wants to know where lisa is . how should i know where lisa is ? what am i gonna do ? now my little sister goes to the same high school . the party s over . so who do you have first period ?
u . s . history . mr . hand .
mom says to clean up the pool .
why cannot you do it ?
your friends use the pool . your friends messed it up .
your friends use the pool too .
i take out the garbage .
brad ! have mom or dad seen this ?
they are not home yet .
brad , what would you say if i asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the cruising vessel and get rid of them at work ?
i would say . . . who the hell is ron johnson ?
thanks for getting rid of those flowers .
do not worry about it . who sent the flowers ?
it is just some guy i met at swensongs . you do not know him .
is everything okay at work ?
are you kidding ? work is great . i kill at work . i do not even mind mom and dad making me pay rent .
you are going to break up with lisa , are not you ?
i have been doing some thinking . it is my last school year . i am a single , successful guy . i think i want my freedom .
why ? because she will not sleep with you ?
where did you hear that ?
i am just guessing .
well . . . it is true .
maybe you just need to give her some time . she is so nice , brad . everybody loves lisa .
hey , brad . are you still a virgin ?
why ?
i do not know . i was just curious .
maybe yes . maybe no .
you are a virgin !
i did not say that .
are you still a virgin ?
maybe yes . maybe no .
does mom know you have company ?
yeah . this is it . i have some shopping to do .
see you later .
since when do you shop at the flea market anyway ?
you are not going to tell me , are you ?
no .
any problems ?
did you throw away those fries , hamilton ?
they were left over from the last shift .
those were perfectly good fries , hamilton . perfectly good .
come on . clean that counter off brad . let s go . play ball .
did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way ?
he insulted me first . he called me a moron .
did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way ?
yes , sir .
dad says you have to get up !
leave me alone !
dad says you are late again , you butthole !
leave me alone .
jeff you have company !
nice to meet you , stacy .
hey ! we came over to help you with math homework !
well , that is exactly why i brought some wisk for the jacuzzi .
i cannot wait until i can drive next year . i walk every day . it is such a drag .
get a ride with somebody .
sometimes i get a ride with my brother . but he usually works in the mornings , and then drives to school himself .
you know mark ratner really likes you . you like him ?
do you have any ice tea ?
i guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon . are you going to get one ?
i do not know .
are not you curious to see how your class picture turned out ?
do you want to take a quick swim ?
well . . .
pick a suit .
are you really a virgin ?
listen . i feel pretty strange here . because mark really likes you , and he is my friend .
you are a really good kisser .
so are you . are you shaking ?
why do not you take off your clothes , mike ?
you first .
i want you to know that it is your final decision if we should continue or not .
hey , mike ?
what ? are you all right ?
i think we are making a lot of noise .
that is wrong ?
i think i came . did not you feel it ?
oh . hi .
i did not see you this morning .
look , i am kind of in a hurry .
i am in a hurry too . i just thought i could say hi to you .
that is going on ?
mike , there s something that is been on my mind and i have to tell you about it .
why do not you call me up tonight ?
how do you know it is mine ? we only did it once .
take that back .
there s only one thing we can do . we have got to get rid of it . we have got to get an abortion .
we have got to get an abortion ?
yeah . my brother art got his girlfriend one once .
it is already planned , mike . it is going to cost at the free clinic .
does not sound free to me . so you want me to pay for it ?
half . okay ? seventy five dollars . and a ride to the clinic .
mike ! you have a mess on c !
all right . all right . i just cleaned b . give me a break .
do you ever look at those girls who work at swensongs ? they are beautiful . and i have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week .
you . . . are a wuss . part wimp . part pussy .
what do you mean wuss ? this girl is my exact type . it is her . definitely her .
it is definitely your mama .
all right . . . where did you see her ?
she is in my biology class .
did you get her number ?
no .
did you get her name ?
no . it is too soon .
it is never too soon ! girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes .
well , what do you want me to do ? go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say , hello ! i would like you to take your clothes off and jump on me ?
i would . yeah .
really ?
i can see it all now . this is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at fotomat this summer . you bought forty bucks of fucking film and you never even talked to her .
you tell me , mike . what do i do ?
do not talk to her . let her know . use your face . use your body . use everything . this is what i do . i just sent out the vibe and i have personally found that . . . girls do respond . something happens .
of course something happens . you put the vibe out to thirty million chicks , you know something s gonna happen .
that is the idea , rat . that is the attitude .
the business is changing , rat . i will tell you , these kids today . . . they do not even listen to aerosmith .
i hear they all dress like that at lincoln now .
hey , rat .
yeah ?
knock it off , damone . i need real help .
okay . tell me . that is the five point plan ?
and that is how you talk to a girl , rat . voila . you cannot miss .
i think i have got it . once i get going , i will be okay . but . . . how do i get started ? i mean , i hardly know her .
yo .
damone . it is mark .
mark . what happened to your date ?
it is happening right now . i am here at the atlantis . everything s fine except . . . i left my wallet at home .
did you go home and get it ?
damone , are you there ?
hey , mark . is that you ?
damone ! you come here ?
i come for the seafood . it is great ! hey . . . you know what , mark ? i found your wallet the other day . you want it back ?
well , i have gotta be running .
poor guy .
no . i do not think so . not right now .
if you ask me , she is pretty aggressive . you understand what i am saying ?
no damone . i do not understand .
she was not really your girlfriend anyway .
hey fuck you damone . there s a lot of girls out there and you mess around with stacy . what have you got to prove ?
jesus . i am sorry .
i always stick up for you . whenever people say aw , that damone is a loudmouth and they say that a lot i say you just do not know damone . when someone says you are an idiot , i tell them wouldamone s not an idiot . you just do not know him . well , you know , damone , maybe they do know you pretty good . and i am just finding out .
you are losing it , damone .
the attitude , damone , is only good until you meet the right girl .
and . . . you can only tell it is the right girl if you are sensitive .
sensitive what is that ?
sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking .
so what makes you so sensitive ?
well , for one , i read . i do not watch as much television as you . i am trying to feel things more . i am learning a lot about people .
what do you read ? that is the last book you read ?
lust for life . it is the story of vincent van gough .
yeah , well , i saw the movie . that must mean i am sensitive too .
are you linda barrett ?
yes .
all right , what you want to do is go to the free clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly several times a week and that you need nornel one plus fifty s .
and they do not call my parents ?
not if you are over sixteen .
okay . thanks a lot , linda .
how have you been ?
outrageous , merv . nice to be here . i feel great .
i was going to say . . . your eyes look a little red .
seriously , merv , everything is great . i was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend , maybe going up to the mountains .
i wanted to talk a little bit about school , if i could . . .
school . school is no problem . all you have to do is go to get the grades . and if you know something , all you have to do is go about half the time .
how often do you go ?
i hear you brought a film clip with you . do you want to set it up for us ?
merv , this is the action down at sunset cliffs at about six in the morning .
who s that ?
are you going to ride that wave ?
that is going through your mind right here , jeff ? the danger of it all ?
hey , slow down . this is my brother s car .
i thought he was out of town .
he is .
seen the new playboy ?
naw . any good ?
suzanne somers tits .
all right .
what the fuck is this guy doing ?
it is a bunch of jocks in a granada !
my brother s car !
we just missed the turnoff to the party .
my brother is going to kill us . he is gonna kill you and then he is gonna kill me . he is gonna kill us .
just be glad you are all right .
my brother is gonna shit .
make up your mind . is he gonna shit , or is he gonna kill us ?
first he is gonna shit . and then he is gonna kill us .
will you just relax , mon ? he is not gonna kill us . my father is a television repairman . he is got all kinds of tools . i can fix this car .
that is him ! he did it !
how is it going .
do not you like him ?
yeah , but i fucked up . you can take it . really .
come on , stacy , it is your section and your man .
what should i do ?
he gave me his card . ron johnson , audio consultant .
should we buy a frame for that ?
come on , linda , i have not had a boyfriend all summer . you promised when i started working at the mall that my life would change . . . do you think he will call this week ?
listen , stace , you want to know about guys ? i will tell you . they are mostly chicken . before i met doug i chased after every guy i thought was cute . i thought if i gave out a vibe they would get the message and call me up . well , guess what ? they do not call .
so what did you do ?
i called them . if i was sitting next to a guy and i wanted to sit closer , i would sit closer . if i wanted to kiss him , i would just do it . you want ron johnson ? grab him .
face it . with some guys you have to make the first move . a lot of guys are just . . . wussies .
really ?
stacy , what are you waiting for ? you are fifteen . i did it when i was thirteen . it is no huge thing . it is just sex . if you do not , one of the other girls will .
he was hot , was not he ?
i cannot believe i start high school tomorrow .
i hear some surfer pulled a knife on mr . hand this morning .
no way ! he just called him a dick .
linda . that girl looks just like pat benatar .
do you think guys find that attractive ?
yeah but they look more sophisticated . you would probably think they would be better in bed .
what do you mean better in bed . you either do it or you do not .
no there are variables that , like , i might not be good at .
what variables ?
like , you know , giving blow jobs .
that is the big deal ?
well i never did it .
just kidding . about cc .
was it great ?
it was okay .
you will always remember your first time .
it was nice .
so tell me , do you like ron ? is it serious ?
come on , linda . it is just sex .
there . . . there s his car . i know he is at work tonight . he has not come into swensongs since he called my house . my mother told him i was still at high school , after i told him i was nineteen . i guess i should tell him i am fifteen .
do not you dare , you will never hear from him again .
does doug care that you are seventeen ?
doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like . that is why i am marrying him .
if he ever calls again i will say i am eighteen .
you have got to get used to working christmas . people are always screaming and yelling . . . then they get home and they are all christmasy .
i think christmas brings out the worst in people .
i guess ron has not called yet .
do not you think it meant anything to him . even if i am fifteen ?
i should quit this job . i am going to get so fat working here . . . nobody will ever take me out .
stacy . how many times do i have to tell you ? you are really going to be beautiful . . . someday .
what do you think of that guy who works at the theatre ? you know , mark ratner .
oh , come on . what is he ? fifteen ?
i sent a letter to doug today . i will be so glad when he gets out here .
you really ought to look at this , linda . there s a drawing on every page . . . and all these quizzes . it is like school .
listen to this . . . what are your mate s three most erogenous zones ?
okay , penis , that is one , balls . . .
would not penis and balls be the same category ?
you are right . probably penis , mouth and neck .
all right ! here s another one . the most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first , you climax first , you and your mate climax together ?
climax together .
does that ever happen ?
no . but it is a nice idea .
how long does doug take ?
i do not know . thirty to forty minutes .
that is doug do in chicago ?
what do you think ?
i did not ask for any help . did you , linda ?
god , he hardly even talks anymore .
stacy ! i have got water in my ears . do you have any q tips ?
god , stacy , it is not that sad . it is just david soul and ricardo montalban .
you have been acting very strange the last few weeks .
what do you think it is ?
what do you think it is ?
it could not be .
it could be . i had a pregnancy test at the clinic . i will find out monday . i guess it was damone .
of course it was damone . if it was ron johnson , you would be out to here !
i am not going to tell him . he is an asshole . i hate him .
you know , there s one thing you did not tell me about guys .
what ?
you did not tell me that they can be so nice , so great . . . but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they are five years old .
i really thought he would show up . i waited . . . and waited . . . and waited . . .
that little prick .
then i called his house , and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father .
that little prick .
i paid for it and everything .
there goes your stereo for another year . mike damone is a no brain little prick . i am not letting him get away with this .
do not do anything , linda . i would rather just forget about it . i do not even like the guy .
another summer of working at swensongs .
come on . there s lots of men around here . keep your eyes open .
you know , linda . i have finally figured it out . it is not sex i want . anyone can have sex .
what do you want ?
i want romance .
where is doug ?
he is not coming .
not coming ? what happened ?
he says he is got to stay in chicago . he says i should visit him sometimes .
sometime ?
yeah , like maybe never .
but what are you going to do ?
well i might go to dartmouth .
dartmouth ? !
i did not tell anyone i applied cause i never thought i would make it .
i cannot believe it ! but what about doug ?
there s a world of guys out there . i just wish i did not have to date any of them .
yeah . i am registered for this class .
what class ?
this is u . s . history , right ? i saw the globe in the window .

i could not make it in time .
you mean , you could not ? or you would not ?
i do not know , mon . the food lines took forever .

now , mr . spicoli , comes a rare moment for me . now i have the unique pleasure of squaring our account . tonight , you and i are going to talk in great detail about the davis agreement , all the associated treaties , and the american revolution in particular . now if you can just turn to chapter of lord of truth and liberty .
hey , it is in my locker , mr . hand .
i think i have made my point with you tonight .
hey , mr . hand , can i ask you a question ?
that is that ?
do you have a guy like me every year ? a guy to . . . i do not know , make a show of . teach other kids lessons and stuff ?
well , you will find out next year .
no way , mon . when i graduate u . s . history i ai not even coming over to your side of the building .
if you graduate .
do not worry , spicoli . you will probably squeak by .
aloha , mr . hand !

do you have a pen ? this one s out of ink .
thanks for coming to get me .
this is a nice car .
do you have mrs . george for english ?
yeah . she is pretty good .
joey at cinema four said this is a pretty good restaurant .
do you know what you want ?
i think i will have the seafood salad special .

where is mike today ?
today s april th . damone never comes to school on april th .
that is april th ?
it is john bonham s birthday .
john bonham ?
john bonham . the drummer for led zeppelin . he died a couple years ago . every birthday he stays home and plays everything john bonham ever recorded . it is like his own holiday .
i made a fool of myself .
nobody noticed . do not worry about it . we will just stay out here until everyone comes out , we will blend back in .
what about the notes ?
hi , mark .
hi , stacy . how are you ?
yeah ? about fifty people i did not know wrote that in my annual .
really ?
well , i do not know , i may be doing some traveling this summer . i do not know how much i will be around . . . but i will give you a call sometime .
are you ready to order here ?
well . . . sure . she will have the seafood salad special . and i will have . . . the same .
anything to drink ?
two cokes .
are you sure there s nothing else i can bring you ?
sir ? this telegram came for you . actually , it is not for you . it is for somebody named thompson , but it says care of raoul duke . does that make sense ?
i checked the register for this man thompson . we do not show him but i figured he might be part of your team .
what confused us was dr . gonzo s signature on the telegram from los angeles . when we knew he was right here in the hotel .
you did the right thing . never try to understand a press message . about half the time we use codes especially with dr . gonzo .
tell me . when will the doctor be awake ?
well . . . the manager , mr . heem , would like to meet him . nothing unusual . mr . heem likes to meet all our large accounts . . . put them on a personal basis . . . just a chat and a handshake , you understand .
but he will be available ? perhaps later this morning ?
look . that telegram was all scrambled . it was actually from thompson , not to him . western union must have gotten the names reversed . i have to get going . i have to get out to the track .
there s no hurry ! the race is over !
let s have lunch !
of course , i could hear what the clerk was really saying . . .
certainly , mr . duke !
oh , and could i get a quart of wild turkey , two fifths of baccardi , and a night s worth of ice delivered to my room , please ?
do not worry about a thing , sir . just enjoy your stay .
that is the message ? my light is blinking .
ah , yes . mr . duke ? you have one message call lucy at the americana hotel , room .
mr . duke ? hello , mr . duke , i am sorry we were cut off a moment ago . . . i thought i should call again , because i was wondering . . .
what ? what was that crazy bitch said to him ? there s a war on , man ! people are being killed !
killed ?
in vietnam ! on the goddamn television !
oh . . . yes . . . yes . . . this terrible war . when will it end ?
the woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed . i think she was crying . . .
crying ? why was she crying ?
well , uh . she did not say mr . duke . but since i know you are here with the police convention . . .
look , you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again . we are watching her very carefully . . . this woman has been into laudanum . it is a controlled experiment , but i suspect we will need your cooperation before this thing is over .
well , certainly . . . we are always happy to cooperate with the police . . .
do not worry . you are protected . just treat this poor woman like you would treat any other human being in trouble .
what ? ah . . . yes , yes , i see what you mean . . . yes . . . so , you will be responsible then ?
rum and ice , please .
you are another one of these california boys . your friend here s been telling us about dope fiends .
they are everywhere . nobody s safe . and sure as hell not in the south . they like warm weather . . . you would never believe it . in l . a . it is out of control . first it was drugs , now it is witchcraft .
naw ! that is science fiction stuff !
naked ! ?
cut their goddamn heads off . every one of them . that is what we are doing in california .
hell , no . we would never hear the goddamn end of it .
dobermans do not talk .
i am a whiskey man myself . we do not have much trouble from drugs where i come from . . .
you will . one of these nights you will wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart .
naw !
they will climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big bowie knives . they might even sit on your wife s chest . put the blade right down on her throat .
what happened ? what did they do to her ?
do ? jesus christ , man . they chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot ! then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood !
yeh . the big guy used to be a major in the marines .
a major !
we know where he lives , but we cannot get near the house .
naw ! not a major .
he wanted the pineal gland .
really ?
hell , i really hate to hear this . because everything that happens in california seems to get down our way , sooner or later . mostly atlanta . but that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful . all we had to do was to keep em under surveillance . they did not roam around much . . . but now jesus , it seems nobody s safe .
you are going to need to take the bull by the horns go to the mat with this scum .
what do you mean by that ?
where ya coming from , young man ?
las vegas .
a great town , that vegas . i bet you had good luck there . you are the type .
i know . i am a triple scorpio .
oh , my god ! . . .
this is my granddaughter . . .
i want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney ! he is not just some dingbat i found on the strip . he is a foreigner . i think he is probably samoan . but it does not matter , does it ? are you prejudiced ?
hell , no !
i did not think so . because in spite of his race , this man is extremely valuable to me . hell , i forgot all about this beer . you want one ? how about some ether ?
what ?
thanks for the ride . thanks a lot . i like you guys . do not worry about me .
one toke over the line , sweet jesus .
we are your friends . we are not like the others .
if so well , we will just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere . because it goes without saying that we cannot turn him loose . he would report us at once to some kind of outback nazi law enforcement agency , and they will run us down like dogs . . .
jesus ! did i say that ?
or just think it ? was i talking ? did they hear me ?
god hell ! i think i see the pattern ! this one sounds like real trouble ! you are going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over . as your attorney i must advise you that you will need a very fast car with no top and after that , the cocaine . and then the tape recorder , for special music , and some acapulco shirts . . . this blows my weekend , because naturally i will have to go with you and we will have to arm ourselves .
i tell you , my man . this is the american dream in action ! we would be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end .
o . k . , o . k . , yes . hang onto it . we will be there in thirty minutes . i finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring . what ? ! of course the gentleman has a major credit card ! do you realize who the fuck you are talking to ?
do not take any guff from these swine . now we need a sound store with the finest equipment . nothing dinky . one of those new belgian heliowatts with a voice activated shotgun mike , for picking up conversations in oncoming cars .
we will not make the nut unless we have unlimited credit .
. . . and we are chock full of that !
damn right !
he said he understood , but i could see in his eyes that he did not . he was lying to me .
where is the medicine ?
turn up the fucking music ! my heart feels like an alligator ! volume ! clarity ! bass ! we must have bass ! that is wrong with us ? are you goddamn old ladies ?
you scurvy shyster bastard ! watch your language ! you are talking to a doctor of journalism !
what the fuck are we doing out here ? somebody call the police ! we need help !
pay no attention to this swine . he cannot handle the medicine .
savage henry has cashed his check ! we are going to rip his lungs out !
oh , jesus ! did you see what god just did to us ?
god did not do that ! you did it ! you are a fucking narcotics agent , that was our cocaine , you pig !
you better be careful . plenty of vultures out here . they will pick your bones clean before morning .
how long do i have ?
maybe thirty more minutes . as your attorney , i advise you to drive at top speed . it will be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal . are you ready for that ? checking into a vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid .
two cuba libres with beer and mescal on the side . who s lacerda , he is waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor ?
i was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo . and somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things ! it will not be long before they tear us to shreds !
i just went upstairs to see this man lacerda . i told him i knew what he was up to . . . he says he is a photographer ! but when i mentioned savage henry he freaked ! he knows we are onto him !
that is the press table . where you have to sign in for our credentials . shit , let s get it over with . you handle that , and i will check on the room .
shoot it .
what are you talking about ?
that is good . . .
i think he is lying to us . i could see it in his eyes .
total control now . tooling along the main drag on a saturday night in vegas , two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible . . . stoned , ripped , twisted . . . good people !
how about nickel nick s slot arcade ? hot slots , that sounds heavy . twenty nine cent hotdogs . . .
look , what are we doing here ? are we here to entertain ourselves , or to do the job ?
why ?
holy shit ! they almost had us there ! that was quick thinking .
jesus creeping shit !
did the mescaline just kick in ? or was that debbie reynolds in a silver afro wig ? !
this is the place . they will never fuck with us here .
some angry rotarian shoves you and you think that is happening here ? that is going on ? then you hear yourself mumbling .
dogs fucked the pope , no fault of mine . watch out ! . . . why money ? my name is brinks i was born . . . born ?
i hate to say this , but this place is getting to me . i think i am getting the fear .
nonsense . we came here to find the american dream , and now we are right in the vortex you want to quit . you must realize that we have found the main nerve .
that is what gives me the fear .
look over there . two women fucking a polar bear .
please , do not tell me those things . . . not now . this is my last drink . how much money can you lend me ?
not much . why ?
i have to go .
go ?
yes . leave the country . tonight .
calm down . you will be straight in a few hours .
no . this is serious . one more hour in this town and i will kill somebody !
ok . i will lend you some money . let s go outside and see how much we have left .
can we make it ?
that depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door .
i want to leave fast .
ok . lets pay this bill and get up very slowly . it is going to be a long walk .
when does this thing stop ?
did you see that ? some sonofabitch kicked me in the back .
probably the bartender . he wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress .
good god ! let s get out of here ! where is the elevator ?
do not run . they would like any excuse to shoot us .
yeah . . . i thought we might need it . . .
let s go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose .
no , we should leave the poor bastard alone . i get the feeling that he is avoiding us for some reason .
do not kid yourself . that portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous . he is watching us like a hawk .
that dirty bastard ! i knew it ! he is got hold of my woman !
that little blonde groupie with the film crew ? you think he sodomized her ?
where would you get that knife ?
room service sent it up . i wanted something to cut the limes .
what limes ?
have you made a deal with him ? did you put him on to her ?
you evil son of a bitch . you better hope there s some thorazine in that bag , because if there s not , you are in bad trouble .
music ! turn it up . put that tape on .
what tape ?
jefferson airplane . white rabbit . i want a rising sound .
you are doomed . i am leaving here in two hours and then they are going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps . right there in that tub .
i dig my own graves . green water and the white rabbit . put it on .
of course , i am your attorney , i will give you all the time you need , at my normal rates an hour but you will be wanting a cushion , so , why do not you just lay one of those bills down there beside the radio , and fuck off ?
how about a check ?
i want that fucking radio !
do not touch it ! get back in that tub !
not me . it would blast you through the wall stone dead in ten seconds and they would make me explain it !
bullshit ! do not make me use this .
jesus .
fuck yes . i was beginning to think i was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it .
you bastard ! you would do that , would not you ?
why worry ? you will like it . nothing in the world like a mace high . forty five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves . . .
you cheap honky sonofabitch . . .
why not ? hell , just a minute ago , you were asking me to kill you ! and now you want to kill me ! what i should do , goddamnit , is call the police !
the cops ?
there s no choice . i would not dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife !
you bastard ! i need a lawyer immediately !
what are you doing in baker ? did not you get my telegram ?
what ? fuck telegrams . i am in trouble . you worthless bastard . i will cripple your ass for this ! all that shit in the car is yours ! you understand that ? when i finish testifying out here you will be disbarred !
you degenerate pig !
well ? what are your plans ?
plans ?
lucy .
shit . i met her on the plane and i had all that acid . you know , those little blue barrels . i gave her a cap before i realized . . . she is a religious freak . . . jesus , she is never even had a drink .
listen , she is running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months . it is terrible .
jesus christ . i knew you were sick but i never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff .
it is straight economics . this girl is a god send . shit , she can make us a grand a day .
no ! stop talking like that .
i figure she can do about four at a time . christ , if we keep her full of acid that is more like two grand a day . maybe three .
you filthy bastard . i should cave your fucking head in .
no ! i felt sorry for the girl , i wanted to help her !
the only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards . but , it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect my attorney .
we have to cut her loose . she is got two hundred dollars . and we can always call the cops up there in montana , where she lives , and turn her in .
what ? . . . what kind of goddamn monster are you ?
it just occurred to me , that she has no witnesses . anything that she says about us is completely worthless .
okay , lucy , it is time to go meet barbra . . .
i gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe . also , i told him i would be there myself in an hour , and if she was not , i would come back out here and rip his lungs out .
that is good . you cannot be subtle in this town .
as your attorney , i advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline .
maybe we should take it easy tonight .
i saw these bastards in easy rider , but i did not believe they were real . not like this . not hundreds of them !
they are actually nice people when you get to know them .
man , i know these people in my goddamn blood !
do not mention that word around here . you will get them excited .
this is a fucking nightmare .
read the newspapers .
hell , in malibu alone , these goddamn satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day . all they want is the blood . they will take people right off the street if they have to .
what could they do ? the guy that took the head was about six seven , and maybe three hundred pounds . he was packing two lugers , and the others had m s .
they just ran back out into death valley you know , where manson turned up . . .
like big lizards .
yeh , naked ! . . . except for the weapons .
that is wrong with you ? hell , somebody has to do it .
sure . it is all on the q . t . , but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line .
sometimes it is easier to just rip out the backstraps .
good work . they will treat us like goddamn lepers after that .
lucy is looking for you .
no , she is looking for you .
me ?
ok , goddamnit ! . . . look . . . i will call her . i will get her off our backs . you are right . she is my problem .
it is gone too far .
what is this ?
adrenochrome . . .
hi , lucy ? yeah , it is me . i got your message . . . what ? hell , no , i taught the bastard a lesson he will never forget . . . what ? no , not dead , but he will not be bothering anybody for a while . yeah . i left him out there , i stomped him , then pulled all his teeth out . . .
i remember slumping on the bed , his performance had given me a bad jolt . for a moment i thought his mind had snapped that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies . but the room was quiet again .
where would you get this ?
never mind , it is absolutely pure .
i know , but the guy did not have any cash to pay me . he is one of these satanism freaks . he offered me human blood said it would take me higher than i have ever been in my life . i thought he was kidding , so i told him i would just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on .
why not ? we should get some of that . just eat a big handful and see what happens .
some of what ?
extract of pineal !
sure . that is a good idea . one whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia .
man , your head would swell up like a watermelon , you would probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours . . .
right !
. . . grow claws . . . bleeding warts .
yes !
man i will try about anything but i would never touch a pineal gland .
so do we , lady .
i think we should put her on the payroll . see what she comes up with .
alright , alice . . . you will be contacted by inspector rock . arthur rock . he will be posing as a politician .
fuck the car . they should make these things with a goddamn fm radio .
there was nothing in the atmosphere of the north star to put me on my guard . . .
i was stupid with shock not knowing whether to run or start laughing .
how much is the lemon meringue pie ?
what are you doing ? you were supposed to turn back there !
the airport is over there !
no ! i cannot get out ! they will crucify me . i will have to take the blame !
ridiculous ! just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and i picked you up . you never saw me before . shit , this town is full of white cadillac convertibles . i plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate . you ready ?
do not take any guff from those swine . remember , if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the right people .
please . . . please . . . i am only the maid . i did not mean nothin ! . . .
what made you do it ? who paid you off ?
the dope ring . you must know that is going on in this hotel . why do you think we are here ?
maybe she is telling the truth . maybe she is not part of it .
you would pay me for that ?
you are damn right . but the first time you say anything about this , to anybody you will go straight to prison for the rest of your life . that is your name ?
the password is one hand washes the other . the minute you hear that , you say i fear nothing .
may i see your license .
could i have that , please ?
you realize . . .
yeah . i know . i am guilty . i understand that . i knew it was a crime but i did it anyway . shit , why argue ? i am a fucking criminal .
you know i get the feeling you could use a nap . there s a rest area up ahead . why do not you pull over and sleep a few hours ?
okay . here s how it is . what goes into my book , as of noon , is that i apprehended you . . . for driving too fast , and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area . . . your stated destination , right ? where you plan to take a long nap . do i make myself clear ?
how far is baker ? i was hoping to stop there for lunch .
not my jurisdiction . the city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area . can you make it that far ?
you are lying ! you were after the evidence . who put you up to this the manager ?
i do not know what you are talking about !
bullshit ! you are just as much a part of it as they are !
come on , baby do not try to tell us you never heard of the grange gorman .
in that case , maybe she can help .
what ?
oh lord ! i would do just about anything for that !
oh , and do not bother to make up the room . that way we will not have to risk another of these little incidents , will we ?
whatever you say , gentlemen . i cannot tell you how sorry i am about what happened . . .
it serves you right . you cheating jerk .
spare me .
stop !
what the fuck are you doing he is in there !
you are killing him !
you cannot keep me here . this is bullshit . fucking bullshit . this is fucking bullshit !
we cannot risk letting them in .
careful .
i will not die because of him !
we should go ! we should go right now !
are you two all right ? did you see that ! ? they left ! we made it ! i think we made it !
they will be back .
you know where it is ?
we will meet in three hours ?
where are you two going ?
sorry , did not mean to scare you .
where is everyone ?
is it clear ? !
yeah .
is there a gun pointing at you ?
my god damn foot is gone ! who fucking shot me ? who fucking shot me ! ?
well , it do not look pretty .
i got my . here . that is six shots and two refills . downstairs , i think we got another rifle , maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools . maybe a couple boxes of shells for the judge .
i do not think you should . . .
one keg of beast for the basement , then , truck s dry .
i have a cb in my truck , we could get some help out here .
who the hell would you call ?
stop it .
we shot a skunk .
hey ! get quiet or get out .
i think i know where a cb is .
where is that ?
okay , now . easy steps . easy breaths . easy steps .
oh !
wha ?
you got something better ?
we will be food , dickheads !
well , your last words can be i told you so .
that is the oldest of the bunch , looked like the grandpapa . we caught the little one , junior , in the cooler there . as we have seen , what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed .
and the rest of em ?
and that is how i ended up here .
so , your husband ditched you ?
no , no , no it was . . . it was wild out there , no time to think , we just moved . he did not leave me . he just ran . he just ran .
they are right here .
jesus christ , i am gonna have a stroke .
do not bullshit me ! if you know a way out of this place and you are holding out
what tunnel ? where ?
it is in the basement , about a hundred yards long . it spits out on the backside of that hill down the way . there s a truck there .
hey ! no , i am not trusting him either , that is why you and i will both be going with him .
what ! ? i am not going down there again !
this is it ! this is our only way out ! they have this place surrounded . we go out the front , we are dead . we go out the back , we are dead , but if we go under them . . . we might just make it . now , who else is in ? seven can go .
you all sure about this ?
where is the tunnel ?
we just smeared a skunk .
i am gonna shoot him if they do not get him first .
you seem mighty collected about this .
you are trusting that guy ? he will ditch us and never look back .
fuck you too .
scared ?
no . you ?
i would love to be macho , but this is a pants wetter from all angles .
ohhh .
what ?
that is an unwise thing to say , you know that ?
just an observation .
so , what now ? did those things leave ?
why do not you go check it out ?
any more ideas animal planet ?
you were not helping .
i am telling ya , you got the cloth too deep , you are asking for it .
do you drive a short beer bus or something ? you go out there you get eaten , you stay in here you get eaten , anyone comes to help they get eaten . do not you see a pattern here , spuds makenzie ?
well then i guess we should just give up .
we are better off .
come on !
what now , geronimo ?
why do you take shit from him ?
look , yeah , he is an ass , but he is my brother . que sera sera .
your brother , huh ?
yep .
your parents of relation ?
i am in .
we are going to get help .
we gotta try .
we gotta be close .
all right ! tell us about the truck !
my truck cannot be more than ten feet away . we load into the back , i can get in the front and we roll out of here .
that is in the back ?
yeah , the lot s right there . my truck is right out back .
it is imperative that you get that truck moving .
how are you holding up ?
push and twist , it is child proof .
oh .
what is this ?
magic potion . you should try a little .
oh , no .
it will calm your nerves . works like a charm .
really ?
uh huh . just put a dab on your tongue .
will i go crazy or something ?
no , no , it calms you , makes everything nice and smooth . just takes the edge off like a beer , but in a fraction of the time .
wait , before you do that , help me to the kitchen , i need to lay down . there s a cot back there .
but
it is much safer in there , sweety .
does not your foot hurt ?
um hmmm .
you wanna see , baby ?
sure .
how much you got ?
how much you got to see the show ?
what ? really ?
my husband . . .
well , where is the sonuvabitch ! ?
he is dead .
jesus christ on the cross . . . someone make sense .
easy . we are surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before . some kind of animals . real fast , volatile , predators . one went through three of your patrons like they were kleenex .
so , your dead hubby shot me twice , three of my customers have been eaten , and there are angry creatures outside ?
he only shot you once .
huh ?
will these boards hold ?
the boards are solid oak planks , and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath . nothing real or supernatural is busting through this , least nothing the size of the beasts .
in the kitchen , under the sink .
go for it . it is by the far wall . a small wave band . channel is the emergency frequency . but i do not see the point .
what ?
what ?
what do you mean what ?
huh ?
that is going on between you two ?
that is it for ! ?

let me make this clear if we stay , we die !
that is that ! ? wha cha say ? huh ?
this one will just stun ya , but this one will put ya to sleep .
you young uns worry about weapons , i am thinking bout strategy .
oh ? and that is that ?
sit still , look less like a meal .
i would not do that , son .
i will go with ya .
welcome back .
they were all over the place .

i am in a wheelchair , the truck sounds pretty good .
nothing will happen to you . you get on my back , hold on tight and we truck out of here together .

i admire your strength .

i will do anything to help .
i know . thanks . just do not tell anyone i have a soft side .
we should stick together out there .
did we make it ?
hey little bear , are not you going to join the others ?
do you have a note to corroborate these claims ?
um , well . . .
are you lying to me ?
well . . .
what did we say about lying ?
i am not lying .
you know that no one likes a liar , right ?
what have you done now , broke the darn thing ?
well . . . come on .
this is a mistake . no . this is a disaster .
come on , it is just what you need ! let everyone see you . talk to them , live it up !
but we have been at it since six this morning . at least you could have let me go home and change .
look , frances , i did not want this job . think i am crazy ? but you begged me improve your image . so please . . . lemme try , huh ?
you are right . i am sorry . okay , let s go get em .
here , take a few of these . studio makes em in the basement . they keep the fat off .
so not only am i a troublesome bitch , but i am fat too ?
frances ? oh no .
refill my drink , will you , bob ?
what are you doing ?
putting on my armor .
come on , frances . louella parsons is here . she wants to talk to you , help you out .
louella . . . did not she call me a spoiled little bitch ?
come on , she is an important columnist ! that is the matter ? i thought you wanted these people to forgive you .
forgive . . . ? for what ?
and on top of her political activities , now she is got a lawyer . she wants out of her contract , mr . bebe . she says she is through with motion pictures .
i am sure it was not me , it was not me . . .
excuse me , sir ?
well . . . you could always dump her , mr . bebe . teach her a lesson . there are a million beautiful girls out there who do not give a damn about politics .
that is not the point . frances farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio , and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you . no . no , that young lady has a contract , and she is going to honor it .
oh . i mean , good .
good morning , mr . bebe !
who s this ?
frances farmer , contract player , six month option .
okay . good tits . cannot we show them off a little more ?
i guess so , sir .
that is frances . i am not the cookbook .
i like your looks . you have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties . . . garbo , dietrich
thank you
since we have you on a seven year contract , i am planning long range . i am going to loan you out to sam goldwyn to make a picture called come and get it .
really ? that is a very good book . it would make a terrific
society is falling apart , miss farmer , and people have to buckle down , do their jobs . you see , i view myself as the henry ford of motion picture industry , and i cannot have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head lights , now can i ?
but i am concerned with everything , mr . bebe .
no , i am concerned with everything .
but i am the one up there on the screen .
look , mr . bebe , you can hold me to my contract , but you cannot break me . i am back , and i am gonna make the best of it .
hi frances , got a minute ?
well , i suppose i should just say it . it is your clothes .
my clothes ?
yeah , i mean slacks . . . and work clothes . . . and that awful car
it is a perfectly good car . it runs .
yes , but . . . really , i hate to sound . . . it is just that the public expects something different from its stars . people will not take you seriously .
i do not care if my clothes are taken seriously . or my car .
you know what i mean .
that is not all , frances . mr . bebe is very concerned about your politics . he hears you have been donating money , speaking at rallies .
yup . claire . . . please , please tell mr . bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life , we would make a lot better movies .
i am sorry , frances . it is my job , you know ?
i know . this is a factory and we each have our jobs . the writer writes , the director directs , and the actress . . .
face it ! confess it ! you are weak !
i am not !
you are afraid !
i am not !
you do not want to show your whole soul ugly , mis shapen , and pitiful you do not want to show it
good , good . give them that .
madam . . . ?
oh my god ! frances , i am such a cad . i cannot go through with this . my wife is in europe , but this is her house . . . her bedroom . i cannot ask you to . . .
okay , but come here first .
huh .
the group is more than a theatre company . it is the embodiment of an ideal . our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense , a creative individual and an instrument of change . you see
really , mr . clurman , you do not have to sell me .
forgive my indulgence . seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy . the point is , mr . odets here has written a wonderful play . most of the roles are cast , but we have not found our female lead . . .
. . . not only an artist , but an instrument of change . we must look to the world around us , not content to observe , but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs . we will not stand idly by as fascist bombs obliterate democracy . we contribute our profits , for if fascism is not stopped in spain , it will spread across europe , jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive . the artist , to be vital , must be a soldier too .
hello , harold .
frances .
where is clifford ?
he is not here .
that is up ?
i hear you are meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract .
that is right . i do not want them breathing down my neck while we are in london .
you do not think i am good enough ?
what ? ! good lord no , it is just . . . it is money . we needed backing and . . . well , we found it .
who ?
an actress .
a rich actress .
yes . that is the deal . she plays lorna .
but . . . but wait a minute . we are supposed to be different , right ? clifford says . . . this theatre is supposed to be different ! and this play . . . this play is all about what greed and money do to people !
i know , but
what does clifford say ?
right now we have to be practical .
does clifford even know ? you did not tell him , did you ? i am gonna tell him . where is he ?
hey , where is the fire , sister ?
in my eyes , officer .
cool off , beautiful . did not you see the sign says dimout zone ? there s a war on , you know ?
come on . you are seriously trying to tell me the japs cannot find los angeles without my headlights ?
get your clothes on .
you have no right ! you have no fucking right , you bastards ! get the hell out of here
get your clothes on , lady
get out !
you learn your lines ?
sort of .
there have been some calls .
who ?
well . . . about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called , that is her name ?
claire ?
yeah , claire . she said she was fired . too bad , huh ?
fired ?
there was another call too . from your agent . he says your summer stock deal is all set . so you are going back east , huh ?
. . . yes .
without me .
showdown .
you were not going to tell me , were you ? just pack up and leave , is that it ?
dick , we need some time apart
hey , i am not a complete fool , you know . i can see you are going sour on me , and when i try to do something about it , you turn your back and say it is nothing .
dick , i cannot even breathe here . . .
dwayne ! i am dwayne now ! and you damn well better get used to it !
dick . . .
i do not suppose it occurred to you that i might want to leave too , that i might want to do theatre ? no , cause you do not want me along , do you ? and the reason has nothing to do with summer stock .
no ?
no . it is all about that night , is not it ?
what night ?
the premiere . i never pressed you about it but god damn it , you are gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were !
oh , god ! let s get her out of here tonight , right now ! let s take her with us !
the hearing s tomorrow . if she gets out legally , they cannot come after her .
look at her ! she will never pass that sanity test tomorrow . . .
let s get out of here ! i will lose my job !
harry !
we are all square now , harry . right ?
all square , doc .
doctor , it may sound odd , but i believe i have profited from my stay here . it is just what i have needed , to get away like this . but i am recuperated now . i have had lots of time to think and i have made a few decisions about my life . i am ready to get on with it .
i know you believe that .
. . . do not you ?
no . cut this runaround , doctor . i know better .
listen to yourself , frances . the resistance , the anger in your voice .
you . . . i am sorry , forgive me . doctor , tell me honestly , what do i have to do to get out of here ?
be patient , that is all . take an interest in your treatment and do not dwell on your resentments . you will be yourself again , i assure you .
. . . i see .
we will talk more about this . i will see you later .
harry ? oh harry , i knew you would come . i love you , harry . i love . . . take me home , harry .
we will get you home , frances .
this is the answer a subscription drive to voice of action ! first prize is a trip to moscow ! you could visit the art theatre , maybe even meet stanislavski !
but i will never win that .
yes , yes , it is all arranged . everyone s collecting subscriptions in your name . and the best part is the trip returns you to new york .
really ?
new york , frances ! broadway ! this is your chance ! you belong on the stage !
. . . until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution . were you mentally ill , frances ?
were you an alcoholic ?
no .
were you a drug addict ?
thank you , ralph .
bye , baby .
i am . . . i am really proud of you , frances .
thanks , dad .
an essay contest . . . a national contest . that is pretty impressive .
i did not have much to do with it .
you wrote it , did not you ?
yeah , i suppose . . . dad , who s harry york ?
well , harry york is a guy who . . . well , he does a lot of things . why do you ask ?
he talked to me today . told me to keep my mouth shut or i would get everybody in trouble .
yeah . . . well . . . it is possible . harry york and i both work for mr . kaminski right now , and . . . well . . . there are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break . that is the way of things , but mr . kaminski wants to change it , and when it comes to new ideas , the people in power get nervous .
is kaminski a communist ?
no , no , no . all he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation .
it is already started , dad . . . with me .
i know .
dad , please , do not leave early . just because of mama
what do i do , dad ?
you really want to go ?
of course .
and you think it is worth all this ?
if i did not , i would not put you through it .
i love you , mama . i love you , dad .
. . . so what do you think ?
i do not know , honey . your mother has such big plans for you .
i know that , dad , but
what you have to understand , francie , is that she . . . well . . . she wanted so much for herself too , and for me , and she never really got to . . . the only time i ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers . . . but she could have been . . . if times were different she could have been a politician or . . . i do not know .
but dad , i am asking about me . what do you think i should do ?
well , francie , sometimes after you get your hands on something you want , it just does not look the same . then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it is all you have got . . . or just let it go . this is the way of things , but i guess you already know that .
dad . . . whatever i decide , will it be okay with you ?
i am sorry , i . . . i do not have a desk in my room , and . . .
i do not care , dad . i love you .
francie , you know i cannot do that .
why ? it is such a simple thing . you just let me out and i disappear down a road and you never have to see me again .
dad , here ! you do not have to stop , just slow down . you can tell mama i jumped out . she knows that is the kind of thing i would do . she will not blame you .
you know where you are taking me . you know what she will do . just give me a minute , slow down , give me an instant for once in your life , please ?
please , francie . . .
are you . . . are you hungry ?
it always amazes me , lil , how you can whip up a hot , hearty meal out of thin air .
bread ?
thank you .
you are poisoning that child s mind .
i have a right to talk to her . she is my daughter , and she is beginning to understand why i have sacrificed so much in order to achieve . . .
you have sacrificed ? ! if you would practice law for decent folk instead of communists and indigents
they need help , lil . they pay me back in other ways .
how ? what do they do for you , kaminski and his friends ? they are all anarchists ! traitors !
no , lil . it is just you cannot understand their brand of patriotism .
i am going back to the hotel .
good .
see you next weekend ?
lillian . . . i am more than willing to meet you halfway .
do not make me sick . i would sooner drown myself in puget sound .
kurt !
oh , angela ! go with these trappers ! they will lead you safely down the mountain . . .
but , kurt , i . . .
no , no arguments . be my good girl and go . there s a forest , a burning forest , and you know what i have to do !

i am causing trouble ? ! you are a pain in the butt ! you newshounds have been after me and my folks ever since i won that dumb contest . i am just sixteen , you know ? who the hell cares what i think ?
not me . but other people seem to .
yeah . well if you did not put it in the papers nobody would even know about it .
now wait a minute , sweetie . do i look like a newshound to you ?
i will . . . take your word for it . so who are you , then ?
harry york . i work for martoni kaminski , he is running for congress here .

yeah , well
you know , my dad s done some work for kaminski . . .
now you are catching on . do not wanna get your daddy in hot water , do you ?
whattaya mean ?
well . . . see the papers have got us pegged as pinkos , then you come along , the friendly neighborhood atheist
but i am not . the newspapers are
right again . you are no more an atheist than my mangs a red , but what they are doing , see , they are adding up their version of your ideas with their version of ours . could look bad for your daddy .
sure do not talk like you are sixteen .
well are not you the smoothie . now you are going to ask for my number , i suppose .
i suppose not . gotta ask you this , though for all our sakes , you better keep your trap shut .
well . . . i will give it a try , mr . york .
harry .
hi , harry . did you see the play ?
you think i would miss it ?
well ? what would you think ?
i just wanted to see how you looked .
how would i look ?
enh .
do not be a rat , harry .
honest . when you were up there , you were really . . . there , know what i mean ? everyone else looked stupid .
i do not know . . . i did . . . feel different . . . alive .
yeah , it is a gift . you gotta do something with it .
yeah , but if i win this trip , mama will kill me . she hates russians . i do want to go , though . . . to new york , especially . . . but i wanted to do it . . .
what ?
quietly .
you know , my old man was an inventor . spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads , stuff like that . well , i was supposed to be his partner . when i told him the smell of his workshop made me sick , i thought he was going to die right there .
what happened to him ?
i kick myself sometimes , but the thing is , i would have been miserable living his life .
. . . so you think i should go .
sure . try this acting thing . you can make good money at it .
i do not know , harry . i . . . i want so many . . .
you do not know what you want .
frances . . .
what ?
well . . . do not you think it is up to me to . . .
how ya doing , farmer ?
me ? look at you ! what are you doing in hollywood ?
not bad . but come on , harry that is the real reason ?
kaminski .
yeah , i read about that . terrible business , suicide .
since when do you believe the papers ? they killed him , kid .
what ?
they killed him . they threw him out that window .
oh no . . .
jesus .
yup . poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he could not die . too god damn much heart . he just did not want to die .
but . . . but why , harry . . . ? why would they do it ?
he would not play ball . what can i tell ya . . . it is done . anyway , i did not want to be next , so i skipped town came down here to work for some big wig . tail and nail job . i am sort of a non gentlemangs non gentleman . how d ya like the camouflage ?
not bad . it was slow at first , but i am doing bits now .
i always told ya , frances . you got real ability .
i know what ability you are interested in .
hey , i am a man , are not i ? whattaya say we have dinner , then maybe head out to the beach , rub some of this tan off each other . for old time s sake .
harry . . . i met someone .
serious , huh ?
yeah .
shit . i meant the other way around .
well , the studio told me not to .
is that why you did it ?
who ever thought they would be right for once ? jesus , harry . . . it is a zoo back there
you are telling me .
dick . . . and my mother ! she acts like she is on mars or something
well , she is back to earth now . they are all pretty huffed up about your leaving . i think you better go back , kid .
you know , the funny thing is it is not a great movie . i mean it could have been , but they screwed it up , gave it a happy ending . and all my friends , i know they are going to smile and say they loved it .
if they say they love it , they will probably love it . not everybody lies , you know ?
frances , you are a movie star now . if you give them what they want , you can get anything .
i do not have what they want , harry . harry , will you tell me something ? how can i keep making movies when people in the streets are starving ?
some people starve , kid . until we can do something about it , they might as well see a movie . makes em feel better .
but i do not want to be like that . i want to do something . . .
what are you gonna do , waste your talent ? why not use it to make something worthwhile . you can do that , you know ?
tell you what . let s ditch the limo . let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up chevy .
the hell you will , harry york .
do not start , farmer .
it is midnight , harry . my glittering raiments are dissolving .
the chauffeur . he is watching .
he deserves a show . he missed the movie .
i am serious , frances . this is important .
harry ? harry , where are you ? !
jesus , frances , how would you find me ?
i called your god damned office ! i want you to kill him , harry . you will do that for me , will not you ? i loved him , i loved him . . . that bastard .
calm down , frances .
two lines ! two fucking lines ! my wife returns from europe tomorrow . i cannot see you any more . just like that !
frances . . .
how the hell do you find me anyway ?
animal magnetism ! no ginger beer . that is this red stuff ?
that is left of my blood .
think i will have a glass .
nice joint . can you afford it ?
nope . the studio pays . thank you , harry .
what for ?
for not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter .
six months probation . . . ? you gotta learn when to do battle , farmer . you are not going to win many bouts with pound cops .
i took the early rounds .
i will bet .
i do not know . it hurts , harry . some things , no matter what you do with them , they just hurt .
so you drink , and you fight with a cop . . . ?
yeah , and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are , that is going on inside their heads . sometimes you can hear it , like a buzzing , the things that happen in their heads . and you wonder does anybody ever love anybody , really ?
hey look , i got some business down in san diego . whattaya say you come with me , stay a few days ?
no , harry , i cannot
i just wanted to be part of something . . . one thing , one play or one movie , something that was really fine . . . memorable . and i could say i did that , i made something good .
and ?
take a walk , pal .
oh my god , i look awful .
evening , gorgeous .
that sure looks like fun . . . you know how long it is been since i was behind the wheel ?
forget it , frances . you are not driving .
where are we , mean man ?
couple hours from idaho . we will cut across to montana . i have got friends there with a ranch .
i should have known . . .
what ?
this is another one of your schemes to get me off alone . . .
that is right .
i do not think i would be much good in a war . . .
whattaya think you are in now ?
i do not know . not a war exactly . it is more a . . . a misapprehension maybe . . .
huh ?
harry , i have to go home . i have to talk to mama .
frances , you are fulla drugs . you do not know what you are saying . who do you think put you into meadow wood ? your mother thinks you are crazy and she will keep on thinking it as long as it suits her .
no , she just did not want me going to jail , that is all .
you know something , harry ?
i guess .
aside from meanness , you are almost perfect . there s only one other thing wrong with you .
that is that ?
ohhh , that is lousy scotch !
hey ! another shot for the lady and a double for me !
what a man !
hey , you are a good quarter horse , kid , but you cannot go a route of ground .
to quarter horses .
why are you always leaving me , harry ?
huh ?
you should stickaround sometimes . look out for me .
look , frances , i am only gonna ask this one time . i mean it . i swear after this , i will never ask again will you marry me ?
i know a thing or two about marriage . you . . . you understand me more than anyone , harry . . . maybe even more than mama . but . . . you are too important to me . i would fail you . i do not know how or why , but i would . and that is a chance i just cannot take . do you understand ?
there s just one more thing .
that is that ?
it is not too late to keep going , up to vancouver ? be the smartest thing .
thanks , harry , really , but . . . i cannot explain it . she is my mother . she is just . . . i cannot give up on her that easy .
you give up on her ?
yeah . it is just . . . something i gotta do , i guess .
frances , you are crazy .
anyway . . . if you need me . . .
frances ! frances !
who ?
frances , it is me , harry ?
i love you , harry . i love you .
where to ?
this is it , kid . this is our chance . when you got a chance , you better take it .
yeah . i do not know .
you do not need to screw around anymore . you do not need dwayne steele or odets or your mother . you need me .
been a lot of years , you know . a long time waiting . for what ? end up feeling like a sap .
oh please , harry . . . do not even think it . you are the only person who ever . . . it is just . . . cannot you wait for me ?
i do not know .
yes you do . if you love me you can wait , right ? a month , six months , whatever it takes .
right . except . . . time has a way of
no , harry , it is not time , it is us . you and me . and i am telling you now that i will come to you , okay ? i will find you . i will .
c mere . i want to talk to you .
how . . . how ya doing , farmer ?
fine , thank you . did you watch the show ?
sure i did , that is why i am here .
how did i look ?
oh , you . . . . . . ennh .
i got a new car . only it is red . did you know mama died ?
yeah . yeah , i heard about that .
dad , too . i sold the house . i am a faceless sinner , harry . . .
why do you say that ?
it is going to be slow from now on . do you know what i mean , harry ?
i am not sure .
very slow . but we are not going to stop , are we ?
no .
goodbye , harry . it was very good to see you again .
yes . would you like me to walk a little way with you ?
that would be okay .
pretty morning .
it is always beautiful at this time . peaceful . . .
and no people .
where you going ?
wherever they are going , i am going .
yeah , i know what that is like . . . where you been ?
yeah .
what would you do ?
shit !
. . . is that not true ?
who s writing this guy s lines ?
answer the question ! have you driven a car since you were placed on probation ?
no , i could not get my hands on one .
have you reported to your probation officer as directed ?
i never saw him . why did not he show up ?
did you expect him to look you up ?
you are on your way to a contempt citation , young lady .
that is fine with me . . . get it ? fine . a fine ! hey c mon , c mon , what is this , an audience or a jury ?
miss farmer , is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night ?
sure it is true . i was fighting for my country as well as myself .
miss farmer ! in light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation , coupled with the unwarranted assault on the plaintiff here . . . i am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of days in the county jail .
fine !
what happened ? who are you ?
who are you ?
i live here .
you are farmer ? oh . . . well , look , they took your stuff out . moved it to some hotel , i think .
what ?
and that is the title of this seduc . . . assault ?
that is me , clifford .
i am not !
yes , you win them , you bring them into your heart , touch them , but you do not set them on fire !
but i want to . i am trying !
i need an incendiary ! an arsonist !
then show me ! that is what i am here for , to learn , to grow !
but how do i know you love me ?
your big speech ?
how do i know it is true ? you will get to be the champ . they will all want you , all the girls ! but i do not care . i have been undersea a long time . when they would put their hands on me i used to say , this is not it ! this is not what i mean ! it is been a mysterious world for me ! but joe , i think you are it ! i do not know why , i think you are it . take me home with you .
how is it sound ?
the speech ? real good .
you think i got it ?
you got it .
mama . . .
do not listen to him , little sister . when you are proud of what you are , you do not refuse the label , understand ?
yes , ma .
but they are using you !
i will pay your way to new york . i will work , i will slave . i will sell my vegetables to the truck farmers , or
it is not in your hands , mama . it is my life .
yes , but important people are concerned about this . judge hillier spoke to alma styles
i do not care .
it is okay .
it is alright now , little sister , everything s going to be just fine .
mama , that is . . .
shhh , shhh . you are not going to jail , frances . the judge has put you under my care . i will see you get the rest you need .
tell them who i am ! tell them who i am !
and here s one from nice mr . zeiss . he says that . . .
why are these all opened ?
well , they needed immediate answers , frances . it is good manners and good sense . you should not be bothering yourself with these right now .
then why did you bring them ?
it is your fan mail , little sister .
you kill me , mama .
what ?
well , who have we here . . . ?
oh mama , i am so . . . tired of that song .
i think i need a little air .
that is wrong ?
nothing . i think i will just go out for awhile .
where are you going ?
how long will you be ?
i will have lunch ready by one .
i will be back .
at one . promise ?
say you promise .
you know , the surest way to lose an appetite , is to drink , little sister .
yes , mama .
i do not want you drinking , frances .
i am back , mama .
oh frances , do i have news for you ! guess who
do not . . . talk crazy .
mama . . . ?
have not you heard what i said ?
i told him to come up ! i told him you wanted to show them all that there s nothing wrong with you any more , that you are completely cured !
i am not cured . i was never sick ! they had no business putting me in there ! my only responsibility is to myself now !
you . . . you selfish , selfish child . at least talk to him , hear what he has to say .
no !
you want to throw it all away , is that it ? you had everything , little sister . beauty . . . a brilliant career . . . a wonderful husband . you were a movie star !
mama , shut up !
and now you are throwing everything away ? you are gonna be a nobody ! nobody ! you know what that is like ? !
where are you going ?
i am going out !
you are not going anywhere !
yes , i am , and you cannot stop me ! you cannot tell me what to do , mother . i am a grown woman , and i can decide about my own life .
of course , she has not anything definite in mind .
oh , just leave those things for now .
you know , little sister , i never resented you for refusing to see me in the . . . the hospital . i knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back .
little sister , i do not want you to feel any rush to get back to work . i want you to rest . . . for a while anyway .
do i go right away or do i have time to take a bath ?
i was hoping for a kind word , little sister .
you were hoping for a kind word ? ! you are my mother ! you are supposed to nourish me ! support me !
no ! all you have done is try to break my spirit , try to turn me into you ! but i am not you , mother , and i never will be , and thank god for it ! that goes for you too ! and frankly , i do not know how , with the two of you , i turned out as sane as i am wait right there , gentlemen , i will be with you in a minute . . . and believe me , i do not want to stay here one second longer than i have to ! but i have got to tell you , lillian , that one day before you die , you will realize what you have done and hang your head in shame . in shame !
but what
on behalf of the seattle ladies club , as a token of our vast admiration
excuse me .
yes . . . ?
do not i know you ?
i do not believe so .
sure . you shouted at me in the auditorium when i read my essay .
no , my dear . you must be mistaken .
i find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance .
am i supposed to say thank you ?
thanks are hardly necessary .
aw , shucks , ma am . t were not nothing .
i am glad to see you have not lost your sense of humor .
it ai not for lack of trying .
so it seems . may we be serious for a moment ?
oh ! are you really ?
do you expect me , for one moment , to believe you have greater insight into my personality than i do ?
please sit down . . .
you may discuss my predicament , doctor . you may discuss it with anyone you like , but not with me . i am not interested . i can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian .
i see .
besides , i do not want to be what you want to make me .
and that is that ?
normal . average .
all right . will you please sit down now ? symington says .
. . . did you really say that ?
just a little joke , miss farmer .
this whole thing is a joke !
stay calm , please .
no , you stay calm , doctor ! but you are finding that difficult , are not you ? why , are you attracted to me ? perhaps later , in some of our more intimate sessions . . . after we know each other a little better . . . and you have torn my personality to shreds , and i am weeping and vulnerable . . . then you will really get your kicks , will not you , doctor ?
i will have someone show you to your room .
is there something else ?
. . . i am sorry to keep you waiting , the staff review ran over . did you enjoy your mother s visit ?
yes . it was very good to see her .
not at all . she brought me my fan mail . i had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me . but i guess that is the best thing about working in the movies . you make so many friends . i want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me was not a mistake .
you are telling me you feel guilty .
no . . . what i mean is . . . i am just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life , that is all .
do you really believe your mother s trying to kill you ?
what ?
she told me you said , mama , you want to kill me .
i never said . . . oh look . that is just a figure of speech . she said something funny , and i said . . .
and you accused her of tampering with your mail .
i am sorry . she misunderstood , that is all .
but you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative . whom do you think i should believe ?
doctor , i hate to break this to you , but my mother is a little batty .
frances , you are still filled with anxiety . you feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends . consequently , i did not recommend your release at the staff review .
you what ?
i am sure you will see it my way in the end .
dr . symington , how big is your dick ?
huh ?
i want outta here , you understand ? i am ready to get out ! so you go back there . . . you go back and you tell them to let me out !
frances , i am warning you . . .
symington says . . .
and do you think it is radical for a man to have a job and feed a family ?
no !
is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future , and the future of your children ?
no !
is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country ?
no ! no !
i do not know why they even bother . she is had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant .
yeah ?
i checked the files . this one holds the record for shock treatments . four hundred seventeen and no end in sight .
you are kidding .
yeah , well , you know doctors . they sure hate to use that word .
what ?
you were with him at the end .
yes .
i longed to be with him . but i wanted his final moments to have peace . i could see you were a friend to him .
what is that to you ? evil as you are .
i am as he made me . in his own image .
you drove him to his torment .
and he drove me to mine .
then why weep for him ?
i have never been shown a kindness . show me one now .
what kindness ?
nice .
i am glad you finally came to the door . a man should not have to scurry in the shadows .
better that way . . . for me .
why ?
i am . . . very , very ugly . people are afraid . except you .
it cannot be as bad as that .
you are an outcast .
yes . i have been seeking my friends .
friends ? do they live around here ?
yes . very close
i have been . . . afraid . afraid . . . they will hate me . . . because i am so very ugly . . . and they are so very beautiful
people can be kinder than you think .
come warm yourself if you like .
you speak .
yes , i speak . and read . and think . . . and know the ways of man . i have been waiting for you . two months now .
the letters in your journal . that and a geography book . your elizabeth sounds lovely .
kill me and have done with it .
kill you ? hardly that .
then why am i here ? what did you want with me ?
more to the point , why am i here ? what did you want with me ? what does one say to one s maker , having finally met him face to face ? milton gave it voice . did i request thee , maker , from my clay to mould me man ? did i solicit thee from darkness to promote me ?
fine words from a child killer . you who murdered my brother .
your crime . . . as well as mine .
how dare you . you are disgusting and evil .
evil ? do you believe in evil ?
i see it before me .
why , victor ? why ? what were you thinking ?
there was something at work in my soul which i do not understand .
what of my soul ? do i have one ? or was that a part you left out ? who were these people of which i am comprised ? good people ? bad people ?
materials . nothing more .
in which part of me did this knowledge reside ? in these hands ? in this mind ? in this heart ? and reading and speaking . not things learned . . . so much as things remembered .
trace memories in the brain , perhaps .
stolen memories . stolen and hazy . they taunt me in my dreams . i have seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her . whose woman was this ? i have seen boys playing , splashing about in a stream . whose childhood friends were these ? who am i ?
i do not know .
what can i do ?
there is something i want . a friend .
friend ?
a companion . a female . like me , so she will not hate me .
like you ? oh , god , you do not know what you are asking .
i do know that for the sympathy of one living being , i would make peace with all . i have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine . and rage the likes of which you would not believe . if i cannot satisfy the one , i will demonically indulge the other . that choice is yours . you are the one who set this in motion , frankenstein .
and if i consent ?
soon ?
yes . i want this over and done with .
why . . . her ?
what is this ?
a brain . extremities .
this was not taken from a grave .
what does it matter ? she will live again . you will make her .
you will honor your promise to me !
i will not ! kill me now !
she is beautiful .
she is not for you .
get away from her ! she is mine !
poor william ! what indignant tears !
that is the nature of all progress , william . do not let your brother sway you otherwise .
elizabeth , really ! he is quite mad !
scandalous ! what would your dear mother say ?
you dance so beautifully together .
must have been a terrible row .
nothing . still nothing .
it is been months . it is not like him .
something s wrong . i know it . i have heard rumors of cholera spreading south from hamburg .
so have i
i should go . i should leave today .
elizabeth . if it is true , travel into germany would be banned . you would never get near ingolstadt . besides , they are only rumors .
and not a word of them to father . he is agitated enough not hearing from victor .
are you all right ?
he always was opinionated .
what does it say ?
have you seen willie ?
is he not back yet ?
claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time . they say he never arrived .
do not cry , elizabeth .
are you sure it cannot hurt us ?
how could all my father s knowledge and skill fail to save her ?
what kind of god is he to will this ?
she was mother to me as well . but ours is the job of the living . it is up to us now to hold this family together . we must think of father and be strong for him . i cannot do that alone .
god took her from us .
victor , have a care ! you will make him dizzy !
oh , do give him here ! he needs to be comforted and held !
do not listen , willie . progress is a feast to be consumed . women would have you believe you must walk before you can run . or run before you can waltz !
smell the air . wonderful .
quite a send off , is not it ?
father s so proud .
and you ?
prouder still . you will be the handsomest student there .
i will have to do better than that .
you will . what do you want , victor ?
i have loved you all my life
this feels . . . incestuous .
brother and sister still ?
i wish to be your husband .
i wish to be your wife .
then come with me to ingolstadt . marry me now .
if only i could . but one of us must stay . father s not strong . willie s just a child . who can look after them in your absence ? who can run the estate ?
only you .
you make me weak .
our decision . together .
your decision . for us .
i give you my soul . . .
. . . until our wedding night . when our bodies will join .
victor . i love you ,
my mind was not playing tricks . he was there in the storm . . . gloating over his crimes . . . challenging me to come .
but why risk yourself ? has not this family suffered enough ?
i have no choice
if what you say is true , it is a matter for the police !
do you know this man ? is there something between you ?
i thought i would never see you again !
what sort of task ?
it is not something i can explain now . perhaps someday .
what of our marriage ? victor , we have had so much tragedy . i want this family to live again .
so do i .
we need each other now , i need your comfort and strength , not separation and solitude .
no . not tomorrow , not next week , marry me today .
why the change ? what about your work ?
it was misguided and pointless . is your answer yes ?
it is
we will leave this afternoon , right after the ceremony . pack only what you need .
does this have something to do with that man you saw ?
yes . we are in danger here . every moment we stay .
victor , tell me why ! trust me !
brother and sister no more .
i remember the first time i ever saw you . crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side . so beautiful even then .
victor !
it is going to ram us .
captain , i implore you . the men are frightened and angry . they want your assurance .
they knew the risks when they signed on . i have come too far to turn back now .
a warming wind .
this ice will break yet . how is our guest ?
he died . raving about phantoms . he was mad , poor devil . gather a detail . have the body removed from my cabin .
i am quite serious . look at all the charity and clinic work we do . up until thirty years ago , the concept of vaccine was unheard of .
you are saying all disease will eventually be eradicated ?
i am convinced . not by treating symptoms , but by diving nature s most jealously guarded secrets .
do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes ?
no . but someday .
professor ?
i was just clearing my throat .
i am not mad .
are you having me on ?
henry clerval .
victor , victor frankenstein .
do you really think i am mad ?
rich old ladies and their daughters ?
can you think of a better reason ?
quite a few .
the entire school heard it . it was not something one could miss .
you are a comfort to me , henry .
what now ? writing about it in your journal will not help .
now you have got him started .
these are exciting times , henry . we are entering an era of amazing breakthroughs . look at edward jenner . he was not content to bleed people with leeches , he pioneered a new frontier of thought
. . . yes , and thanks to him , smallpox has been virtually eliminated . i have heard this speech before .
only you would think of that !
and here s to him . everything in moderation , frankenstein .
they just caught the man who did it .
he was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance .
they will hang him all the same .
keep your voice down . you do not know what you are saying .
you are making a scene !
why waldman ? he of all people should have cheated death !
you cannot . death is god s will !
i resent god s monopoly .
that is blasphemy !
blasphemy be damned ! waldman spent his life trying to help people !
all the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor !
no . he had more important work .
victor . this has got to stop . nobody s seen you in months . you have not attended a single class .
i have been preoccupied .
we all know how hard you took waldmangs death . even krempe is sympathetic . but it is time to move on . it is time to concern yourself with life .
that is my concern . i am involved in something just now . i want to finish it in waldmangs memory .
how much longer ?
this is a bad time , henry . i am busy just now . what do you want ?
things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak . thousand new cases a day now . classes have been suspended . university s shut down .
yes ? and ?
listen to what i am saying . the militia s arriving to quarantine the city . most of us are getting out while we still can .
thank god your fever broke . slowly , now . just a sip . i have been worried we might lose you . it is been touch and go for a week .
a . . . week ?
we feared cholera . turned out to be pneumonia , brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm .
is that your diagnosis ?
mine and professor krempe s . we have been trading off nursing you in shifts . the rest of the time we are out working with the cholera victims . it is his turn for that just now .
you have been going round the clock ?
we catch a few hours sleep where we can . usually here at your bedside .
everything in moderation , clerval .
it is the down and outs i pity most . those who cannot fend for themselves . they will be dead by the thousands before this is done . they do not stand a chance out there .
no . they do not .
quite a place .
thank you , henry .
for what ?
what happened up there ?
are you sure you will be all right ?
yes , do not worry . i will look after your father . you look after her .
i will be back as soon as i have got her far away and safe . we will hunt this fiend down together .
only if you will tell me who he is .
all that i once loved lies in a shallow grave . by my hand .
yes . i took refuge in the barn . would not you ? lost in the storm ? freezing and wet ? i was exhausted and could search no longer .
i have always loved him .
is it also not true that you murdered his brother william in a misdirected crime of passion ?
murder willie ? in my heart , he was our child . victor s and mine . such a thing could never have entered my mind .
so you have claimed . yet you have no explanation for this . the locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder . the locket you so coveted . how did it come to be in your possession ?
in science , the letter of fact is the letter of law . our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept . think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect . someday you may be priests . . . but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse . any questions ?
but surely , professor , you do not intend we disregard the more . . . philosophical works .
philosophical ?
paracelsus ?
or albertus magnus . cornelius agrippa . . .
what is your name ?
victor frankenstein , sir . of geneva .
you seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum .
professor waldman .
victor , explain yourself .
krempe has a way of provoking my temper .
you have a way of provoking his . i have been watching you . you seem impatient with your studies .
to say the least . i came here to expand my mind , but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn . all we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new .
you disdain accepted wisdom ?
preposterous .
electricity .
it is utterly fantastic ! this is the sort of thing i am talking about ! we should be learning this !
why ? god alone knows what it means . until it has proven value , it is nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick . hardly fit for the classroom .
but the possibilities . combining ancient knowledge with new ? something like this could change our fundamental views !
it is a thrilling direction to explore . thrilling and dangerous . nature can be wonderful and terrible . science is not a realm for the reckless it needs a conscience . we must proceed cautiously . assess as we go . what i do on my own time is my own business . the same holds true for you . you wish to expand your mind ? fine , do so . you can even join me here , if you like . but not at the expense of your normal studies .
i doubt that decision is still mine to make .
. . . a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty .
why ?
re configure the leads ?
victor . he was trying to be gracious .
i tell you what we need , my friends . forget the symptoms and diseases . what we need is a vaccine for death itself .
you are awake . i have prepared some broth . it will help restore you .
frostbite . gangrene . a simple diagnosis .
are you a physician ?
how is it you come to be here ?
there s a startling question , coming from you . i am captain of this ship . we sailed from archangel a month ago , seeking a passage to the north pole .
ah . an explorer .
would be . i am plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment .
i heard .
i cannot say i blame them . we are trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of . . . creature .
creature ? a . . . human like creature ?
you know of it ?
your men are right to be afraid .
then explain it , whatever it is . it could save the voyage . i have spent years planning this . my entire fortune .
you would persist at the cost of your own life ? the lives of your crew ?
do you share my madness ?
we are kindred , you and i . men of ambition . let me tell you all that i have lost in such pursuits . i pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man .
who are you ?
he is dead . . . she is dead . . . all dead . . . please save me . . . oh . . . poor bill . . . oh my god , oh my god . . . oh god . . .
it will be all right . i will take care of you .
it is just this place . the storm . that is why you are all upset .
so young , so pretty . what monster could have done such a thing ?
the killer is still out there .
we should go now .
what would you see ?
shows how much you know . it is something about tomorrow .
tomorrow is another day .
melvin belli .
i think we should go wake them up . just in case .
give them a little while longer . it is still early , anyway .
good night , alice .
cabin b is ready .
that is got her . thanks . i am steve christy . welcome to camp crystal lake . you got some grubby clothes ? climb into em . alice , see if bill has cleaned out the boathouse . i want him to start with the canoes . what happened to brenda ?
you draw very well .
any particular reason ?
just a feeling . nothing personal .
you want to leave ?
i do not know . probably be best for everybody .
next friday .
i have got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff , but i will be back around ten . if you are still up , we can talk , okay ?
steve said for you to start on the boats .
alice ? the others show up ?
you think you are gonna last all summer ?
steve said you were thinking of leaving . true ?
oh , my god . . .
how come you are leaving ?
it is long and personal . it has nothing to do with you or the other kids .
and it is this place . it makes no sense , but it spooks me .

i thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures . ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do , you know .

you said it was just you and your son .
i meant me , my son and my daughter .
whatsamatter with you ? are you crazy ?
why the fuck , outta all the god forsaken shit holes in mexico , did you have us rendezvous at that place ?
i do not know , one place s as good as another .
have you ever been there before ?
no , but i passed by it a couple of times . it is out in the middle of nowhere . it seems like a rowdy place , so there would not be a lot of police . and it is open from dusk till dawn . you said meet you in the morning .
i am sorry to hear that . what were they , psychos ?
oh , seth , how can i ever make it up to you ?
you cannot , but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at el ray is a good start .
twenty eight .
you like the car ?
i said new , this is an .
it is hardly been used at all . i got it from a drug dealer who only drove it times in as many years . swear to god . that is like new .
so do i just follow you ?
yeah , follow us .
so let s do it .
we got about two more hours of day light left . that will get us into el paso , which is right next to the border . we will stop at a motel
unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking , what say we drop this ?
why do you want to stop ?
i am exhausted .
that is this guy s problem ?
what are you gonna do ?
i am gonna try and get us across the border .
have you forgotten about your sister ?
they are gonna kill us . they get us across the border , they are gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us .
if they get over the border , they are gonna let us go .
dad , i watch those reality shows . they never let anybody go . any cop will tell you , in a situation like this , you get a chance , you go for it . this is our chance .
what about kate ?
they are gonna kill her anyway . at least now with all these cops we have got a fighting chance .
son , i have this situation under control . i know exactly what i am doing . you are going to have to trust me on this .
now , you listen to me . you ai not gonna do a goddamn fucking thing , you hear me ! nobody cares what you think , i am running this show , i make the decisions .
he is running the show .
you do not believe in suicide .
it is not suicide if you are already dead . two . . .
okay , i will kill you when you change , i swear to god in jesus christ s name .
why did they block the door again ?
that is your name ?
jacob .
that is the story with you two ? you a couple of fags ?
he is my son .
how does that happen ? you do not look japanese .
neither does he . he looks vietnamese .
oh , well , excuse me all to hell .
that is this about , money ?
it is okay , honey . everything s going to be all right .
where are the keys to the motor home ?
on the dresser .
not a chance .
come again ?
if you are taking people , take me . but my kids are not going anywhere with you .
sorry , i need everybody .
my children are not going with you , and that is that .
yes .
jacob fuller . jacob , that is biblical , ai not it ? what am i asking for , of course it is . what are their names ?
who s this ?
my wife .
where is the little lady ?
in heaven .
she is dead ?
yes , she is .
how would she die ?
auto wreck .
come on , gimme some more details . how would it happen ? some fucking drunk kill her ?
no . it was a rainy night , the brakes on the car were not great . she had to stop suddenly . she slid on the road , she crashed , she died .
died instantly ?
not quite . she was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on .
whewww ! those acts of god really stick it in and break it off , do not they ?
is this real ?
yes .
i have seen one of these before . a friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion . away to fuck the irs . is that what you are doing , or are you the real mccoy ?
real mccoy .
you are a preacher ?
i was a minister .
was ? as in not anymore ?
yes .
why would ya quit ?
i think i have gotten about as up close and personal with you as i am gonna get . now if you need me like i think you need me , you are not gonna kill me cause i will not answer your stupid , prying questions . so , with all due respect , mind your own business .
i seem to have touched a nerve . do not be so sensitive , pops , let s keep this friendly . but you are right , enough with the getting to know you shit . now , there s two ways we can play this hand . one way is me and you go round ang round all fucking night . the other way , is we reach some sort of an understanding . now , if we go down that first path at the end of the day , i will win . but we go down the second , we will both win . now , i do not give a rat s ass about you or your fucking family . y all can live forever or die this second and i do not care which . the only things i do care about are me that son of a bitch in the back , and our money . and right now i need to get those three things into mexico . now , stop me if i am wrong , but i take it you do not give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice , or the bank getting its money back . right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter , your son and possibly yourself . am i correct ?
yes .
i thought so . you help us get across the border without incident , stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny , and in the morning we will let you and your family go . that way everybody gets what they want . you and your kids get out of this alive and we get into mexico . everybody s happy .
how do i know you will keep your word ?
jesus christ , pops , do not start with this shit .
you want me to sit here and be passive . the only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if i believe you will let us go . i am not there yet . you have to convince me you are telling the truth .
look , dickhead , the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you are stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters . i do not wanna hafta worry about you all fucking night . and i do not think you wanna be worrying about my brother s intentions toward your daughter all night . you notice the way he looked at her , did not ya ?
yes .
did not like it , did ya ?
no , i did not .
did not think so . so , as i was saying , i am willing to make a deal . you behave , get us into mexico , and do not try to escape . i will keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning .
you will not let him touch her ?
if he touches her , i will kill him . i do not give a fuck how many guns you have , nothing will stop me from killing him .
swear to god , on the bible , you will not try to escape and you will get us across the border .
i swear to god i will not try to escape and i will do my best to get you into mexico .
i am telling you , do not hurt her .
as long as you are cool , she will be cool . what are ya gonna say ?
i do not have the slightest idea .
we did our part , we gotcha in mexico . now it is time for your part , letting us go .
then ?
out of the stew pot and into the fire .
who else ?
pass .
why not , against your religion ?
no , i do drink , i am just not drinking now .
why are you so agitated ?
i am still stewing about that ape laying hands on me . and that fucking bartender sticks a weed up my ass , too .
he backed down .
he is smiling at us . but behind his smile , he is saying , fuck you jack . i hear that loud and clear .
what are you going to do ?
i am gonna just sit here and drain this bottle . and when i have drunk the last drop , if i still feel then , the way i feel now , i am gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head .
before we stepped in here , you told all of us to be cool . that means you , too .
i never said do what i do , i said do what i say .
what did you call me ?
to your family .
now , is your shit together ?
okay , does anybody here know that is going on ?
you too , preacher ?
i am like you . i do not believe in vampires , but i believe in what i saw .
good for you . now , since we all believe we are dealing with vampires , what do we know about vampires ? crosses hurt vampires . do you have a cross ?
in the winnebago .
i do not know about that . in order for it to have any power , i think it is gotta be an official crucifix .
that is an official cross ? some piece of tin made in taiwan ? what makes that official ? if a cross works against vampires , it is not the cross itself , it is what the cross represents . the cross is a symbol of holiness .
did he . . . ?
you all are gonna fucking die ! i am gonna fucking kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit !
that is this stuff ?
my guess is that this little dive s been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime . this is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks .
well , i say lets tear this place apart for weapons . so when they burst through that door , we will make em wish they never did .
i do not give a shit about living or dying anymore . i just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as i can .
i promise .
it is the bitterest of pills .
you two ought to start a stand up act , because you are just wasting your humor on me .
i just bet you would . do not even think about it . besides , i want to have one night s sleep in an honest to goodness bed . the beds in the home are okay , but they are not like a real bed .
dad , when i called the machine to check our messages there was one from bethel baptist . mr . franklin said he would not permanently replace you until we came back . he said when we come home , if you still feel the same way
that is very nice of ted , but i will call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting .
i did not want to talk about this in front of scott because he gets upset . but you do not believe in god anymore ?
not enough to be a pastor . look , i know this is hard on you kids . after jenny s death , this is probably the last thing you need . but i cannot do it any longer . my congregation needs spiritual leadership . well , they cannot get that from me anymore . my faith is gone . to answer your question , yes , i do believe in jesus . but do i love them ? no . after jenny died , i just thought , that is the point ?
it is just , all our lives you have been a pastor . for twenty years you have preached trust in the lord . and then one day you wake up and say fuck him ?
i did not say fuck him . i am just not connected anymore .
that happens , you will get it back .
kate , give your old man a little credit . every person who chooses the service of god as their life s work has something in common . i do not care if you are a preacher , a priest , a nun , a rabbi or a buddhist monk . many , many times during your life you will look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself , am i a fool ? we have all done it . i am not going through a lapse . what i have experienced is closer to awakening . i am not trying to shake your faith . i have just decided not to devote my life to god anymore .
what do you think mom would say ?
there s nothing wrong with this place .
it is a flop house .
it is not a flop house . it is basic and simple . that does not make it a flop house .
it has a bed . that is all i care about .
about two hours from now .
you are gonna be okay , are not you , daddy ?
i promise .
kate , we do not have all day , so i am only gonna count to five . one . . . two . . . three . . . four . . .
okay , okay , i promise i will do it !
not good enough , swear to god .
i swear to god , our father , that when you change into one of the undead , i will kill you .
i am going for em !
no !
that is going on ?
richie , will you do me a favor and eat my pussy ?
what ?
where are you taking us ?
mexico .
that is in mexico ?
what ?
in the room . were you serious , or were you just fooling around ? i am just bringing it up , cause if you really want me to do that for you , i will .
do what ?
what you said to me in the room .
what did i say ?
creepy guy .
you got three minutes . one second longer , i shoot your father in the face . do you understand what i just said ?
yes .
do you believe me ?
yes .
yeah .
you must have a bible in here , do not cha ?
yeah , we got a bible .
you are gonna let us go ?
how about you , cutie pie ? ready for round two ?
are you okay ?
peachy ! why should not i be ? the world s my oyster , except for the fact that i just rammed a wooden stake in my brother s heart because he turned into a vampire , even though i do not believe in vampires . aside from that unfortunate business , everything s hunky dory .
i am really sorry .
we have to go back for daddy !
daddy s dead .
watch my back !
how many bullets left , kid ?
not many .
should i use the last bullets on us ?
i am sorry .
see ya .
why , just look at all this . you got your kitchen
you got your microwave
you got your sink
you got your shower
see this , television !
for the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty eight hours . the bureau , local law enforcement and the texas rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare seth and richard gecko .
agent chase , does it appear that they are heading for mexico .
yes , it does , kelly . we have already alerted the mexican authorities . they intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice .
are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in abilene , gloria hill ?
we have received no news one way or the other . we can only hope for the best .
what about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot ?
this cannot be confirmed at this time , but we do believe it to be true . we have reason to believe it was the youngest brother richard , and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store s clerk .
is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers , that the bureau , the rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally ?
hot goddamn day !
have not felt it a bit . been inside with the air conditioner blasting all day long .
not even for lunch ?
jesus christ man , that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet . those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed . pull me down a bottle of jack daniels . i am getting tanked tonight .
whatsamatter ?
awww , it is just been a shitass day . every inch of it hot and miserable . first off , nadine at the blue chip got some sorta sick , so that mongoloid boy of hers was working the grill . that fucking idiot do not know rat shit from rice krispies . i ate breakfast at nine , was puking up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty .
is not there a law or something against retards serving food to the public ?
well , if there ai not there sure oughta be . who knows what goes on inside mongoloid s mind ?
you could sue the shit out of her , ya know . that kid belongs under a circus tent , not flipping burgers . you could own that fucking place .
what the hell would i do with that grease pit ? besides , nadine s got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head . then all this abilene shit happened . you heard about that bank robbery in abilene , did not ya ?
that is all that is been on the box all day . they killed some people did not they ?
they will probably make a run for the border , which would bring em this way . and if we get our hands on those shit asses , we are talking payback time . we will get em all right . i gotta piss . i am gonna use your commode .
yeah , and i am gonna be right back at it tomorrow . so tonight i am gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze . how much is the bottle ?
what do you want from me ? i did what you said .
letting him use your toilet ? no store does that .
he comes in here every day and we bullshit . he is used my toilet a thousand times . if i told him no , he would know something was up .
were you giving that pig signals ?
he says you were scratching .
i was not scratching !
i never said help us !
whiskey !
you cannot come in here .
what dya mean ?
this is a private club . you are not welcome .
are you telling me i am not good enough to drink here ?
best in mexico .
what the fuck was that about ?
what the fuck is wrong with you
start the car .
you believe me do not cha ?
richie ? you okay ?
yeah ?
when i count three , shoot out the bottles behind him !
gotcha !
what did i tell you ? what did i tell you ? buy the road map and leave .
what am i supposed to do , seth ? he recognized us .
do they have cable ?
no .
do they have an x rated channel ?
no .
do they have a waterbed ?
how is it feel ?
i got both rooms on either side of us , so we do not gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes . how is that feel ? you okay ?
feels good .
hey , when you talk to him , see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent .
that is their standard deal , brother . they ai not about to change it for us .
did you even to try to negotiate ?
these guys ai not spic firecracker salesman from tijuana . they do not even know the meaning of the word barter . you wanna stay in el ray ? you give them thirty percent of your loot . it is scripture . so it is written , so shall it be done . you want sanctuary , you pay the price , and the price is thirty percent .
all i am saying
shit , i started to get worried . where the fuck ya been ?
sight seeing .
what would ya see ?
cops .
yeah , i saw the border . through binoculars from on top of a high building . that is about as close as i risked getting . that is the tv say ?
i gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border . longer we fuck around el paso our lives ai not worth a shit .
look , fuck the border . let s just dig in and wait for things to cool down .
richie , it is gonna get a lot fucking worse before it gets any fucking better . we showed our ass in texas . we killed texas fucking rangers . they ai not gonna stop looking till they find us , and when they find us , they are gonna kill us . texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers . the el paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us .
how do you know ?
where is the woman ?
what would ya mean , what ? the fucking woman , the hostage . where the fuck is she , richard ! ?
she is in the other room .
yeah , explain it to me . i need an explanation . that is the matter with you ?
there s nothing wrong with me , brother . that woman tried to escape and i did what i had to do .
no . that woman would not of said shit if she had a mouthful .
wrong , wrong , wrong , wrong , wrong , wrong , wrong ! once you left , she became a whole different person .
is it me ? is it my fault ?
is this my fault ? do you think this is what i am ?
what ?
this is not me ! i am a professional fucking thief . i steal money . you try to stop me , god help you . but i do not kill people i do not have to , and i do not rape women . what you doing ai not how it is done . do you understand ?
seth , if you were me
just say yes ! nothing else , just say yes .
yes .
yes , seth , i understand .
richard !
this is not gonna work .
shut up . it is gonna work just fine ,
i just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea .
they are gonna search the van .
as long as you do not act like a fucking nut , we will be just fine .
what does that mean ?
you just called me a fucking nut .
no , i did not .
yes , you did . you said as long as i do not act like a fucking nut , implying that i have been acting like a fucking nut .
take a pill , kid . i just meant stay cool .
this ai not the time , richard .
fuck those spic pigs ! you called me a fucking nut , and where i come from , that stops the train on its tracks .
keep your voice down .
i am curious . what was the nuttiest thing i did ?
this ai not the time .
you okay ?
yeah , i think so . what happened ?
i do not know , you just passed out .
i did ?
yeah , we were just standing there . you said something about your shoulder hurting , then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes .
really ?
yeah , when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard . it scared the shit outta me . sure you are okay ?
yeah , i guess . i am just a little fucked up .
well , let me tell ya something , gonna clear your head right up . we are officially mexicans .
what ?
we are . . . south of the border down mexico way .
we are ?
far out . where are my glasses ?
they broke when you fell .
oh , fuck , seth , that is my only pair !
do not worry about it , we will get you some glasses .
what dya mean , do not worry about it . of course i am gonna worry about it , i cannot fucking see .
when we get to el ray , i will take care of it .
yeah , like a mexican hole in the wall s gonna have my fucking prescription .
that is what you think ?
that is how you are looking , richie .
i am looking scared ?
that is what you look like .
you know what you look like ?
no , richie , what do i look like ?
how ?
where are you right now ?
what do you mean ?
where are you ?
i am here with you .
no , you are not . you are sipping margaritas in el ray . but we are not in el ray . we are here getting ready to go in there . you are so pleased with yourself about getting into mexico , you think the job s down . it ai not . get back on the clock . that is a fuck with you bar . we hang around there for a coupla hours , in all likelihood , we will get fucked with . so get your shit together , brother .
my shit is together .
it do not look together .
earth to richie . do not you wanna ask your new friend to join us ?
yeah .
well , then ask her , dumb ass .
how are you ?
how about you ? you are safer in here with us than wandering around a mexican border town all night long . just do not do nothing stupid and we will all get along fine . scotty , you sure you do not want a drink ?
in that camper out there i saw a guitar . i take it that is yours .
yeah , it is mine .
you could take their head off .
he is right , kate . daddy s dead ! he was too far away . if flinging that door and filling this room with those bat things would save him , i would fling it . the only thing it will do is turn us into one of them .
he needs our help !
b . o . q . , south side . take a starboard tack out the door .
thank you , ensign .
they take you away to san clemente island . half the guys quit when they come back . supposed to be just hell and a half .
that is what i hear .
can i ask you something , lieutenant ? how come you are doing this ? i mean , we are kinda curious .
who s we ?
i do not know if there s any single reason . but my father was navy . and he had this old time recruiting poster in his den . it showed a girl trying on a sailor s uniform while saying , gee , i wish i were a man ! i would join the navy ! was maybe years old when i first saw it , and even then it felt wrong . made me mad . and i do not think a month has gone by that i have not thought about that poster . gee , i wish i were a man .
i have been accused of that wish .
the woman i saw you with . . .
just a friend . we have friends , too , you know .
but are there . . . i mean , how many . . .
administration , ensign blondell .
do not say my name .
who s . . . lieuten
or rank . but can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order ?
okay , but . . . you did not have to do what you did . not for me .
got it .
who signed as his sponsoring officer ?
wow . . .
commander , are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snapping their fill ? these were supposed to have been discreet test cases
senator , they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses
and now i got reporters from toadsquat , iowa , calling my office and asking what i know about this g . i . jane thing .
nothing i can do about it unless you are suggesting i infringe on their civil liberties which i would happily do if you will just trim a little fat off the constitution .
well , seeings how this thing is out , you let me handle the r . p . m . from this point forward , i want all press matters coordinated via my office . i will be god damned if i am gonna watch hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one . him or the president . this my shade ? midnight mahogany ? cuz i am coming dangerously close to looking like ronald reagan here .
your prerogative , senator .
awright . how is our girl doing , anyway ?
standing right here in my office .
uh , v . i . p . security arrangements generally take some time , senator .
security ? what the hell you talking about ? your base is not secure ?
of course , but there s more
yes , of course . please , have a seat , lieutenant . . .
thank you , sir .
would you care for a beverage ? tea ?
i am fine , sir .
so . we are still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this for integrating the spec recon training . it may not always be smooth , but we are trying to make it as painless as possible for you .
barber was my next stop , sir . would have had it regulation sooner , only
do not worry about it . if it is off your collar and out of your eyes , that is all i am going to ask .
really , i have no problem with
i am not out to change your sex , lieutenant . you will have separate beds , separate heads . if you have specific medical needs , inform the infirmary . if a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner , please inform me immediately so i can deal with it immediately . questions ?
none at this time , sir .
sir , i just want you to know . . . i am not here to make a statement . i do not want to make men look foolish . all i care about is completing the training and getting operational experience just like everyone else , i suspect .
pardon the hour , sir . but you told me to come to you immediately if i felt i was being mistreated in any way .
all right , lieutenant , give me a name and specifics , i will have the x . o . file an action first thing in the morning . a name ?
it is you , sir . and it started the day i came here .
oh , really .
it is this double standard , the separate quarters , the deferential treatment . it is how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met .
because i was civil , now you are complaining .
i cannot afford civility , sir . how am i supposed to fit in with these guys when you have got me set up as an outsider ? even if i make it under these rules , i still lose , because there will always be a flag in my file yeah , she made it , but . . . i mean , really why did not you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base ?
did you just have a brain fart ?
pardon ?
did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander ? if so , i regard that as a bonafide brain fart , and i resent it when people fart inside my home .
what i resent , lieutenant , is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment . what i resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men . . . the day care center i have to build where an officer s lounge used to be . . . and the ob gyn i have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears . but most of all , lieutenant , i resent your perfume , however subtle it may be , competing with the aroma of my fine three dollar and fifty nine cent cigar , which i will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities . does it ?
no , sir .
no , sir , what ?
well . least now we are talking the same language . so one standard . is that what you are after ?
same rules for everyone , sir .
straight up ?
across the board , sir .
and if you just happen to wash out , i will not have to contend with you bitching to some hairy chested female senator ? and please note i did not identify any one in particular .
then good night .
so i will get a fair shot ?
see me , sir ?
sir , i want you to know that i had nothing to do with any of this . not this article , not
permission to leave , sir ?
i do not know of any delicate way to say this , lieutenant , so i will not try . claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization of the same sex variety . specifically , that you were . . . . . . seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming .
i am saying , we are just friends .
i find this as distasteful as you , lieutenant . but if it is on my desk , it is on my shoulders . there s going to be an inquiry it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty . you should prepare yourself .
sir , please . . . if there s any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud . . .
sir . if tomorrow . . . i was not under your command . . . would the inquiry still go forward ?
i am not sure what
well , if you had to go over my head , lieutenant , that is the way to do it . christ , nothing like a call from the commander and chief to get the bowels moving .
sir ? what did he say ?
aw , what is this . . .
ah , c mon . . .
fine by me , sir !
newberry , get a photo . south ?
entering my scan now . . .
shit . think we are had .
smoke her .
i ai not gonna shoot her .
only blanks . lemme do it .
banditos on the east perimeter ! yards ! shit , she was part of it !
what , we are gonna pry em out with paddles ?
white house boys want a private meeting .
think i overplayed it ?
yes ?
did you hear ?
she made it through s . e . r . e . training . got a call this morning from
. . . last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service , particularly in the land based maritime specialties . that is more , the navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on
hardly the case , senator .
the lark report .
madam senator . . . this is an internal document of the u . s . navy . i must seriously question whether
the navy s conclusion regarding the crash of an f aboard an aircraft carrier . female aviator , it just so happens . you are familiar with this report and its conclusion , am i right ?
i was one member of the investigating commission .
yes , i see your signature right here twice the size of everyone else s . and your conclusion was pilot error , hmm ?
i am really not prepared for any kind of in depth review of
the commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier .
so everyone i talk to says you are top drawer with silk stockings inside .
thank you , ma am . um , may i ask what this is regarding ?
coronado .
california .
i know that , sir . ma am . it is just that . . . begging your pardon , senator , but . . . do you understand that this involves combat training ?
this is just a test case , o neil . but if it works out if you work out it could well change the navy s official policy on women in combat . or , actually , its official non policy . now who s your immediate superior there ?
captain dwyer . technically .
my office will fill him in and help expedite . look forward to meeting you at the proper time . jumping off now . . .
uh , question , ma am .
yes , dear .
would i be the only one ? the only woman ?
cannot complain , ma am .
hmmm . maybe i will ask when i see you in person .
uh , ma am .
jordan . i always hoped we would get together though just now i am gearing up for a child care vote that
you know him .
sounds familiar .
it should . you nominated him for spec recon just three days after you nominated me .
jordan . might we do this over lunch tomorrow ? i do very much want to talk , but now is scarcely
did you set me up ? did you set me up just to see me fail ?
wickwire was there to help . to be my eyes on the inside , to make sure you were getting a fair shot . at least that was the intent .
what changed ?
should probably ask him that .
so ? is not the president jumping on your bandwagon ?
what he did was light the bandwagon on fire . because he knows what i know that american families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm s way .
you do not know that .
in face , i do roper , harris , gallop they all come back the same .
what are you saying ? that a womengs life is more valuable than a mangs ? that a womengs death hurts a family more ?
you were never going to let women serve in combat . you always had a safety net . or thought you did .
jordan . i do not expect you to fully understand this but sometimes there s more to be gained from the fight than the victory .
so the rhetoric gets you headlines . but the reality gets you in trouble .
the reality is this we send far too many men off to war . i do not need to compound the problem with women . can you honestly tell me you wanted that life ? squat pissing in some third world jungle with
i once promised you a fast ticket , jordan , and i always meant to make good on that . come work for me . i can always use a hard charger on my team .
you promise wickwire a fast ticket , too ?
i have had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began . and that is quite verifiable .
i am sure it is .
you will think about my offer ?
you know , i wonder what the secnav would think about it . if i spoke with him .
so she picks the women , we pick the programs . seals ?
i would go special reconnaissance . every bit as tough and we have a percent drop out rate among the men .
then i suggest we start there .
what the hell is the president trying to do ? steal dehavengs thunder ?
i think it is more important , sir , to decide what we are going to do since it is apparent this issue is not going away quietly .
montgomery , why do they call you flea ?
it is really f . lee montgomery but that gets whittled down to just flea . for short , ma am .
so it really has nothing to do with actual brain size ?
no , ma am .
well , flea , i appreciate the respect you just showed me . but i do not need it and do not want it not that kind of respect , anyway . it is just gonna hurt us both , okay ?
i will work on it , ma am .
hey . you okay , flea ?
really do not wanna be captured , el tee . heard some bad things .
close as i can get , el tee !
six o clock ! marking , marking !
do not have to use it , o neil , but it is gotta go out . five . . . four . . . three . . .
i can make this wall without
just do it , okay ?
if you cannot feel the other guy s pecker , you ai not in tight enough ! i want nuts to butts !
come on , montgomery . . .
o neil ?
sir ?
time .
miller . thought the guy was made of depleted uranium . really did not expect to lose him .
boat five wickwire , cozad , vinyl , intagliata , ayers , and wise . lieutenant wickwire is your senior officer . follow his orders to your death .
you do not think she would be raped if she were captured ? you do not think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men ?
you broke a dozen training rules back there before i lost count .
i have had it . just because they pay me like a baby sitter does not mean i am gonna be one .
she is a trainee , just like the others . why are you coming down so hard ?
she is an officer . there s a higher standard .
she is a women , and that is why you are riding her bareback .
of course it is . and i am gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal rights thing , that real lives are gonna be lost . maybe mine , maybe yours .
i oughtta report you .
thank you , sir . but i like these just fine .
not doing them very fine , o neil .
i will try anyway , sir .
automatic five second deduction , which slips you under the wire . it is called gender norming , o neil standard procedure for all females in physical training courses . where you been the last few years ?
the navy cross . . .
i believe he earned it for saving a mangs life in saudi arabia . he wanted you to have it . he was very clear on that point .
i was looking for him earlier , but . . .
the chief was granted early retirement as of hundred yesterday . by hundred he was gone . out of the navy .
just a coincidence ?
lieutenant o neil .
gotta situation here . where are you ? stuck in traffic ?
do we know it is him using the beacon ? not a decoy ?
signals received only sparingly , in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries .
chances of recovery ?
north korean beaches are the best protected , most heavily monitored in the world . the civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an early warning system . extraction team has to be small and silent i would go with seals over delta force . problem is , do not want to hold a conventional sub off shore for target practice . where is the polk ?
halfway round the world . so that is the problem we can get the team in , just not out .
unless you whiskey run .
blank faces here , o neil .
you expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare back ? is that correct , o neil ?
that was good headwork , lieutenant .
thank you , sir . we hear back from the pentagon ?
probably hear back from cnn first .
hate this part . just sweating it out on the sidelines .
by the way , i will need that option paper by hundred today so i can review it with admiral hanover . and do we have any of that breakfast tea around here ?
so why are you even considering it ? are you ?
just like you would be .
spec recon . those guys are world class warriors . and they will not want you there , jordan .
well , you are doing shit hot at intel .
royce . we are the same age , we started the same time and now you are sitting in the upperdecks while i am still down in the bullpen . what does that tell you about the navy ?
she is haze grey and underway . . .
you need operational duty to really advance . . . you need combat training to go operational . . . yet combat training is off limits to people with tits . i am topped out at intel . forget the glass ceiling i am beating my head on a big brass ceiling .
so dump on me .
this has nothing to do with you .
well , guess i do not even need to be here . . .
get your dick back here . it has everything to do with you .
you are such a ball breaker sometimes . especially at night .
sorry . but after our days . . . so if i try this thing . . . if i ship out to coronado . . . what happens here ?
i will try to keep the door open . if you wash out , i make it so that
wai , wait . what happens if it works ? four months of training , three years of operational duty . what then ?
i do not feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life , jordan . maybe we should just let it happen .
which is guy speak for . . .
sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth . but i am trying to be honest , okay ? three years is a long time . do not ask me to predict how i will feel then , jordan , because i do not know . and either do you .
jordan . . .
i have been trying you for five days . do not they give you messages ?
it is hard to find time to sleep , royce . much less keep up with my phone life .
that bad ?
well , not this . i was doing the pentagon scene few nights ago . got some fresh stuff about you . you may be in a hostile camp . i think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn .
me ? why me ?
do not you know ? how they are talking about you ?
i saw an article . . .
so why are you telling me this ?
big symbols make big targets , jordan . i think someone s gunning for you .
you know , royce , i got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets , too .
i am only trying to warn you in case
well , let me warm you i am going though with this . the more everybody fucks with me , fucks with my head , the more it just makes me want to finish . so do not expect me back crying in your arms any time soon , okay ?
that is not what i want , jordan . i mean . . . it is and it is not . . .
still cannot make up your mind , huh ? gotta go , royce .
jordan . you watch your ass .
all i wanted was an honest chance . and if i could not get it , i could not stay .
and this class officer . . . wickwire . you think he was just trying to get even ? striking back for . . .
maybe . though it did not seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it . almost like . . . did i say he was class officer ?
almost like someone put him up to it . okay , who ?
no shortage of suspects .
c mon , jordan . do the headwork with me .
it is done with , royce . let it go .
someone screwed you over like this , left unanswered charges hanging over your head , and you are not gonna fight back ?
i am tired of fighting back . i just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world , okay ?
john james urgayle . the chief .
what about him .
instructors typically pull three year assignments . this guy s in and out in one year your year . that sound right ?
sounds like an amazing coincidence .
or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the navy .
i do not know , i do not care .
in washington . . .
what ?
wickwire , thomas dane . . . second run at coronado . . . and correct , they had him stashed in the appropriation liaison office , whatever that is .
you do not crap out of spec recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country . he is got a sea daddy somewhere .
i would sure like to know who .
so here we are again . staring three years of operational duty in the face .
look . it is not like you would be completely out of reach . and maybe we could call in a few favors , get you stationed at norfolk instead of coronado . there are ways of dealing with these things i mean , if people are so inclined .
which is guy speak for . . .
they are more afraid of you .
well , now i feel so much better .
it was made clear before you came harassment equals career suicide . cannot say anything good , so they do not say much at all . to your face , anyway .
whose orders were those ?
it was made clear . anyway , stay ballsy . first week s hell , then it levels out . until s . e . r . e . training , anyway . that is hell and a half .
and how do you know that ?
made it to week last time .
i did not know they let you try again . especially at your age .
hey . way to gut it out .
who is it ?
you know , i had an apartment about this size once .
wick . they got your crew , too ?
you really came back for more ? of this ?
when i was sitting behind a desk in washington , it made sense , somehow . blame it on my big brother . he was spec recon . and the stories he used to tell . . .
one time he was doing a rekkie of the libyan coastline . this is , like , right before we bombed khadaffi into the past tense . so his crew does a nighttime infil , maps all the big artillery placements and stuff , then turns around to get the hell gone . but between them and the water are five libyan guards , all armed to the nuts .
they had to kill em ?
nah , they were dead ass asleep . but on every guard s chest , they left one marlboro cigarette . just a little calling card to say they would been there and could come back any time they wanted .
that is a good story .
so the shit you gotta go through ? to get from here to there ? brother said it was worth it . worth the training . . . worth the divorce . . . worth anything .
he was married ?
at first .
you got anybody , wick ?
o neil ?
how would you make it last time , wick ? how would you get through this part ?
last time i did not .
sorry , did not mean to
that is okay . just an ex girlfriend . and know i remember why .
first big night of liberty and no date ? you are pathetic , wickwire .
maybe i will just head over to mcp s with the others , have a drink or four . do not wanna come , do you ?
i cannot go out . not like this .
i think you look beautiful .
do you , uh , know . . .
sure , sure .
we are going over to her place to make salad and pasta . just , you know , nothing special .
i am sorry , o neil . but as class officer , it is my obligation to report all violations .
what are you guys doing ? huh ?
just asking
she part of the training ?
if not , firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area . now how smart is that ?
feet , six inches !
cool ?
so we got two full mini tanks , three minutes each . cool ? how much air in yours ?
maybe half . not even .
say again , sir ?
chief , sir , i do not understand why
permission to get dressed , sir ?
it seems the men could not get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs . israeli men would linger over wounded females often to the detriment of the mission , often endangering their own lives . they do not use women anymore .
sir , someone mentioned you received the navy cross . may i ask what you got it for ?
for pulling a pound man out of a burning barrack in saudi arabia .
i see . so when a man tries to rescue another man , he is a hero . but when he tries to rescue a woman , he is gone soft .
females in combat situations impact unit cohesion . men fight better without women around . and that is an historical fact .
england went out with a stress fracture . that puts you in charge , lieutenant .
mccool s that same rank . we are both j . g . s .
simple question , lieutenant . no reason not to answer . what is your father s name ?
dad .
any brothers ? sisters ?
dick , jane , and spot .
are you hungry ? that is your favorite food ? we will try to get it for you .
green eggs and ham . you are not going to get anywhere . you might as well put me in the cage .
you are in the cage , o neil . right here , right now .
should i be afraid ?
why did not you shoot the woman , o neil ?
was not deemed a threat .
would you have shot if it was a man ?
no . yes . i mean , depends on
the others already told me , o neil . they wanted to shoot , but you would not let them . because you went soft on another women
that is not right .
that is what your crew said . are they lying ? or are you ?
i think you are the liar .
i am not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage . you wear the bars , you made the call , and you got your whole crew
we did not know we were compromised . firing would only have given away our position .
do you ?
no .
did not you know you would be raped if you were captured ? did not you even think about that ?
sure . just like your men do .
well , i am trying to figure out if you are stupid , unlucky , gluttonous or some new alloy of all three .
good to see you again , too , sir .
managed to activate the elb . if you just radio base and let them know , they will fix on that . oh , and make sure they send a helo with a winch door s blocked by a reef . over .
chief , sir rescue team will not be here for minutes . that is your air situation ? over .
say again ? how many micks ?
got it .
o neil . . .
well , who the shit you think you are ? coming in here like that ?
anybody using these drawers here ?
hey , hey , hey . no possibility . you cannot stay in here . you cannot sleep right next to me .
aw , lookit this , lookit this she is bringing tampax in here . c mon , you got nothing but rooms over there .
that your desk ? i will take this one .
would you just get outta here ?
clear .
all right , fire and evade maneuvers . drop everything but weapons and the prc radio we are gonna be high speed , low drag all the way to the link up site . ready ?
sure . now she wants to shoot .
i just wonder how that happened .
you do not suppose this is just part of . . .
maybe we should call the coast guard .
we are fucked .
darth vader reads poetry . . .
cannot live with them , cannot kill them . that is the point ?
you mind ? i am trying to eat here .
this ai not working right !
that is our go to shit plan , o neil ?
subject ?
o neil , jordan .
thought you two were file closed .
you knew about us ?
all right . so who stands to gain if jordan flames out in a big way ?
the e ringers ? full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time when congress is already swinging the axe .
congress cuts , military bleeds . but pentagongs a big place . let s narrow the sights .
the navy ? they have made it clear they do not want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for womengs heads . that is it gonna cost to make a fleet of trident s co ed ?
sabotage born of economics ? would not be a first . but is hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure ?
possibly . just to spite dehaven .
the white house . if jordan wins , dehaven wins in spades . why ? well , it is been said that the only man the president fears ai not no man .
the first female president ?
do not for a second think she did not leak this story . g . i . jane gives dehaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all .
women .
if you were the president , would not that put a little piss in your shoes ?
i do not know . seems . . .
this ai not about some little soldier girl slogging her way through commando school . the implications go way beyond .
christ , i do not want to see her take a fall . she thinks i do , but . . .
i take it this file is still open .
even tough i do not talk to her every day i still talk to her every day . know what i mean ?
okay , so now work it from the other end . think about california and how things might be handled there .
i do not . . . what , someone on base ? a mole ?
that is cuz i am married to you .
shut up . how can you eat like that ?
i am telling you he is dirt . he is a douche bag , gutter slime , dog crap , puke chunks . . .
hey , hey ! i am eating here !
audrey s going to stay with us tonight .
who the hell are all these people ?
what ? i just could not just let them sleep in the street .
where is audrey ?
in the bedroom . crying her eyes out because of you .
what ?
all that you gotta be vicious stuff you filled her head with .
me ! ? you where the one . . .
i like that image .
animal , you do not think that is true , do you ?
nice guys finish last . first rule of the jungle .
that why you dumped him ?
how long where you and dis guy going steady ?
great stuff , animal . were not you scared ?
he stole my report ! that is my report !
you okay ?
it is all my fault . what have i done , animal ? what have i become ? look at me . this is not me . i do not do things like this .
yeah , i just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me .
did not you tell me he left for the airport ?
yeah . why are you asking ?
my god . he is going after the nest .
animal , i cannot .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
do not you think we have enough ?
think we can fit up in there ?
he is not going to do it .
cut uptown , take th to th then cut up broadway .
you are crazy , go to the east side and take the park avenue to the jfk .
what are you talking about ? the east side is always faster .
audrey , did you take the tape out of the camera ?
i will take them all .
audrey ? ! is that you ? hi , hello . you look , wow , uh , how have you been ?
so you made it .
you are a reporter . that is what you always wanted to be , right ? i am happy for you . really , i am .
so , you still picking apart cockroaches ?
no , i am into earthworms now . you would not be interested . they are real boring creatures . very reliable , dependable , no surprises . . .
you are still mad at me , are not you ?
you just left me without a phone call , a letter , nothing . all this time . yeah , i guess i am still a little mad .
that was eight years ago . some people change , you know .
most people do not .
wait . i am sorry . you are right . eight years is a long time . can i offer you a cup of tea ?
i still cannot believe it . how does a guy go from an anti nuke activists to working for the nuclear regulatory commission ?
when you and i use to attend rallies in college , we helped to create awareness . but from the inside now i can actually effect change . i never lost my idealism .
and exactly what changes are you trying to effect ?
i have this theory that we are inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we have done to nature .
and you think this creature is one of them ?
yes . the first of its kind . i found this blood sample earlier this evening . . .
blood sample ? how close did you get to that thing ?
i got pretty close .
. . . he is pregnant .
well , obviously these tests were not designed for this but fundamentally they are looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy .
the ultimate expression of evolution , it reproduces asexually . think about it , all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction . that is why he came to new york . like every species of insufficient progenitors , he is nesting !
nesting ?
is this cause of me ? because of the story ?
well what the hell did you think was going to happen ?
you never said it was off the record .
i should not have to , audrey . you are supposed to be my friend . i trusted you .
i did not mean for it to turn out like this . look , i lied to you . i am not a reporter . when we broke up and i came out to new york i was so sure i would make it . but i have not . that is why i needed this story so bad . i just could not tell you i am a failure .
what are you doing here ?
i thought you said there would only be a dozen eggs .
circuits are overloaded .
come on , the broadcast booth is right over here .
how do you know ?
the network is on an intranet . it is a direct feed into our computer system .
if the military are listening , they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape .
are you okay ?
somehow i never thought your life was this exciting .
you would be surprised .
who was that french guy , anyway .
and i am supposed to remind you to call him on all of caimangs expense p . o . s .
my life sucks .
i cannot believe he put the moves on me . after everything i have done for him .
it is nick ! i know that guy . i know him !
who is he ?
did romeo have a name ?
four years . girl , i am surprised he did not ask you to marry him .
what the hell are you doing ?
remember my friend we saw on t . v . ?
your old sweetheart ?
yeah , well he just turned up in new jersey at the military command post . somehow all this is related to what happened down in panama . there s a story here . i know it . you got any tape or glue ?
wish me luck !
audrey , i do not think this is a very good idea . caiman finds out and he will have your job .
hey , do you have any glue in your bag ?
that is it to you ?
can i use some ?
what do i get ?
the warm feeling of helping your fellow man .
five bucks .
did you talk with humphries ?
this is not the place . . .
just tell me , did you talk with him ?
he said he would consider it . it is between you and rodriguez .
mr . caiman , you are married .
and you are beautiful . . .
mr . caiman . . .
call me charlie .
mr . caiman , i have been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year . and i have never asked for anything but this job is really important to me . i am too old to be an assistant anymore . i need to know this job is going someplace .
so have dinner with me tonight .
i cannot .
caiman , wait . take me with you .
what ?
i have got something on this . i know a guy on the inside with the military . . .
you do not understand , i can get us information . . .
we did it ! we have got the exclusive ! way to go , audrey !
we ? i do not think so .
i want that story , audrey . remember you work for me .
hi . nick tatopoulos . . .
three years digging up worms in chernobyl ? how did mrs . tatopoulos handle it ?
oh , i am not married .
really ? a girlfriend then ?
no . perhaps i work too much .
not for a long time , now .
well , i think you are cute .
hence the radiation .
evacuate manhattan ? that is over three million people . has that ever been done before ?
i am sorry about all this .
make sure they find that nest before it is too late .
merde !
they will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten .
we have secured the doors on both levels .
where is luc and pierre ?
they did not make it .
when we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone .
christ . how many tunnels lead off the island ?
only five , sir . we have checked them all . he has not used any of them .
have them sealed off .
and how should we do that , sir ?
who are they ? lieutenant , get those people away from there .
chargeures , property and casualty insurance . we are preparing a report .
you are fast .
that is our job .
well your people are getting in the way of my job .
major , what do you think could have done this ?
dr . niko topopolosis ?
it is tatopoulos .
right . the worm guy . can someone get those people off the beach ?
excuse me , would you mind telling me what the hell i am doing here ?
you did not answer my question . in fact , for the last hours no one has answered any of my questions .
look , i may work for the nuclear regulatory commission but accidents and spills are not my field .
do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the chernobyl earthworm ?
yeah , you are the worm guy .
the radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm s dna ! you have any idea what that means ?
no , but i have the feeling i am about to find out .
seventeen percent , huh ? sounds big .
they are enormous ! a new species created by mangs recklessness . that is what i have been trying to tell you , i am only a biologist . i take radioactive samples and study them .
what sample ?
that was a footprint . i was standing inside a footprint .
that is right .
but there s no animal in the world that can make prints like that ? is there ?
somebody must have seen it .
the radiation is not an anomaly , it is the clue . this creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur .
do not tell me why it is not , tell me what the hell it is .
you know , he is not an enemy trying to evade you . he is just an animal .
what are you suggesting ?
well , yes . i did . clearly he was injured and bled .
you see , all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that do not rely on heat seeking . . .
no , it reproduces asexually . that is why we must find the nest . if we do not , dozens will be born , each one capable of laying eggs of its own . very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population .
so after we kill the creature we will begin a search for the nest .
you gave them the tape ?
we think there s a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area .
general anderson , the problem was the terrain . if we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of central park . . . we should be able to take him down .
last time you did not even scratch it !
do you have any idea that is going on out there ? the phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city .
we are sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body .
organize a search party . i want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system .
are you looking for this ?
do i know you ?
we have met before .
sdece , service de documentation exterieure et de contre espionnage . agent phillip raymond .
sounds like a big company .
it is the french secret service .
oh .
we have learned that your american friends have decided not to look for the creature s nest .
are you sure ? how do you know ?
we know .
why are you telling this to me ?
i need you to trust me .
why do you need that ?
i need your trust if you are to help me find the nest .
oh , my bags . i have checked them in .
how did you get all of this stuff into the country ?
so why all the secrecy ? why are not you guys working with the us military ?
i am a patriot . i love my country . can you understand that ?
sure .
it is my job to protect my country . sometimes i must even protect it from itself . from mistakes we have made . mistakes that we do not want the world to know about .
your talking about the nuclear testing in the pacific .
here . rd street subway station . where we first found the fish . with a little luck , this will lead us right to it .
so you are in ?
that is with the chewing gum ?
they have turned off the ventilation system . they are calling him to dinner .
three eggs . i thought there would be more .
i think we should leave now .
contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape .
how do i do that ?
what would they say ?
who the hell are you ?
hello ?
it is raymond .
i understand .
i just wanted to say , au revoir and thank you for your help , my friend .
dr . lazarus . . . i hope that i am not breaching protocol but . . i am so very humbled to stand in your presence . . . i have studied your missions extensively . . . though i am thermian , i have lived my life by your philosophy , by the code of the mak tar .
well good , that is very . . . nice .
by grabthar s hammer , dr . lazarus , i
do not do that . i am not kidding .
i am sorry , sir , i was only
just do not .
this is it ?
yes sir . marvelous , is not it ? completely distractionless .
just as on your home planet , sir . if i may say , it took me three years to master the spikes , but now i sleep with a peace i never thought possible . . .
is that the bathroom ?
dr . lazarus , here is your surface mapper . i have programed it to the coordinates of a beryllium sphere of sufficient density .
thanks .
good luck on your mission , sir . by grabthar s hammer , by the suns of warvan i wish you
uh uh ! what did we talk about ?
sir , it is you thank ipthar !
quellek . what are you doing in there ?
i avoided capture using the mak tar stealth haze . where is everyone ?
sir ! the pressure . it is normalizing .
okay , quellek , let s get back to the command deck and suddenly we hear a pistol blast and quellek s chest turns red . alexander and quellek look down at the blood , horrified .
not so bad . we will get you to medical quarters . you are going to be fine .
i . . . i do not think i am going to make it sir . . .
no , do not talk like that , son . we are going to get you fixed up .
do not speak , quellek .
come on , old friend . . .
you will go out there .
i will not and nothing you say
the show must go on .
i am glad you asked . . . to me the most important qualities of a galaxy explorer are loyalty . . .
. . . to camera center no matter whose shot you are blocking . . .
god , what an ass .
calm down everybody . we are just here to negotiate general sarris surrender .
at ease men .
we have got to stop !
we stop we die . keep holding the thruster down tommy !
you do not hold a thruster down ! it is for quick boosts
no ! we are almost through !
do not be insane , stop ! full stop !
about this much .
that is the scale ? is that ten miles ? a hundred miles ?
there it is . the beryllium sphere .
go ahead !
you go first ! there s no time !
what ? what ?
nothing .
fred s no good , jason . you are going to have to kill it
alexander ? ? ? please ? you are my advisor , advise me !
. . . . well you have to figure out what it wants . . . that is its motivation ?
it is a damn rock monster ! ! ! it does not have motivation !
that is your problem . you were never serious about the caraft . . . i am a rock . . . i just want to be a rock . . . still . peaceful . . tranquil . . . . . oh , but that is this ? something s making noise . . . no , not noise , no . . . movement . vibrations . make the vibrations stop , they go straight into me like a knife ! . . . i must crush the thing that makes the vibrations . . .
hundreds dead , all so you could play at being the commander . you have murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch !
purple skinned monstrosity . . . ?
i was staying in character . egomaniacal sonofabitch ?
sense memory . i see you got to win the fight . . .
hex ! alex , are you okav ?
yes . good was done this . . . . .
jason , before we entered the black hole , my instruments detected strange energy surge from sarris shid similar to . . .
he is a twit !
not again . . .
settle down , alex . . .
what the hell is going on ? ! ! ?
he wants to think ! ?
could you possibly try not to hit every single one !
that is happened ?
you were holding it upside down were not you ?
shut up .
you know , with the makeup and everything i actually thought he was smart for a second .
you think you could do better laredo ?
and note the sucked in gut .
this is ludicrous . why are you listening to this man ? must i remind you that he is wearing a costume , not a uniform ? . . . he is no more equipped to lead us than this fellow . no offense .
you have a better plan , alex ?
he is a miserable twit !
oh alex , get away from that thing . . .
alex you cannot just leave .
oh good , there s nothing to eat .
why did not you stop at the market ?
i still have not got this bloody thing off .
you could order something in .
a boy comes to the door .
i do not know . . . it just was not like him .
oh my god , it is real .
we heard it the first time !
may i get the check ?
we have have to stop !
go into the cloud ! . . .
alex ? where are you going ?
look at that . . . will you look at that . . . they look like little children . . .
i do not know .
those blue things ate everybody here ?
he knocked me out the sonofabitch . where is he ?
you said the commander .
what ?
back there . you said the commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals .
no i did not .
he always has to make the big entrance .
he dissed us again , brandon !
hi brandon .
no time for pleasantries , kyle . we have a level five emergency . the commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads .
oh . okay .
you have got the utility systems walkthrough , right ?
i have sectors . i think hector has the upper levels .
commander , please settle a dispute that my crew and i are having . in the quasar dilemma , the sentient had taken control of the ship s guidance systems , however
commander , as i was saying . . . in the quasar dilemma , you used the auxiliary of deck b for gamma override . but online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix , so we were wondering where the error lies ?
it is a television show . okay ? that is all . it is just a bunch of fake sets , and wooden props , do you understand ?
yes but , we were wondering
. . . yes ?
we accidently traded vox units when we bumped into each other on saturday .
oh . . . oh , i see . oh .
that is your name , son ?
brandon .
brandon , i remember you from the convention , right ? . . . you had a lot of little technical observations about the ship , and i spoke sharply to you . . .
yes , i know , and i want you to know i thought about what you said . . . i know you meant it constructively but . . .
it is okay . listen
. . . but i want you to know that i am not a complete braincase , okay ? i understand completely that it is just a tv show . there is no ship , there is no beryllium sphere , no diagital conveyor . . . i mean , obviously it is all just a
it is real , brandon . all of it , it is real .
i knew it ! . . . i knew it ! . . .
okay , we got it .
okay , now left at the next turn . . . past the oxygen units . make a right there . then go through the antimatter vent . . .
okay . . . okay , now what .
commander , do you have a camera ? i would die to see this in person . . . all they showed on t , v was a machine here , and a wall here . . . i do not know why they did not show the whole thing .
we would never have the budget for this .
yes . . . ?
brandon . . just in case i die , there s something i have to know . . .
yes commander ?
what does the omega do ?
well , that is the big question , is not it ?
what do you mean ?
it is been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years . many believe that is a matter collapser , a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting seconds .
but you do not ?
no , i am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer , but a matter rearranger , converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past .
how did you come to that conclusion ?
brandon ! time to go !
commander , you and lt . madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals . tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom . . .
okay , now . but
no , wait , are you
lt . madison , go .
shit ! go !
go . they are off again .
up .
what ? up ?
i am at the control oaneh . what do i do ?
raise the glass and push the blue button .
that is it ?
structural damage at percent .
i just cannot believe it . any of it ! look at this room ! . . they designed it based on the tuaran pleasure ship from historical document thirty seven . oh and wait , wait , listen to this ! computer ?
yes ?
that is the weather like outside ?
there is no weather in space .
the ship is sustaining structural damage .
the enemy is matching velocity .
computer , what about our engines ? why do not we have power ?
the beryllium sphere has fractured under stress .
negative . the beryllium sphere will have to be replaced .
negative , no reserve beryllium sphere exists onboard .
systems register functional .
systems register functional .
u . . . . what do you think ?
that possibly . . . the valence bonds have shifted bi laterally ?
. . . what does that mean ?
what does that mean ? ! ! ! yes , i see ! yes . . . it means that perhaps . . . the . . . bonding molecules have become covalent ? ! . . .
covalent . . . right . so . . .
so our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate ! a two molecule compound sharing a free electron and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes !
hey commander . listen , we found some beryllium on a nearby planet . we might be able to get there if we re configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion . what do you think ?
a hologram . . .
never mind , fred . . . .
the digital conveyer ? you mean i am going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces ?
right .
no , i will kill you . .
fred , i worked summer stock with hopkins . regional theater with hoffman . but i swear to god i have never met an actor who could hit his mark , or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a freddy kwan . you are mr . dependable . . . you can do this .
as good as hopkins ?
how do you remember this stuff ?
you okay , alex ?
. . . the digital conveyor .
we have got to get that valve turned off . their oxygen is almost gone . . .
listen , i will go in , create a distraction . have this . . . may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape .
it is suicide .
i am just a glorified extra , fred . i am a dead man anyway . if i am going to die , i would rather go out a hero than a coward .
listen , i was wondering , would you guys mind if i sit in today ? see if anybody s interested in an autograph ? never know .
crewman . . . call me guy .
that is why you built this ship ?
the omega . . . why does that sound so familiar ? . . .
guy , you have a last name . we just do not know it .
where are the miners ?
oh , they are so cute .
i am so sick of being right .
how the hell is fred supposed to project a hologram ?
. . . okay
they are still behind us . . .
guy , you are not going to get killed on the planet , okay ?
oh , i am not ? i am not ? then that is my last name ?
your last name .
yeah , what is it ?
it is . . . i do not know .
we are screwed . . . we are so screwed . . .
that is it , that is that is going to kill me .
it does not have to be a hologram . . . just a diversion .
jason , are we doing episode or not ?
it is a rough plan , guy ! what does it matter if we are doing episode or not ? !
i know . . . you contruct a weapon . look around , can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe ? . . .
we re oetting hammered , jason . return fire ?
hi everybody .
hey . thanks for one nice intro . . . uh .
more to the left . . . stay parallel . . .
assault on voltareck iii . episode . . . i think .
we are doing episode ?
they are gone .
you have no idea what a perimeter is , do you ?
not a clue . you ?
we are alive !
e are alive !
a few fans built a little set in their garage . . i come in for an hour at most . it is a nothing .
how much of a nothing ? not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing ?
what ?
this is not mine . wait , where is that kid ? . . .
it is jason . . .
one minute i am hey , i am dressing .
let me try . computer ? computer ? . . .
only answers to me .
but i am the commander !
on the show i talk to the computer and repeat what it says . so that is what they built .
wait . when are you going to tell them ?
tell them ? about . . .
who we are . do not you think they are going to be pissed ?
are you kidding ? i am not going to tell them .
well you have to tell them . what if something happens ? we are actors , not astronauts . . . we cannot do this stuff !
it is not the stuff . i mean , anybody can learn the stuff . . . the important thing is commitmnt . of anything is just committing to it .
hey . . . hey where are you going ?
we have no right to do this . they deserve to know .
we are leaving , jason . we are leaving now .
there s nobody here . jason . . .
all right , now nobody panic , i have dealt with this guy before and believe me , he is as stupid as he is ugly .
jason . .
we are going to fire everything we have got at him , all right ?
jason . . .
i made the cut the line gesture . you nodded okay .
i thought it was the we are dead gesture ! i was agreeing ! like i know where the hold button is ? ? ?
maybe we can lose them in that cloud .
are they behind us ?
can it be repaired ?
do we have a replacement beryllium sphere onboard ?
self control ? that is funny coming from the guy that slept with every moon princess and terrakian slave girl on the show ! . . .
did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me ?
you are playing your good side .
all right . . . here s the plan first , fred , we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound , then gwen , alex , fred and i go down to get the sphere . any of those things come back , give a signal . guy , you set up a perimeter .
how does the rolling help , actually ?
clenched jaw . . .
jason . . can you hear me ?
thank god . are you okay ?
yeah . but i have got gorignak staring me in the face . i think i can take it though . . .
what ? what did he say ?
wait , the pig lizard is gone . why are they still chanting for the pig lizard ?
jason ? . . . i do not think the pig lizard was gorignak . . .
so . . . we get to shut down the neutron reactor ?
right .
uh . . . i hate to break it to you jason , but i do not know how to shut down a neutron reactor , and unless you took a learning annex course i do not know about , i am pretty sure you do not know how to shut down a neutron reactor either .
there s no hatch . there s no hatch !
what is that thing ? it serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of choppy crushy things in the middle of a catwalk ! ? .
gwen . . .
we should not have to do this ! it makes no logical sense ! why is it here ?
because it was on the show !
he is accelerating to mark .
never doubted you for a second .
where the hell is he ? an hour and a half late . an hour and a half !
you are kidding . when for ?
unbelievable .
you gotta admit , they do love him .
that is it , it is go time .
you should have let me hit him .
you know , that is really getting annoying .
i have one job on this lousy ship . it is stupid , but i am going to do it . got it ?
oh my god ! tommy ! stop the pod ! stop the pod !
we got the sphere but the commander s down there with a bunch of cannibals ! teb , reset the pod , we are going back .
that thing s not going to get us down there fast enough . face it , he is dead .
i heard it too .
jason you think you could get any closer to those mines ?
closer ? i can try .
tommy , look ! those lights . . .
first , i require the omega . . . second
yes . . . hi sarris . . . how are you doing ?
right . well . . . listen , i am i am sorry about that whole . . . thing . . before . it was kind of a misunderstanding . i am sure we can work this out like reasonable people . . . how is the uh . . . . . . that going to heal up ? god , i hope so , i feel just awful about that .
deliver the device now or i will destroy your ship .
listen , i would like to , but frankly . . i am not even sure where it is , or even . . .
you have ten seconds .
yes .
then tell me one thing . . . what does it do , the device ? the omega .
is it a bomb ? a booby trap ? tell me !
stop , please ! i do not know !
prepare a tear harness for the female . . .
no ! i swear i do not know ! please !
wait . what did you say ?
explain
my name is jason nesmith . i am an actor . we are all actors .
our dimwitted friends do not understand the concept of acting . they have no theater , no imagination these scientists .
we pretend . . .
simpler .
we . . we lie .
accelerate to mark , tommy .
commander , i must speak to you . it is a matter of supreme importance . . . we are thermians from the klatu nebula , and we require your help . i beseech you to come with us , back to our ship . a great many lives hang in the balance . . .
right , if this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent , but make sure i have a limo from my house , they jammed me into a toyota the last time i did one of these
i . . . certainly , but
sir , i understand this is a terrible breach of protocol , but please , i beg you to hear our plea . we are thermians from the klatu nebula . our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by roth h ar sarris of fatu krey . sarris wants the omega . we are to meet in negotiation . however our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous . the flames , the death . . . please captain , you are our last hope . we have secured a limousine .
commander . . . welcome to the protector ii . would you like to don your uniform ?
mind if we skip that ? i have to get back pretty quick for this thing in van nuys .
commander ? . . . where are you . . . going ?
home .
you . . . you mean earth ?
but commander . . . the negotiation . . . you . . . you . . . you fired on him .
right . long live . . . that is your planet ?
theramin .
long live theramini . take a left here ?
but what if sarris survives ?
oh , i do not think so . i gave him both barrels .
he has a very powerful ship . perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of
an interstellar vox .
how can we thank you , commander . you you have saved our people .
weapons storage . . .
it is perfectly safe . i promise .
to our brave guests . few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes . we are blessed to count ourselves among them .
mathesar ? . . . has sarris seen the . . historical records ?
no , thank god he has not .
then how did he find out about the device ?
our former commander was not . . . strong .
former commander ?
commander . . .
mathesar ? what is that ?
a thousand apologies . we have failed you .
you what ? . . what are you talking about ?
deception . . . lies .
well . . . sort of . . .
i am not a commander , there is no national space exploration administration . there is no snip .
but there it is ! . . .
a model , only as big as this .
but . . . inside , i have seen
sections of rooms made of plywood . our beryllium sphere was painted wire and plaster . the digital conveyor was christmas lights . . . decorations . it is all a fake . i am not him . . . i am a nothing . a nobody .
but . . . why ?
the ship is a model . . . as big as this ! . . . a very clever deception indeed ! he oa not oontaln his lauchter . a belle tommy set a course for home , lommander ?
you said we do appearances together , or not at all .
. . . to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies , and plenty of them
that is right . . . just keep shaking it out . . . here , have some gum , it helps .
wh . . . where are we ?
that is going on ?
excuse me ?
well , it is . . . this was a device we . . . discovered on an alien planet . we do not know what it does either .
where ?
faster tommy . get us out of here !
could be this .
do your best , tommy . . .
all right , gwen , alex , fred , follow me . guy , set up the perimeter . tommy , you keep a lookout , make a signal if they come back .
what kind of signal ?
anything .
okay , i will do this . . . caw caw !
oh , right , sorry .
sorry guys . . . it just went off .
okay . . . on what ?
how about the pig lizard ?
go for the eyes . like in episode with
it does not have eyes .
the throat , the mouth . . . its vulnerable spots .
no no no .
all right guys . . . uh . . . gwen and i are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually . fred , you and guy need to get that air valve back on . alex , see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case fred and guy cannot get the oxygen back in time .
jason ? what about me ? what do i do ?
pedal to the metal tommy . . .
let s do it , tommy .
commander ? . . . call me laredo ?
hold course , laredo !
continue forward , sir ?
lieutenant lathe , i confess i am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself . chasing across the universe to obtain what is , i am now certain , a bauble of fiction . tell me how best to obliterate this vessel ? i would like nothing to remain .
find them .
but sir , my men . the core implosion is not reversible . . .
enerao , i have host them . the maanetlsm o the field is disrupting our onstru ait . there they are
what ? wh
because they are coming right at us .
some say that hessians are invincible .
well , now there s something worth dying for . what do you think ?
hmmm . . . she is beneath me , i am afraid .
unfortunately , i will never get the chance . i am leaving in an hour for congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion . wasting my time , naturally . . . look at her teasing those bumpkins .
i am accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property .
we have got to attack the british ! now ! have they put you in charge yet ? do we have an army yet ? what is happening ?
i capture quebec leading an army by river fordings through maine . . . if we do not do it , the british will come down champlain , take back ticonderoga and attack us in the spring .
you would have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness .
over three hundred miles .
you seem pleased by the prospect .
that is your frank estimation of the british ?
well , you fought with them against the french and iroquois , how good were they then ?
they died well . otherwise , they did not do much right . but if we have war , the british will surely send their best troops right now they have no other enemies .
and a french alliance ?
ben franklings going to paris , but i think the french will be long on talk and short on guns . our troops are mobs , they will not take orders , have no equipment . . . could they beat the british ?
arnold !
damn it ! you have given us a whole new season , benedict ! and congress thinks that the british are going to ride right over us come spring . now half their army is back in canada .
congress has picked up it is skirts and is racing for baltimore . they are not waiting for spring ! of course , they still had time to deny my promotion . even john adams voted against it . . .
why in hell would john do that ? why in hell would any of them do that ? after all you have done , it is unbelievable !
oh , they have reasons . . . there s a lot of confusion these days .
they do not trust me , that is the truth is not it ? sam adams never did .
we are in bad shape , benedict , moral is low . before i can do anything , i need lee and his seven thousand troops . i have ordered him to join us three times . in my last letter i all but begged him to come here . the man is insubordinate .
go on . . . i want to hear everything .
congress is talking openly about replacing you with lee .
is that a fact .
what do you think , george , shall i resign ? it is what they want .
the army needs you .
the army can survive without me .
then , i need you . we all do . without your victory the men would have no hope at all .
someday , george , you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what congress thinks that is . it may come down to us , or them someday . you or them . cicero was right was is a time when the laws are silent .
i hope i never have to believe that .
after visiting congress i know what it is like being violated by come disproportionate asses ! ah , if she only knew that the most important men in the country possibly the world are sitting at this table . . .
we are so damned important ! look at us nathanael , you were a horse shoer , benedict , before this ?
well , george , who were you ?
our plan is to hit them as they leave .
while they are strung out ?
they are ready . believe me , the ones that stayed on here at valley forge are ready for anything . of course , we get nothing from congress . they need boots , coats . . . we desperately need food .
there was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at congress which says i am personally responsible for all our hardships . and . . . that i have encouraged the people of america to make me into a god ! benedict , it says that i have gone mad !
that cannot be .
there s this whispering campaign against me ever since gates won at saratoga .
gates ? he used my battle plan and i humbly submit that without me he would still be back at saratoga waiting for the british to attack . george , why have not you moved into the potts house back at the creek ? much more befitting of a commander and chief than your field tent . and . . . you could entertain . i think you need to entertain more . seriously ! get a few new jersey whores up here , invite some congressmen . . . could not hurt .
as soon as the men have good shelters i will move . perhaps martha will join me this winter .
have you heard ? the british are negotiating to make a trade for general lee .
i am sure his dogs will be overjoyed .
that scum joseph reed . . . they are calling him the king of pennsylvania . the mangs a budding cromwell . he condemns rich tories to death and then appropriates their property for himself . naturally , the pig hates me for every tory i have saved .
they love reed and his inquisition ! i think they hope to share in his disgusting profits ! it is becoming the american way !
these men were taken from their homes at night , tried by reed s courts which congress recognizes and , well , you can see .
colonel , sir , mrs . washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner ?
you , you just need a new flint , general .
you are never , never to touch my guns ! do you understand ! ?
yes , general . but if you have to shoot somebody , you cannot .
none of the servants is to touch a gun ! you know that !
misunderstood what ! ?
a lot of years have gone by .
what ? what are you talking about ?
me ? you apologizing to me ?
wil . . .
yes , general ?
you have served me loyally , year after year , without complaining . i have thought hard about you this past winter . i want to free you , wil . i want to give you your freedom , after this battle is fought .
yes , general .
wil , i am giving you your freedom . do you understand ?
no . i guess .
wil , i want to remind you of a conversation we started just before monmouth . . .
well , what have you thought ?
no uniforms . no coats , even ? in this weather ?
no , my lord .
what sort of boots would you say he is wearing ? i should say , no sort of boots at all . are not those rags wrapped around his feet ? is that what he marched here in ?
yes , my lord .
and , is that a pitchfork beside him ?
negroes ? washington has black men in his army ? are they good fighters ? that is that red ribbon on his arm , colonel ?
because they have hardly any uniforms , they designate officers with colored ribbons . my lord .
by red , what rank would you say this black , officer , soldier is , colonel ?
general lee , welcome back . i am happy you have decided to join us .
i am to take command of major general lafayette s division and lead the attack .
what the goddamned hell do you think you are doing ! ?
the british ! these men cannot stand against them !
who is that ! ?
that is greene . he is supporting our reconsolidation .
captain alexander hamilton , sir !
hamilton , you are going to have to cover our asses as we cross .
we have got powder but no ball !
how old are you , captain ?
i will be twenty next year , sir .
i will expect you for dinner this evening , captain hamilton . for christ s sake , have a bath .
excuse me , general , but may i ask how do you feel ?
no one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than i . but if victory is remote and there s any hope for a negotiated peace , we must keep this army intact .
i am so inclined .
general washington , is there actually going to be a compromise , i mean , a wouldeal with england ?
captain , i want you to know that i respect your openness . it would make me happy if you would join our table for dinner from now on .
with pleasure . . . and an honor . did you hear about nathan hale ?
that young school teacher . . . i heard the british hung him as a spy .
they are among the best divisions the british have . no conscripts , no impressed recruits , just professional killers .
i was a clerk s apprentice on saint croix . but , then i went to king s college .
are you going to keep him , sir ?
it is impossible to stop these men deserting in winter , you might as well stop geese from migrating .
what are we going to do ?
general greene is here . there are two other divisions here .
yessir .
sir , i think no such thing .
do not lie to me , hamilton ! if i had not court martialed arnold . . .
sir , arnold is a traitor .
i must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect !
what is this ?
this is a declaration of insurrection ! who wrote this ! ?
george , remember that night when we were drinking with arnold ?
to hell with arnold . . .
he warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people even if it was against congress . george , the time has come for you to declare yourself king of america . listen to me , the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne ! george , you must declare yourself with us or against us .
that is your advice , alexander ?
i want to address the officers , all the officers . next friday . can we arrange it at the mess ?
yes , i believe so .
have you decided if you are going to join the virginia delegation to the constitutional convention ?
i am not sure .
george , you are the only man the people trust . . . trust with power . they know you will not betray them .
that is why the people trust you george . without someone at the convention , who has the people behind him , everything will fail . will you do it ?
horatio ! horatio gates , of course you know john adams of the massachusetts delegation .
good day , mister adams . . . george , that is the word from boston ?
the last i heard , a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on breed s hill . with one stroke the british could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it .
who s in command out there ?
who the hell knows ? everyone s giving orders . it is all very democratic .
well , john adams , your cousin has a marvelous gift .
with your support , horatio . as one of our own who has seen combat with the british , your opinion counts .
you will not be needing his largess , rhode island is already committed to your appointment .
colonel charles lee . . . hounds and all . quite the character . he is got a tremendous reputation .
if he supports the british why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them ? unlike general lee . . . who you and congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent !
lafayette is a child !
george , i am sorry . we all know the army will acquit arnold . . .
of course the army will acquit him , that is not the point . . . arnold is a man and will understand . what i need to understand is , john , sam . . . what is happening here ? who are those people in there ? the fat ones in silk ?
they are . . . friends of congress .
washington is perfect . he is a southerner , he is a war hero and he is rich !
he is from virginia there is no more classist , elitist . . . english place on earth than virginia . and , what in hell has he done for our cause ? washington has been preaching compromise , compromise , compromise ! hancock acts , he led the boston tea party ! that is why new england loves him .
let s not over do it . . .
i tell you every damned place i go the man is adored ! general washington ! champion of trenton ! savior of the republic ! and you should hear the way people are deprecating congress !
makes you gag .
gag on your own invention , then .
oh , come now . . .
you think that ?
no one wants another failure right now , god knows . but people like arnold and , god knows , i am having my fears about general washington .
finally ! ? it is people like these who , as soon as they get a little power , want more and more . more ale , here !
partially . . .
i doubt arnold will be afraid .
did god ever make such a pitiful army ?
no officer is going to get these men to fight ! they had the life crushed out of them on long island . at the most , perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost , then retire to protect congress .
i hear general lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in new york why will not he come on ! ?
general lee is detained captain . . .
detained by what ?
the british army , sir !
congress is bitterly opposed to allowing negroes in the army !
we already have black soldiers in our army . . .
unofficially , general greene .
any word from canada ?
spies from quebec confirm that the british are sending an entire fleet down lake champlain . . .
my god . . . they mean to finish us . what about arnold ? he is up there .
if we have any hope for a compromise or truce with england now , we have to hold on here our men must believe they can win the british must believe that somehow , in some mad , impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them .
colonel reed . . .
that damned arnold is here , is not he ? did you know he lost all his ships ? outrageous and completely unacceptable .
joseph , the british spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges . in my opinion he saved my army .
a grand scheme ?
a ground swell christian movement , george , you see ?
no . as a matter of fact i have not the slightest idea what you are talking about .
what do you mean you are not a christian ? of course you are a christian , we are all christians . . .
i mean , i am a deist . a belief i share with the likes of tom jefferson and ben franklin . surely you knew that .
but the hessians are there ! no one can beat them ! that is why cornwallis stationed them there ! they have the post of honor ! they are invincible !
they are also very religious . so , we will attack them three days from now , on christmas . one force under me , and another to the south under colonel cadwalader . . .
george , i am afraid if you go through with this madness i must tender my resignation as your aide . i see where we are headed , you are putting your trust in the likes of hamilton and arnold . . .
how many generals do we have like arnold ? he is got guts he is vain , and he fights !
and , hamilton ? greene ?
they help me understand why we fight .
understand ? you need to be listening to people like john adams , and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind !
gentlemen , let me get to the point , i cannot see the wisdom of pursuing this old court martial against general arnold .
the man is a traitor !
arnold is indispensable , do you understand ? i need arnold to help me win this war !
well , i shall deny him to you ! he is evil on earth !
however , through my relations with members of his majesty s court , i am a representative of the french government whose deepest desire is to be one people , united with our american brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of king george of england . vive la france ! vive l amerique !
we have more officers created by congress than we know what to do with .
sir , please accept my commission from congress . . . and . . . you must see this portrait of my beautiful wife , adrienne , we had the most perfect little baby girl just before i left . her name is henriette . . .
gentlemen , my i introduce a french gentleman , recently appointed major general by congress . . . marie joseph paul yves roch gilbert du motier , marquis de lafayette . general lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen , and . . . how many cases of muskets , mon petite marquis ?
continentals , congress paper money . it was worthless to start with , but as you see , counter feiters have made them even less than worthless . can you tell which one is fake ?
i . . . they look both the same .
no , please an advance on your salary .
mon general , i have come here to learn and to give , not to take . i am serving without salary .
you must be very rich .
i am . then , i understand you too serve without salary . you know , since your charming little victories at trenton and princeton , the french court is softening . i expect any time now a ship load of supplies . . .
charming little victories ? please do not expect much more of us , monsieur .
i only meant . . .
these supplies . . . ?
muskets and uniforms and bayonets .
and how rusty are these muskets ?
well , we will accept these charming little gifts . when we see them . meanwhile , please , take your pick of a horse .
i rode here , on my horse .
because , if the british got off their asses and came up here , now , we would be smashed . and the revolution would be finished . tell king louis , it is that bad .
like flowers after the snow melts .
what is it , marquis ?
my god ! who ordered this retreat ? !
general lee , sir !
i feel the same , sir .
it is another demonstration against the king . this is the wildest yet .
my god , these people mean to go to war ! they really mean it .
surely you knew this was coming .
our beloved father , the king , also refuses to bend .
but to go to war over trade , over money ? surely there s still time for a compromise .
of course , if it were that simple . these people ? they are after something else . . .
my god , what ?
well , a very real expectation is the british will hang you ! they will burn mount vernon and they will hang you ! our marriage is a business just as surely as . . .
i am very aware of that .
i can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated , to be destroyed . . .
do not be ridiculous , of course that will not happen .
the day tom jefferson frees a slave i will ride naked through the streets of williamsburg on a mule . tom jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small . the only man out there who really does what he says is sam adams and everyone thinks he is crazy . believe me , this wouldisturbance is not going to last long . you have to understand , congress is a chicken coop full of foxes , martha , each and every one has his eye on a nice , fat prize .
and , what prize do you see ? what could we possible gain ?
but , as usual , it will not go well for . . . them . martha , you must trust me .
liberty , virtue , country . . . that is from cato . . . you know , that play about the noble romans ? as i was riding up to philadelphia , i found myself thinking about the old days . . .
when you lived with the fairfaxes ?
when i was a young man we used to recite cato . . . we would come together recite it like they were words from heaven . devotion to country , duty , purity of heart . . . purity of heart . i was drunk on something then . . .
that is right . . .
did you know that jefferson has proposed a law in virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church ?
i think i heard that .
it is an anti christian dogma ! i cannot believe you are so calm about it !
what else ? from virginia ?
martha . . . what ?
virginia is outraged with your order allowing negroes to fight in the army . there s a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal . they wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests .
to win this war i need an army .
oh , indeed ? you know very well people are frightened of arming the negroes ! they beg you to consider the future . what good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish ! ?
that is the point of a revolution if it does not ?
some things must never change .
is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men ? it is damned condescending !
do not condescend to me ! we have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind . . .
well , we must keep in mind the dower laws . one third of everything we have is mine and since our negroes have been interbreeding , it would be legally impossible to distinguish them .
martha ! for god s sake !
leave me , now sir , i am tired .
not today .
i want you to see our hospital .
we cannot take them . are you all right ?
we are leaving them ?
they are finished , they cannot help us anymore ! they have done their duty , general greene , now you do yours !
colonel washington ? colonel nathanael greene , rhode island militia .
yes , yes , happy to meet you .
i . . . i am possessed of the idea of a command in your army , sir .
it is not my army yet , colonel greene . looks like you have seen some action did you hurt your leg , in a fight ?
but , you do come from a military family ?
a horseshoer ?
the only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them ! fifty lashes each !
sir , congress has not issued their pay for two months , many have not eaten properly for at least that long . you are being a little hard on them , do not you think ?
nathanael , someone bred to station , bred to being a gentleman unlike these men his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs .
i certainly did not mean you . of course you are a gentleman , an officer and a gentleman .
general greene ?
i am with captain hamilton .
they are just disgusting , jealous , bottom feeding swine . it is their nature .
sir , if you do not mind my saying , i do not understand your history at all . i mean , why would you want to win the war ? you are not after glory , like benedict . . . you are a slave owner , and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army .
you do not believe i can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism ?
no . we are all of us after something . it is easy for me to fight for the common man . my father could only dream that i would be . . . a general someday ? and what of my daughter or son ? i know what i am after . but now , with all this talk about compromise ? it means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope .
i will not betray you , nathanael .
at one time i could have chosen not to be .
what the hell are we doing ?
nathanael , i am sending you to virginia to head the southern army , to harass cornwallis . marquis , you must go with him .
sir , i have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform . . .
they are for my bodyguard . i have an absolute conviction that arnold is planning to have me assassinated ! it will be harder if i am surrounded by a body of men who look like me , do not you think ?
well , this must be about something !
if the constitution is ratified . . . we will have a country . they will want to elect you president of the convention , which means president of the country .
well , the widow curtis will bring you riches , position , land , even half grown children . you will not have to do anything at all ! you sha not have to do another thing to prove yourself .
you know very well who it is that i love .
george , you know i only love you , but . . .
but not more than your comfort .
and what is this , then ? been off to fight the french because you are a patriot ? or is this you , gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war ! ?
that is a lie !
is it ? william says now you have requested a british commission , why not colonial ? i will clear it up for you , sir , because as a british officer you can lord over colonial yokels more than that , it will even get you into polite society ! your dream come true , george , the only dream that really matters to you .
perhaps you have been counting my acres , mrs . fairfax , and discovered exactly how poor i really am .
now that is a lie ! see how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet ! when you break off your engagement to martha curtis , i will divorce william ! do you hear ? you get what you want from this world , then throw it all away on love !
you remember , george , when we were studying the great philosophers ?
i remember a pair of young philosophers once , who laughed at the world .
well , i remember a philosopher who said something that i used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements . . . but which i now see means us all .
really ? which precious homily was it ?
so , you are william s wild young neighbor ? or should i say , brother william claims you as a member of his family . i have heard so many unflattering tales about you , and i understand , that except for you , this family is quite cultivated .
george , i am sorry .
oh , but you must not mind my talking about you ! in fact , william says my main job here at belvoir is to civilize you to make an honest english gentleman out of you .
we can grow three primary crops in a season and , if we have some luck , we get a forth . the temperature is generally mild .
except for that , quite like home england , that is .
think what the play means , william . perhaps these words have a place in the real world .
where . . . do those men come from , george ?
africa , of course .
africa ? that is so far ? how do they get here ?
slavers capture them and bring them here .
capture them ? well , i have never seen anything like it , so . . . of course i am curious .
the word minuet finds its source in minitus , which is latin meaning small or orderly .
or , civilized .
cranes ? who needs to walk like a crane ?
what do you really think of the minuet , anyway ?
then why are you teaching me . . . ?
i always though london was the place to be capital of the world , the most spectacular city on earth .
the place to want to be is america . every english child dreams of it . i dreamt it .
do you ? when i saw those men yesterday in the field . . . and the women and children in those hovels ? i am not so sure if america is as far from england as i would hoped .
it is the freest land on earth .
is it ? well , i am scared of what we have become in our freedom .
and to think i am teaching you to become one of them . . .
i do not laugh at you , george . i like you . i like you because you will never , ever make it as an aristocrat . . . and that is because you are completely incompetent at hiding your feelings .
what are you doing ?
let s get you darker !
you are out of your mind !
why ? juba was an african and you want to look the part hold still .
they can use their imaginations .
i have been surprised in an unguarded hour , but must not now go back the love that lay , half smothered in my breast , has broke through all , its weak restraints , and burns in its full lustre . i cannot , if i would , conceal it from thee .
i am lost in ecstasy ! and dost thou love , thou charming maid ?
remember , george , it is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong .
that is good . . . who ?
you are a slave owner ! you have been illegally surveying lands beyond the ohio valley ! that land belongs to the natives !
all people have rights !
just because they are born ?
yes !
who says so ?
i say !
i see . . .
and others , say . . . have you even read locke , vattel , voltaire , diderot . . .
you hear that ?
that ? i hear a mob unemployed , drunkards , vagabonds . . . the world s dregs .
is that your test of patriotism , george if a man will die for you ?
the land here is best for grain and corn .
my daughter , i ask only . . .
for god sake , get that horrid stuff off your face . you look like a damned slave ! it is damned humiliating .
juba was a numidian .
william , we have been studying hard , i really know my stuff .
what is this ?
an oldsmobile silhouette .
i reserved a cadillac .
yeah , well , this one s the cadillac of minivans .
you are kidding me , right ?
shit , now someone s gotta climb down there and get him .
you did not have to shoot him , bo . we coulda just beat him up some .
cat , that is the lamest idea i have ever heard .
and i mean high up in it . that is why harry s gonna make mr . lovejoy with me , not chili palmer .
mr . lovejoy ? that is cute , bo .
does not matter what it is called , harry s got martin weir and it is gonna be big .
he knew it was a set up . he was ready for it .
so where is the money ?
i guess still in the locker .
you guess ? you mean you do not know ?
you see the paper ?
i seen it , but i do not believe it . says harry shot ronnie five times . four to the chest and one through his foot .
his foot . jeez , poor ronnie . . .
listen , tonight , later on , i got one for you does not involve any heavy work . i want you to go have a look around chili palmer s hotel room .
i cannot . i got to take farrah to satangs place down in costa mesa .
who ?
her mother . not that it matters because i do not work for you no more . i quit . i just wanted to come by , tell you to your face so there s no misunderstanding .
whoa . . . this is the man used to jump offa high buildings ?
into air bags . there s no cushion under what you are doing . i am out of it , cat . i am done .
bear . the colombians are in l . a . seems they all upset about their money . that ai not enough , as a bonus , it turns out the yoyo was escobar s nephew .
he is gonna plea deal his way out . give up this ace stunt man now one of the west coast dope kings , if they go easy on the cat .
i heard in the federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your daddy on father s day .
after this one , i am out , cat , you understand ? this is the last time we talk to each other .
remember harry s story about the dry cleaner palmer was after ? guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline ?
what about him ?
i was thinking tonight you could go have a look around palmer s hotel room while i go check out karen flores place . see if he has not stashed it somewhere .
and if we do not happen to find it under palmer s mattress or inside karen flores undie drawer ? what then ?
you get the money ?
no . that is this ?
trade for what ?
you get life for kidnapping .
calm down , bear . . .
hell , why not just shoot her ? why not shoot everybody . fucking shoot me . shoot the fucking president ?
and that is for the airport .
hey , he should have a weapon , a knife or something .
you keep hitting him like that , he ai not gonna look like he broke in anymore , he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him .
i do not know how i could have missed you with that shirt on . it is the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color . right ?
so you did not have the key with you .
you think i would be standing here ? you set somebody up and you want it to work , it has to be a surprise . can you remember that ?
what , did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in ?
i have to ask you for that key .
what , the setup did not work so you want the key back ?
catlett says if you do not open the locker the deal s off .
look , there s no fucking way i am gonna give you the key , outside of you point a gun at my head . then we might have something to talk about . now step away from the car .
what are you hanging around with a guy like that for ? you were in the movies , right ? a stuntman ? that is he ever done he can talk about ? you feel okay ?
not too bad .
i think i pulled my quadriceps .
so . . . how many movies you been in ?
about sixty .
where is my nephew ?
your who ?
he is my sister s kid . no papa . not too bright . personally , i think he is a retard . i only gave him the job as a favor for my sister , you understand ?
sure . family . i know how that goes .
he comes up here with our product . he suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars . he never shows up . meanwhile , my sister s going crazy calling me all the time worried about him . me , i just wanna know what happened to my focking money .
well , i do not know . i gave the man his money , sent him on his way .
you gave him the money ?
i gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it .
now why would you do that ? put the money in a locker ?
because there were a zillion dea guys hanging around the terminal .
maybe your nephew panicked , took off .
where is your partner , the jumpy one ? why is not he here ?
he is around someplace .
you know , you speak very good english , mr . escobar .
that is this movie you are doing first ?
but first i want to know who i am talking to . am i talking to you , or am i talking to him ?
you can talk to me .
you understand i knew harry was lying , saying this was not any good , but holding on to it , man , like you have to break his fingers to get it from him .
i am just explaining to you what i am doing here . case you think i come to rob the place , rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has .
harry called you his associate , but what does that mean ? i never heard your name or read it in variety or the reporter or anyplace .
it is what he said , i am his associate .
you must bring something heavy to the deal .
says here you are getting martin weir for the part of lovejoy .
yeah , we are getting martin .
no shit , come on . how you gonna do that ?
i put a gun right here . . . . . . and i tell him , sign the paper marty or your fucking dead . like that .
i wonder , would that work ? you know who i see for al roxy ? harvey keitel . the man could do it in his sleep .
harvey keitel . yeah . maybe . he was pretty good in the movie fingers .
i missed that one . or , hey , you know who else ? morgan freeman . you know morgan ?
yeah , morgan freeman . but he is a colored guy .
title s the first thing s got to go . and the guy s name . i mean , even this writer s name , murray saffrin is better than lovejoy .
there s ilona .
what about her ?
get something going there .
with ilona ? you know how old ilona is ?
she is . . . young .
young ? she is fucking nine years old , same age as lovejoy s kid . bernie . one she calls bernard . have you read the script ?
yeah , i read it . i was just thinking you could make her older . we might even be able to get karen flores .
who ?
you know how to write one of these ?
there s nothing to know . you have an idea , you write down what you wanna say . then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong , if you are not positive yourself . maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words . . . although i have seen scripts where i know words were not spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all . so i do not think it is too important . anyway , you come to the last page you write in fade out and that is the end , you are done .
that is all there is to it , huh ?
i really think i can be of service on this one .
i need the money .
what money ?
the three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named leo .
i cannot believe the way you guys do business out here . i cannot believe how fucked up your organization is .
how about i give you to three , then i organize your fucking brains all over the wall back there . one . . .
what , you gonna shoot me now , bo ?
in just a second . two . . .
i do not believe this .
karen ? you okay ?
that is a nice scream , lady . you oughta be in movies .
alright , bo . you can have the money . . . but it is not here . i have to go get it .
you know laurel canyon ?
i will find it .
i am at wonderland avenue . it is right off laurel .
where is karen ?
she is great . gimme the money .
you broke in my house and i have a witness to it .
only this time , no john wayne and dean martin shooting the bad guys in el dorado .
it was rio bravo . robert mitchum was the drunk in el dorado , dean martin in rio bravo , practically the same part . john wayne , he also did the same thing in both . he played john wayne .
man , i cannot wait for you to be dead .
harry , you think we go to see your movies ? i have seen better film on teeth . makes no difference to me which one our money s in . so how about you take our twenty points out of freaks and put em in this other one , mr . loverboy .
i cannot do it .
you positive about that ?
bo . i am great . listen , i am expecting some people
you must be making some big deals , doing lunch in a place like this ?
i am working on a few things .
yeah , i hear you bagged martin weir for mr . lovejoy .
last night . when he called me over to your office to talk about it .
chili palmer showed you my script ?
listen , harry , how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand ? you pay me back at your convenience , no interest .
you serious ?
how about another one for mr . zimm . a double .
you are gonna just give me five hundred grand ?
he was watching letterman , huh ? sneaky , that chili palmer . so , he ever find this dry cleaner , the one with all that money on him ?
assuming i go along with this , when can i have the five hundred ?
whenever you want it . the money s in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags , you know ? in a locker at the airport , waiting to be picked up .
the airport .
i do not know .
c .
i can hear you , but where the fuck are you , man ?
what i been wondering is where is he been .
okay . then be good enough to hand us our money back , or you think about us coming in on this new one .
you get to town , you go straight to the bank , raid the limo account .
i am already in town , but it do not matter . we got dick in the bank . we dumped it all in harry s movie .
ray barboni ?
who is this ?
are you the guy they called ray bones ?
depends . who s this ?
who is this ? i am the one telling you the way it is , okay , asshole ? that is who i am . now you want your three hundred grand or do not you ?
what three hundred grand ?
hello ? you there ?
yeah , i am here . i just do not like the anonymous crap . it means your either chickenshit or not for real .
yeah ? well , trust me . i am very for real .
okay . so who are you ?
i work for harry zimm , alright ?
who ?
harry zimm . the man happens to be a major hollywood player .
never heard of him .
so , what , this zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee , that what we are talking about here ?
hey , zimm does not ask for dick . zimm tells you the way it is . . . or else .
or else what ?
where is leo devoe ? where is chili palmer ? where is my fucking money ?
what ?
look at me , ray .
you say look at you ?
how would you get in here ?
i told them i was you . i acted stupid and they believed me .
so what brings you to l . a . , bones ?
why would i do that ?
i checked the bag at the airport , when i came .
yeah ? which terminal ?
sovereign .
you found leo , did not you ? took the poor asshole s money and put it in a locker , ready to go . why have not you left ?
look , there s no reason you and i should not get along . forget all the bullshit from before i do not even remember how it started . you took a swing at me over some fucking thing , whatever it was forget it . you owe me some money , right ? forget that too . but , you do not say a fucking word about this to anybody . it is strictly between you and me , right ?
who the fuck are you ?
ray barboni . from miami .
the man you are stepping on belongs to me and my partner .
he owes me money .
get in line , bro .
i do not like waiting .
tough shit , bro . this ai not miami . you want something , talk to me .
you a quick draw . . . bro ? you better be , your piece stuck way down in your belt like that .
you live in miami ?
that is right .
what are you doing in los angeles ?
i am in the movie business .
you are an investor , is that it ?
i am a producer .
you have a card in here ?
your wife a lakers fan ?
by the way , you recall the number of the locker you used ?
it was c . . . i do not know , sixteen or seventeen , one of those . why ? you looking for anyway , a bomb or something ?
something should not be there .
why do not you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look . maybe you will find it .
that is the idea . i will think about it .
that is what i would do . make sure i got the right guy next time .
anyway , you want this guy , he is in l . a . we put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the keno room .
leo spanked a waitress ?
hey , chil ? since you are going out to l . a . anyway .
what have you got ?
guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand , sixty days over a movie producer .
jesus , if i have a heart attack , i hope you know what to do .
have we met ? i do not recall .
did you stop to think what if i had a heart attack ?
i am looking at you .
i want you to keep looking right here , okay ?
that is what i am doing .
you know dick allen , mesa s casino ?
dick allengs a very dear friend of mine . how far you want to go with this ?
operator , how do i get las vegas information ?
a marker s like a check , harry .
i know what a marker is .
you are not looking at me , harry .
why do i have to keep looking at you ?
i want you to .
you gonna get rough now , threaten me ? i make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken ?
come on , harry mesas ? the worst they might do is get a judgment against you , uttering a bad check . i cannot imagine you want that to happen , man in your position .
you make movies , huh ?
karen , say hello to chili palmer . chili , this is karen flores .
you want to hear this idea ? it is about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand . go on , tell her .
you just did .
it is the kind of situation , you do not pay , you get your legs broken .
without him . the guy s so out of it he does not even know it is gone .
keep going .
so he comes to l . a . . .
that is it ? that is your movie ?
i said i had an idea , that is all .
that is half a movie , with holes in it . maybe forty minutes of screen time . you do not even have a girl , a female lead , and on top of that , there s no one to sympathize with , you do not have a good guy .
the shylock s the good guy .
part of it , yeah .
wait a minute , you are not the guy , are you ? the dry cleaner ?
you mean , leo ?
you would not be talking to me if you were .
i am not the guy , harry .
but you work for the casino ?
i am out here looking for leo . i just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend , dick allen .
is that right , that is what you do for a living ?
i imagine in your line of work , there were times you had to get rough , you know , say one of your customers stopped paying .
you pack a gun ?
not really .
what does that mean ?
maybe a few times i have .
ever shot anybody .
once .
really ? you ever been arrested ?
i have been picked up a couple times . loan sharking . racketeering . but i was never convicted . i am clean .
these guys , my investors , they run a limo service , came to me originally , put money in a few of my pictures and did okay , they are happy . so they come in on another deal this was back a few months ago when i was planning what would be my next picture , about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake . the characters , there s this seven hundred pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys , gets them in her trailer
you are trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid , and that is hard to do . let s just get to where you are at , okay ? you blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in vegas on a basketball game and you have not told em about it . why not ?
because they are not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint . the first thing they would do is break my legs .
you got that on the brain , harry . if you are so scared of em why would you take their money to vegas to begin with ?
because i need half a million to buy a script .
for a movie ?
a blockbuster . but quality . no mutants or maniacs . this one s gonna be my driving miss daisy .
that is it called ?
mr . lovejoy .
mr . lovejoy ? that is the title ?
murray saffrin , guy who wrote it , did all my grotesque pictures , had it in a drawer for twenty years . he shows it to me one day , tells me he is got a star interested , would i produce it .
two time academy award nominee , martin weir .
martin weir . he played the mob guy that turned snitch in the cyclone .
one of his best parts .
no , his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed mt . whitney .
she looks familiar .
anyway , murray has this shrink , who also happens to be martings personal trainer s shrink . murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to martings trainer who reads it to martin while they work out , and martin flips . loves it .
so that is the problem ?
the problem is murray . he and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the kern a few weeks ago . murray never made it back .
he drown ?
doris , murray s widow , finds out about this martin weir thing and says since murray and i never had any written contract , she wants five hundred grand for the script .
so you are thinking what if i was to put you next to my dry cleaner . ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie .
that , or i am thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow saffrin
i am not gonna pop her , harry .
just a thought .
but i could talk to the limo guys . tell em to leave you alone for a while . make the point in a way they would understand it .
you do not even know these guys .
harry , i probably know em better than you do .
what do you get out of this ?
lovejoy sits behind the wheel , watching the bar across the street , getting his video camera ready for action . . . that is he doing ? following a guy ?
no leave em up , we want the light in their eyes . i will be at the desk . . . but do not introduce me , let it go , just start talking . you are gonna be here , behind em when they sit down .
they will be looking at you . they do not know who you are .
you do not say any more n you have to . you say , well , i am glad you assholes stopped by , so i can set you straight .
what ?
i do not know , maybe i was not clear . but i thought . . . i told you to keep your mouth shut .
i had to tell em something .
you tell me you want these guys off your back . next thing i know , you are saying yeah , maybe they can have a piece of mr . lovejoy . i could not believe my fucking ears .
i said i would think about it . what does that mean ? in this town , nothing .
that is the difference between you and me , harry . i say what i mean . i want something from someone , i ask em straight out . i want martin weir , i go get martin weir . i do not fuck around with his trainer s shrink .
how is anyone gonna see anything from way up there ?
hey , harry .
here s your keys , harry .
is he giving you a check or cash ?
okay , harry , i am wrong . you are not the one he is setting up .
really .
yeah , he wants us to talk to buddy , set up a meeting .
so how about it , mr . selznick , do i make my deal with bo ? or you gonna finally help me out , have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him .
forget about leo s money , harry .
you have it ?
harry , if i gave you leo s money you would have ray bones all over your ass and then you would be in a whole new kinda trouble .
who ?
ray barboni . guy from miami , owns leo now that momo died .
who the fuck is momo ? jesus , these fucking names . . .
maybe i oughta talk to this ray bones character myself . see if he wants to invest in my movie .
you cut straight hair in this place , or just fags ?
you got a miss . leo devoe . guy s six weeks over .
he died .
yeah , he told me .
personally ?
yeah , ray , he personally told me he got killed in that get away airlines jet went down last month .
what get away jet ?
it was in the herald .
yeah , well , maybe the guy took out flight insurance . check with the wife .
which also means when i speak , i am speaking for jimmy . so e . g . as of now , you start affording me the proper respect .
e . g . means for example , ray . i think what you wanna say is i . e .
bullshit . e . g . is short for ergo .
you owe me the dry cleaner s fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another , uhh . . .
twenty seven hundred .
yeah . that was a good party .
you know , marty , you were good in the cyclone .
well , you had it down cold . watching you in the movie , if i did not know better i would have to believe you were a made guy and not acting . even the fink part . i never met a fink and i hope to god i never do , but how you did it must be the way finks act .
a few weeks before shooting , i went back to bensonhurst , just to listen to you guys . see , i am italian , but i grew up in tarzana . so i wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech .
we talk different ?
it is more like your attitude . your tone , your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves , in your opinions , your indifference to conventional views .
you mean like we do not give a shit .
so you do not know what i am thinking .
no , i do not . though i have to say i am curious .
so you want to know .
if you would like to tell me , yeah .
i am thinking of a movie .
one of mine ?
one we are producing .
martin , i am not connected to those people anymore . not since i walked out of a loanshark operation in miami .
what happened ? the pressure got to you ?
guy owes me fifteen large and takes off , i go after him . the fuck you think i do ?
martin , look at me .
no , i want you to look at me the way i am looking at you . put it in your eyes , you are mine , asshole , without saying it .
like this ?
what you are telling me , you are tired ? you wanna go to bed ?
wait . how about this ?
how about this ?
that is not bad .
that is what i think of you , asshole . nothing .
i believe it .
i turn it on when i confront the guy .
yeah , but you have not found him yet . the guy took off for las vegas .
the wife sues the airline . this is a gutsy babe .
so when do i meet up with the husband and give him the look ?
it is not that simple . you have to be careful . there s another guy that comes along , a hard on you owe some money to . a mob guy . wants to take you out anyway , on account of a past situation .
at that point , basically , that has to be it .
lemme talk to buddy , set up a meeting .
very nice . . .
yeah , i like it , i am high up , i can see everything , you know ? it is the cadillac of minivans .
that is that ?
compass .
whatta you think , chill ?
i would not think you are that dumb , leave over three hundred grand in the closet , underneath the extra blanket , but i guess you are .
i did not know where else to keep it . where would you ?
you are here a while , that is wrong with a bank ?
they report it to the irs .
you have been losing .
i am up twelve grand today .
from when ? you left vegas with four fifty ?
who told you that ?
now you are down to three ten in the case . you must have cooled off quite a bit since you got here .
how would you know i was here ?
it was fay , was not it , told you about the money . she tell you my whole life history , for christ s sake ?
i would not let her if she tried . why i am here , leo , basically , is to save your ass .
how ? by taking my money ?
you can keep what you won today . that is yours .
it is all mine .
you take all my money , but you are borrowing part of it ?
but you will not know where i am . i do not even know where i will be .
it is not one of these ?
you see a black leather jacket , fingertip length , like the one pacino wore in serpico ? you do not , you owe me three seventy nine .
we call you a taxi .
lemme get this straight . you are not responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine , but you are gonna find ray bones coat or get him a new one ? is that what you are telling me ?
mr . barboni is a good customer . works for jimmy capp .
the door from the patio , in back .
you broke in ?
no , it was open . it was not locked .
well , basically , this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand , plus he is a few weeks behind on the vig , the interest you have to pay .
the interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand ?
that is right . three percent .
but a week . that is a hundred and fifty percent a year .
a hundred and fifty six . some will charge you more n that , go as high as six for five on a short term loan . so three a week s not too bad .
a couple days ago by , people from the airliner come to see his wife , tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement , the amount based on what he would have earned operating the dry cleaner s the rest of his life . leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys , so they were giving him about ten years .
hey . . . karen . how ya doing ?
what are you doing here ?
i wanted to come by , apologize for coming into your house like i did last night .
lemme get this straight , you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before ?
no , no . . . you left the patio door open . you gotta stop doing that , all the nice things you got around here .
yeah , well make sure you lock it on the way out .
rough day on the set ?
i spent all day crawling out of a grave . the costumer kept bitching cause i was ripping my nylons
ripped nylons work . makes the shot more real .
. . . that is what we finally decided .
you saw that one ?
yeah . when you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished . . . when you give us all that look , joan crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence . not even in mildred pierce which by the way was a better book than a movie did crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look .
yeah . . . that was a good scene . i mean , for a horror movie .
for any movie .
i know i am better than what i have been doing the last ten years , walking around in a tank top and fuck me pumps , waiting till it is time to scream .
man , can you scream .
yeah . it is a real gift . i am just saying it would be nice , one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line . you know , like in that bette davis picture , cabin in the . . .
cotton .
how come you stopped making movies with harry ?
i married martin . that was a full time job .
you read harry s new one ? he says it is the best thing he is ever read .
he must mean after slime creature .
that why harry came over last night ? see if you could help him get martin in his movie ?
harry s dreaming of a forty million dollar production he will never get off the ground with a star he will never sign . with or without my help .
harry told me martin loves it , he flipped .
yeah , well martin is known for his flipping . he flips over a script , and when the time comes to make a deal , he flips out .
tell you what , i will stop by harry s office and pick up a copy for you .
well , i gotta have a talk with leo , my runaway dry cleaner .
right . see how your story ends .
you been here the whole time ?
i got you a copy of the script .
i already read it . harry left a copy at the house .
i think it is not horrible .
i do not like the title . or the main guy s name .
then you have read it ?
not yet .
you and harry will make a great team . i am gonna make a deal with him .
there a part in it for you ?
i do not want to act in it , i want to produce it with harry . especially if i help him get martin .
sounds fair .
that why you came over here , to ask me that ?
i want to know .
why does anyone want to be in movies ?
i was never much into it . all that bullshit having to do with respect . it is bad enough having to treat those guys like they are your heroes , having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think s real funny .
and you think the movie business is any different ?
this thing s actually accurate . i bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on sunset . . .
well actually , martin the movie we came to talk about is mr . lovejoy .
a locker at the airport ? jesus christ , harry . tell me you are not really that stupid .
that was martin . he wants to have lunch tomorrow . that is , if you can make it .
depends , who pays ?
how would you meet martin anyway ?
not unlike the way nicki met him . except it was a wrap party . why ?
i do not know , i am just having some trouble seeing you two together .
you do not like martin much , do you ?
oh , i like him . i just think he is . . . short . i mean , he is a good actor and all , but i am wondering what it was exactly you saw in marty .
so what about your story . you thought of a title yet ?
how about get shorty ? except that is not a movie . that is real life .
how about chili s hollywood adventure .
yeah ?
yeah . there s a girl in it now .
i think you could be an actor . i know you are acting sometimes , but you do not show it .
you thought i was faking ?
no . i do not mean that . i just meant in general .
you do not mean a movie star ? more like a character actor ?
i mean i could see myself in movies robert de niro had been in . or i could maybe do an al pacino movie , play a hard on . but i could not see myself in ones , like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby . they do not know how to take care of it and you see these big grown up assholes acting cute
harry . . . my god . . .
what kinda food they serve at this ivy place anyway ?
why not ?
harry , what are you doing ? you are supposed to be in the hospital .
you sure ?
he is doing the same thing you did to him , playing letterman on tv .
it is not dave . it is a movie .
are you going down ?
i do not know .
you are as bad as harry . . .
you okay ?
karen ! what the fuck are you doing ? !
were you scared up there ?
you bet .
you do not act like it ?
i will be right back .
what took you so long ?
they are closing the granview . you know , theater down on biscayne ?
yeah , the guy owes momo a few g s .
momo could buy it , i could run it for him . show some cagney films .
you sure it was ray bones took the coat ?
that is what the guy said .
hey , chili . get your coat , but do not piss the guy off , okay ? it could get complicated and we would have to call momo to straighten it out . then momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we do not need that .
no , i said i am never going to bed . there s a difference . see , the article says most people die in their beds . i figure long as i stay outta bed , i am safe .
that is the dumbest thing i ever heard . where do you sleep ?
i told you not to
i hate to say i told you , but i did . i told you do not start nothing with him that time .
you said do not say nothing and i did not .
no , you just broke his fucking nose instead .
you gonna start that again ? you are just like him , all you got room for in your brain is one fucking thing .
all i know is he came by the barber shop , all fucking undone , wanting to know where you were staying in vegas . i told him i do not know . i still do not .
how would he know i was in vegas ? you tell him ?
he already knew it .
yeah , well , i am in l . a . now .
whatta you doing out there ?
i am going into the movie business .
what are you talking about ? you wanna be a movie star ?
i am thinking about producing .
how you gonna do that ? you do not know shit about making movies .
i do not think the producer has to do much , outside of maybe knowing a writer .
yeah , but whose point of view ?
whatta you mean , whose point of view the audience s point of view .
all these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene .
what emotiong ? girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick .
yeah ? what three words , harry ?
pick ng save .
hm ?
so mildred says to the cashier , i saw the new streisand picture . god , i just love it at the end when she brushed robert redford s hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together , and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other , but knew they could not be together . that look was so . . . romantic .
that is great , harry . so that is the
hello , doris .
well , are not you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like ?
what a spectacular view .
i miss murray , harry .
yeah , me too . he was a helluva good writer . and i would know . i discovered him . made him what he was .
i am not sure how i feel about this , doris .
you seem to feel fine about it .
i mean morally . murray was my friend .
so this means you have reconsidered our deal on mr . lovejoy ?
no . but now that you mention it , i did talk to a handsome executive at paramount the other day . . . who just happened to get his hands on the script .
yeah , what would he have to say ?
he said if martings interested , i could get a half a million for it easy . but do not worry , harry , i am still giving you until friday .
that is wrong ?
be quiet and listen .
when i came upstairs , you stayed to finish your drink . i told you to turn off the tv when you were through . come to think of it , i also told you you could sleep in the maid s room .
yeah , well i turned off the set . i used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor . you know what could have happened ? the dog came in and stepped on it , turned the tv back on .
i do not have a dog .
you do not ? what happened to muff ?
anyone skim the pool ? it needs it .
harry
how did you get in the house ?
he is telling me an idea for a movie . it is not bad so far . sit down , have a drink . tell karen , let s see what she thinks .
that miami flight that went down , it was on the news every day for about a week . harry must have been busy .
with your experience , you could always become an agent . right , harry ?
yeah , that is what we need . more agents .
well . i got an audition tomorrow .
what i am saying , harry , is i want you and your new buddy to get out of my house .
harry , what are you still doing with those guys ?
harry , we spoke with martin .
we ?
harry
which two ?
once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them , it not only heightens the tension , it adds a wistful element to their love .
i have to run . but what i hope to see , they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money . it becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it , but in the end they cannot . can they ?
what money ?
the three hundred large . what other money is there ? i should keep quiet , i know , till i have read the script , but i have got a feeling about this one . i am that shylock .
karen . wow . look at you . . .
i am sitting here , i am looking at you and i am having these flashes . you know , flashbacks , of memories . of us .
really .
yeah and i am wondering , how did it go wrong ? how did it all . . . slip away ?
oh , for christ s sake
lufkin . his . . . agent .
yeah , karen knows him .
but you are interested ?
hi , sweetface . you look great . and mmmmm , you smell good , too .
i have to consider , i mean , as the mob guy , this is another mangs wife i am sleeping with .
arctic warrior , arctic warrior , arctic warrior . this is united states coastguard station north island . over .
north island , i wish to declare myself salvor in posession under section four two charlie of the international maritime convention .
affirmative , arctic warrior . what type of vessel ?
a passenger liner . over .
a passenger liner , north island . over .
what is the vessel name , registry , and present position ? over .
passenger vessel chimera . i will spell charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha . no registry information is available at this time . i have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west , five seven north at . . . two zero one four hours zulu time . over .
affirmative , arctic warrior . please advise your salvage authority pending registry check . over .
north island , please repeat ? over .
north island , have you got any additional information ? over .
roger , north island . i am tied to the passenger vessel chimera . and she is afloat . repeat , she is afloat . over .
roger , arctic warrior . i say again , our records indicate the passenger vessel chimera was lost at sea . over .
roger , north island . please advise pending further information . over .
arctic warrior , arctic warrior , arctic warrior . this is united states coastguard station north island . your radio check is affirmative . over .
hear that , dodge ? epps do not think it is a problem .
looks like epps gonna get some tonight .
hypothetically speaking , what if we get this boat to sitka and find out somebody wants it back ?
they shoulda thought of that when they let her float away .
you think the extra strain caused it ?
how about now ?
sixty pounds .
what ? you sure ?
that is what it says .
are you crazy ? do you realize we got ourselves a ship ? we own a ship , dodge .
fucker !
take it easy , dodge . it is only a piece of metal .
damn mind of it is own .
one minute i am minding my own business , the next thing i know the whole place is burning up . an oxygen tank must have blown on the welder . started an oil fire .
that is so great about sweden ?
yeah , but not as cold as those swedish girls you only gonna dream about .
where is his boat , then ? where is his crew ? he ai not gonna be out here by himself , that is for damn sure .
let s not be too hasty .
i need lag bolts , especially one inch standard . and sheet metal . preferably steel , about a sixteenth of an inch . aluminium , even tin will do .
i ai not no mechanic , just so you know .
what day is it ?
i do not know . tuesday ?
when they find out what it is carrying , they may not be so interested in that is legal .
the turbine blew .
you would think on a ship this size there would be something left to eat .
where from ?
one more ?
what is your first name ?
what ?
maureen .
what ?
maureen .
roger .
roger ?
you think that is funny
probably slipped her moorings , got tangled up in a current .
out here ? what , so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now ?
seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds , it ai not gonna be what you would call easy . any questions ?
supposing one of those cables breaks under tow .
ready ?
nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either .
if this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago , we just hit the jackpot .
last thing we want is extra partners .
this s gonna hurt a little .
what other choices have we got ?
guess i will just keep working .
what are you crazy ?
light in those passages ai not so good .
maybe that is his boat .
fifty million dollars . fifty million . we gonna let this guy just take it from us ? one guy ?
so we kill him ?
one guy is not gonna be so stupid .
pretty handy with that scatter gun , epps . you raised on a farm ?
smokes ?
i am no doctor . but i would say he is in a coma .
a what ?
i do not know what else you would call it . he is breathing on his own , but his pupils are completely blown out . he is totally unresponsive to pain . what happened up there ?
other than the obvious , there s nothing wrong with him that i can see , not on the outside .
try wednesday .
did you ?
what say , epps ? you up for some roasted albatross ?
dodge . dodge .
what ?
get up .
you are not jealous , are you dodge ?
what the hell would a freighter be doing up here ? it is way out of the lanes . there s not a port for miles .
yeah , from one side of the harbor to the other . but we got half the bering sea and the whole alaskan gulf to drag her over .
you have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage ? the fittings alone could go for a few million .
if you get it back in one piece .
it is a bloody navigation hazard . one boat cannot control a ship that size .
with a little extra fuel , weather permitting , we should make sitka in five days without another stop .
mother fucker !
what is it ?
the number one turbine s pretty well trashed . number two runs , but it is way underpowered .
how long to fix ?
that is this ?
turbine rotor s shot .
i thought you said it was just a blade .
metal s crystallized . gotta replace the whole deal .
how much longer s that gonna take ?
like i always say
i know i know , two ways to do anything
the right way and the wrong way .
but how long ?
hard to say .
we gotta get outa here , dodge . a storm blows up and we are history .
i am telling you , you do not want to be running that fan like it is .
what about running number two by itself ?
it is a full horses down . we could not drag that boat down hill on ice with it .
how long , then ?
i gotta pull the blades and re seat everything in a new rotor .
how long ?
three , four days .
goddamit , dodge .
obviously it is some kind of screw up . the shipping records are not a hundred percent accurate .
went aboard .
it is a hell of a lot of money .
what , you think there s something funny about it ?
did not happen yesterday , i will tell you that . torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat .
or somebody stopped them .
so what are we gonna do . that is the big question , right ?
a salvage claim to a vessel s cargo s as valid as a claim to the vessel itself . it is ours .
then we are rich . we are damn , filthy stinking rich .
you gotta be kidding ? what the hell we need that tub for , we got fifty million bucks ?
yeah , yeah . i am on it .
i am buying me a nice outrigger . spend my time hauling rich seattle business men through the puget .
dreamings all any of you are gonna be doing if we do not get this boat running .
sounds like the hull .
if somebody s aboard her already , she ai not ours . she is theirs .
bullshit . that boat has not made steam for fifty years . we found her . she is ours .
i say fuck the motherfucker . we are a professional salvage crew going about our business . that is some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway ?
and what do you propose ? that we knock this guy off ?
what if that fucker finds it before we are ready to go ?
if he is reasonable , maybe we can make some kind of deal . if not . we will have to re consider our options .
bodies are too fresh .
damn barbaric is what it is .
that would be my guess .
cannot you use something else ?
i might be able to find something on the ship . but it is gonna take time .
do what you need to do . just do it fast .
dodge to murphy .
murphy .
you better get down here quick , skipper . i am on c deck . cabin .
what is it ?
it was a mangs voice . repeating some sort of childrengs rhyme . i do not know , it did not make any sense . you did not hear it ?
on a passenger ship in ?
so . i got a question . just from a , you know , purely technical standpoint . we call the coastguard . coastguard shows up . what exactly is the plan ?
how do you mean ?
well , they are gonna be asking a lot of questions . about us . about those bodies . about the gold . seems like we oughta be prepared is all .
i guess the best strategy s just to tell them the truth .
yeah , well . the truth is one thing . when there s more than a few hundred million dollars involved , that is a whole new deal .
what do you propose ?
there s no way we are gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the coastguard here . besides , it will be safer where it is .
just what the hell do you think you are doing ? !
i do not know what you are talking about ?
i think you know .
the radio !
take it easy , willya ? what about the radio ? !
you smashed it !
what ? !
do not lie to me !
what the fuck ?
you did not want us calling anybody . too liable to ruin your big payday .
i did not touch the fucking radio ! ever occur to you there s somebody else on that boat , skipper ?
conveniently enough for you .
yeah .
what the hell happened !
that oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants .
if money can buy what he wants .
i do not figure there s much i want money cannot buy .
we will stand the watch on deck tonight . you are up first .
tomorrow we will see if we cannot find some line and tackle . use some of those bodies below decks for bait .
you are late .
sorry .
do not fall asleep .
that is slow ?
morning everybody .
show your tatoos to that coxswain last night , did you epps ?
showed him a hell of a lot more than that .
could be a fishing boat .
looks like one hell of a stick up his ass .
you mean , before she sank .
then why did not they take it .
two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold .
that is what i call a payday .
that is a good thing ?
what would he look like ?
coffee .
stay away . or else .
any dizziness ?
no .
headache , nausea , lights ?
lights ?
sudden flashes of light .
i do not even want to know what that is gonna taste like now .
you okay ?
yeah . fine . i just thought i heard something is all .
what ?
i cannot believe you . dodge s dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share .
candy ?
go on .
the law s on our side . if they want to challenge it , let them try .
coffee ?
what would you find up there ?
some charts . a crew manifest . looks like her last voyage was january . the question is where the hell s she been since .
she was sailing up north , right ?
her destination was halifax , yeah .
ever heard of the mary celeste ?
nope .
she was a two masted brig boat sailing out of new york in . one day she was sighted off the coast of portugal by a merchant vessel , the dei gratia . as the crew of the dei gratia got closer , they discovered that no one was at the helm of the mary celeste . on boarding , they found her completely deserted . the captain , his wife , their daughter , and the entire crew , all gone . the last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble . the table was even set for dinner . and in the nine days after the last entry , she sailed miles without anyone aboard .
so what did happen ?
nobody knows . there have been a lot of theories , of course . but we will never really know for sure .
i think we would be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current .
you are more practical than superstitious .
maybe they did not want it back . maybe the whole fat deal was insured .
why not call for help ?
take it easy , you will live longer .
did you see him ?
who ?
the guy . he just came this way .
what guy ?
there s somebody else on this boat .
what ? what the hell are you talking about .
i saw him . just a minute ago . some guy .
are you sure ?
of course i am sure . i saw him .
you sure it was not me ?
so , we find this guy and make a deal with him .
guess that would be me . again .
no cowboy shit up there , understand ?
got your light ?
murphy to epps .
epps .
you just shoot at something ?
just before i heard him yell there was somebody on the radio .
greer ?
he needs a doctor .
how is he doing ?
same . any luck ?
they are dead in the water that morning . four hours later the captaings relieved of his command . and that evening they issue a general sos .
you are saying they mutinied for the gold ?
if they were close enough to shore , they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats .
the ah . . . the radio s out .
what ?
smashed it up pretty bad .
the crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill .
february first .
the same day she supposedly went down .
their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision . distress calls have been made .
collision ? with what ?
the page s missing . then their sos was real .
but where is the damage ?
maybe the other ship took the worst of it .
it is a good bet they will be asking a lot of questions when they get here too .
it is not gonna hold us .
hey .
hey .
could not sleep .
what do you think happened on this boat ?
i guess that is the sixty four thousand dollar question , is not it ?
the what ?
never mind . before your time . i think at least some of the crew went a little nuts . the usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune . equal parts greed and paranoia , usually resulting in homicide . what happened after that is anybody s guess . but , judging by our greek friends down below , it does not look like the last time .
are we smart enough to avoid that ?
when you found me yesterday , at the pool . i would seen . . . something . someone .
not our mystery guest again .
what , like some kind of ghost ?
maybe hallucination is the wrong word . it was more than that . as though they were showing me .
showing you what ?
what happened .
maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those greeks .
no . i think they are , were , just passengers . innocent victims .
victims of what ?
something bad happened here , murphy .
that much i think we have already established .
she said the ship was evil . that we had to leave right away . that if we did not , we might never leave .
that is that supposed to mean ?
why you ? how come the rest of us have not seen these people ?
murphy to epps .
epps , over .
nope .
epps ? you there ?
what do we do with him ?
what do you think ?
could be a stroke . who knows ? the general log said the crew were fighting among themselves . like wild dogs .
over the gold .
they went crazy .
hard to say which is worse , staying here or taking our chances in open water .
if the weather holds it might not be so bad .
what happened ?
we hit land .
what ?
we are in an island chain . it is only a matter of time before we hit another one .
you killed them .
it was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody . you saw it coming as well as i did . dodge had his plans , starting with scuttling the boat . and greer too , except he went nuts . could not take it , i guess . could have happened in the middle of downtown anchorage . but did it make him any less dangerous ? i do not think so .
so you killed them ?
the way i figure it , it was them or me . i thought putting dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch ? bought a little time . made it look like whoever killed those greeks was still around . but it is just us on this ship . us and your . . . spirit friends .
and now you are gonna kill me , is that it ?
i did not want it to turn out this way .
murphy , do not you see that is happening ?
i think i see it pretty well .
it is the ship . the ship s making you think this way .
i know a little bit about human nature and what i have seen only confirms that .
it is a trap . there was no way we were gonna get away with that gold . nobody ever does . it is just the bait . this ship sucks people in and it never lets them out .
i think maybe you been on this boat a little too long , with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo . there s nothing supernatural about greed . and that is what it comes down to , pure and simple .
i do not give a damn about the gold .
greer to murphy .
the number nine on the starboard side s half flooded . epps says it is a slow leak just under the waterline , about twenty gallons an hour . they must have pumped it before we left sitka .
of course they did .
let the buyer beware .
not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to russia .
he will sell the scrap for three times what he paid .
i must be in the wrong business .
you got that right .
red sky at night , sailor s delight .
yeah .
i been watching it for close to an hour and it has not moved . i cannot raise it on the radio either . makes me think it might be in trouble .
too deep to anchor out there .
call the coastguard ?
it is funny .
how is that ?
murphy , goddamit .
whatever the reason , she is adrift and abandoned . we have got every right to salvage her .
you mean tow her back ? that is a thirty thousand ton ship you are talking about .
all we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it .
some classy tub in it is day , huh ?
morning .
you are up late .
how much you figure that is worth , skipper ?
hard to say . maybe forty , fifty million .
if they thought it was lost at sea , they probably just wrote it off .
so what ? we gonna unload the gold and get a move on ?
yeah , but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to sitka .
i heard that .
what now ?
we could call for help .
fifty million four ways . that is twelve million and change a piece . what you gonna do with your share , skipper ?
greer ?
i do not know .
let s just take it easy here , alright ? nobody s gonna kill anybody .
i say we off load some of that gold now .
pretty low all around .
ho ly shit .
greek citizen . merchant navy . obviously we are not the first to come across this ship . they probably stumbled across it just like we did .
maybe epps s mystery man had something to do with it .
never been more thirsty in my life .
how are you feeling ?
what happened ?
you do not remember ?
last thing i remember i was aboard the chimera . down somewhere in there scavenging around .
you have been out for about a day .
say what ?
oh , man .
we heard you scream . any idea what you might have seen ?
we are not gonna be able to pump it !
we ai not exactly in what you would call your high traffic neighborhood either .
getting a little hot under the collar , i would say .
shut up .
it is a noaa buoy .
a what ?
we are still drifting .
he took the shotgun and a light .
cannot find the shotgun .
so whoever did this now has our shotgun .
what about the gold ?
leave it .
now hold up just a minute . let s be reasonable here .
you think whoever did this is reasonable ?
nobody s going anywhere with that gold now . anybody tries to board , we will know about it . you can do what you want , greer . but neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that .
what seems to be the trouble , ladies ?
as i said , what seems to be the trouble ?
did not you hear me , grandpa ? or you got your hearing aid turned down ?
these ladies was having themselves a discussion and you are interrupting it .
you got about two seconds to get your paws off me , tarzan .
i thought you say tuesday .
better late than never .
that is this ?
you got a leak in the number nine compartment .
no , no . you got leak .
you pump it out and re seam the hull , she will be good as new .
that cost me twenty grand at least .
fifteen , at the most .
you are kidding , right ?
have you seen my blue spatula ?
nope . what are you making , pancakes ?
will you get off my back for once ?
it is tough to find a good job without any kind of training .
look , i told you i am not going to college .
well , i think it is good to keep all your options open . you can always enroll for the winter quarter . you could even live here and go to the city college part time , and still get a job if you wanted to .
did i tell you who i ran into at the bagel place ?
who ?
guess .
how should i know ?
someone from the past .
who ?
give up ?
yes .
maxine .
not the maxine ?
yup .
hi . look , i am kind of tired i think i will go to bed .
i made spaghetti . do you want some ?
i have some good news for you , pumpkin .
what is it now ?
are you still looking for a job ?
i guess .
well , maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at computer station . normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience , but she thinks she can convince them .
pumpkin ? that is wrong ?
it is nothing it is just some hormonal thing . . . do not worry about it . . .
i have got some important news to tell you , but it can wait till later if you are not feeling . . .
what ?
pumpkin , are you in there ?
are you going to yell at me ?
about what ?
yeah , i heard about that .
i was in a horrible mood tell her not to worry , i will be completely out of her life in a few days .
she understands what you are going through and she really wants to help you . she says that job at computer station is still available if you want it .
i i am not sure . . . yeah , maybe .
actually , i was just checking to see if you were here your friend seymour is on his way up .
what do you mean on his way up ! ?
that is wrong with you ? ! tell him i am not here !
but i cannot
that was great jeez , thanks again for cooking all this .
here we are . . . it is mocha mint from lickety splits . oh , is not that photograph just heart rending ?
yeah . . . where is this ? bosnia ?
was it bosnia ? i forget . . . it is so sad , the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy . a soul funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention . she goes over and turns it up .
oh , i just love this song ! is not it great ? does not it make you want to dance ? c mon !
uh , well , that is okay i do not dance , heh , heh . . .
do not be silly , anyone can dance . here , just follow me . . . watch my feet .
hey , it is nearly nine already we are gonna have to leave now if we are going to make that movie .
i am so excited to see this film dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director ! did you see his last film , the flower that drank the moon ? it was simply glorious !
uh , no . i missed that one . but what do i know ? i like laurel and hardy movies .
seymour ? . . . uh . . . hello . . . i guess i am a little early . . .
dana ! hi ! uh , dana . . . this is enid . . .
seymour ! hello ! what are you doing here ?
oh please do not let me interrupt finish your phone call .
hey . . . so , what brings you down here ?
i uh . . . i feel that i need to uh there s something i feel i have to say . . . i uh , i have never said this to anyone before believe me , i have stayed in horrible relationships for years just so i would not have to do this , but i uh . . .
what are you trying to say ?
i i honestly never intended for this to happen . . .
please tell me it is not that teenager !
enid and i were just friends . you know . . . we feel comfortable around each other . . . she really likes my old records and . . .
and what can you tell us about this . . .
who is this , enid ?
it is supposed to be don knotts .
and what was your reason for choosing him as your subject ?
i dunno . . . i just like don knotts .
these are all valid comments , but i think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this .
well , i got the idea when i was doing some research and i discovered that cook s chicken used to be called coongs chicken , and so i decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism . . . and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture . . .
did you actually do this painting ?
well , no it is more like a found art object .
and how do you think this addresses the subject of racism ?
it is complicated . . . i guess i am trying to show how racism used to more out in the open and now it is hidden , or something . . .
and how does an image like this help us to see that ?
enid , can i talk to you for a minute ?
uh oh .
do not worry it is nothing bad . i was just wondering what your plans were for next year ?
i am not really sure working , i guess . . .
hmm .
as far as i know it includes housing and meals and everything . . . it is really quite an offer . . .
. . . wow . . .
so what do you think ?
i dunno . . . would i have to take classes and stuff ?
well , yes . . .
i . . .
enid ! i am so sorry about what happened .
what do you mean ?
the whole business with the art show and the newspaper it is absolutely
huh ?
did not principal jaffee call you ?
i did not check my messages . . .
oh my goodness . . . well , the whole thing is just ridiculous , and as soon as the school board is back in session next fall i am going to do everything i can to help you .
help me what ?
well they are forcing me to give you a non passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition . . . but do not worry i am sure i will be able to get you your diploma in the fall !
but . . . can i still get that scholarship to the art academy ?
i am gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself that way i can evaluate your performance while it is slow and ease you into the bigger crowds .
what are you doing ? you do not ever criticize the feature !
why ? what difference does it make ? you already got his money . . .
look , that is the policy . . . if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater . . .
but i was only trying to be friendly . . .
look , we do not pay you to be a movie critic just do your job .
what the hell is wrong with you ? !
what ? i am just kidding around with the customers . . . it is my shtick !
well lose it ! and why are not you pushing the large sizes ? did not you get training about upsizing ?
but i feel weird . . . it is so sleazy .
it is not optional !
well hello there , young employee of the sidewinder .
look , i already told you i am not going to give you a ride .
what can you tell me , young man , about the various flavors of frozen yogurt ?
look , i will be done in a minute . just wait outside .
so josh . . .
that guy rules !
who , doug ? he spends more time here than i do . . .
so josh , will you give us a ride ? please ? pretty please ? it is going to be super fun !
why do you even need a ride ? you could walk there in two minutes .
are not there a million places like this ?
this is the ultimate . it is like the taj mahal of bad , fake s diners .
so , where is weird al ?
yeah , right .
that is not him . . . jesus , stop freaking me out .
in answer to your question , i suppose i endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form . . .
jesus , look at this guy .
forget it .
come on , josh . . . do not you want to see where he lives ?
no .
but this guy is like a one of kind , rare butterfly , and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat . . .
hi josh .
hi .
i just stopped in to say hi .
hi . . . that is up ?
are you the one who left that note ?
do you want something to drink ?
why ?
what do you mean why ?
are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms ?
yeah , right . . .
yeah , right . . . well why not ? that is so wrong with me ?
nothing .
then why do you hate me so much ?
when did i say i hated you ?
you have never once said anything even remotely nice to me .
you make me nervous ! i always feel like you are going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me !
that is just the way i am !
yeah , well
you must have known all along how i you know how i felt about you it must be totally obvious . . . god . . . i always used to dream about this . . .
oh , hi . . .
why do all guys have to play stupid guitars ? it is so typical . . . either they are into cars or guns or sports or guitars . . . it is so obvious . . .
how long have you been up ?
i could not sleep . . . i should get going i feel really weird . . .
do you want to go get breakfast somewhere ?
i do not think we should . . . look , you have to totally promise me you will not tell becky about this .
why not ?
because if you do , i will kill you !
okay . . . i promise .
hi enid .
hey josh .
god , what a bunch of retards . . .
i thought chipmunk face was never going to shut up .
i know , i liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict ! she gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she is little miss perfect and everybody loves her .
what ? . . . oh suck my fucking dick !
what ?
these assholes are saying that i have to go to summer school and take some stupid art class !
why ?
remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year ? i did not think that just because you get an f that means you have to take the class over again .
this is so bad , it is almost good .
just think , we will never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again .
unless they are in your summer school class !
shut up !
uh oh . . . do not turn around . . .
what ? why ?
since when is she an actress ?
oh my god , look ! is stacy himmler going out with rod harbaugh ?
how perfect .
god , just think , we will never see dennis again .
good .
hi .
look at these people behind you . i am totally convinced they are satanists .
why ?
so , when are we going to start looking for our apartment ?
soon . . . i have to wait and see how this summer class goes .
did you sign up yet ?
yeah , i just picked the one that sounded the easiest .
god , it is so weird that we are finally out of high school . . . we have been waiting for this our whole life ! now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want . it is such a weird feeling .
hey , look , the satanists are leaving !
much later .
what do you do if you are a satanist , anyway ?
you know , sacrifice virgins and stuff . . .
maybe there s some weird secret satanic society that meets at the quality cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us .
or maybe not .
maybe they are slowly poisoning us or they are planning to brainwash us and
okay , okay !
authentic s diner ? since when were there mini malls in the s ?
who can forget this great hit from the s ?
hi , al !
i might actually get the pasta special .
did you notice all those weird things on the menu ? like the salad explosion ?
i know . . . and instead of dessert it says mindbenders .
check out the personals . . . maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us .
god , this paper is so boring . who reads all this shit ? here we go . . . windsurfing doctor , mensan iq , maverick sagittarius . let s hit the clubs , make each other laugh !
you can have that one .
okay , well here s yours . . . who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken ? not this one ! stunning bod , very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer .
jesus ! listen to this one do you remember me ? airport shuttle , june th . you striking redhead with yellow dress , pearl necklace , brown shoes . i was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens . am i crazy , or did we have a moment ?
god , that is so pathetic . i bet she did not even notice him .
i know . and he is like psychotically obsessing over every little detail .
we should call him and pretend to be the redhead .
does oomie really like this show ?
so what should we do ?
wait . . . i just want to see that is on this tape .
what is this ?
hey why do you have this ?
you lent it to me in like tenth grade .
look at how cute i am !
look , that is back when i hated you .
i remember every minute of that party .
there s my dad with joanie .
i can never keep them all straight was she the super bitch ?
i want to do him !
i bet ! actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with you always go for guys with some lame , fake shtick .
what are you talking about who ?
that larry guy what look was he going for ? a gay tennis player from the forties ?
hey ! we forgot to call the loser !
which loser ?
you know , the green cardigan guy .
you call .
why do i always have to do it ?
you are better at it .
i remember when i first started reading these i thought dwf stood for dwarf !
what does it stand for ?
god , i think josh is too mature for us .
i know , look at the way he drives . . . he is like an old man .
look , maybe that is him !
i want to make love to him .
shut up !
is he wearing a green cardigan ?
it is obviously him !
that is going on now ? that is he doing ?
that is he doing now ?
do you think he knows ?
are you sure ?
he is insane !
he does not even look that bummed out , really .
i know . . . would not you be totally pissed off ?
this is way too creepy .
he will not see us . . . we will just stalk him from a distance .
the w . c . fields fan club newsletter . . . oh my god , the national psoriasis foundation !
what should we do ? what if he recognizes us ?
ew , look at this . . .
gross !
i think it is cute look at his little weasel teeth .
that was truly pathetic .
he was so excited when you bought that record you are a saint ! . . . god , these apartments are super expensive . . .
it was so cute how he had his own little bags . i thought i was going to start crying ! . . . do you think they are gay ?
what about the striking redhead in the yellow dress ?
oh yeah . . .
he should totally just kill himself . . . hey , here s one . . . oh wait . . . you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats . . .
i dunno . . . i kind of like him . . . he is the exact opposite of everything i really hate . . . in a way he is such a clueless dork that he is almost cool . . .
that guy is many things but he definitely is not cool . . . this one would be okay , but there s no kitchen . . .
yeah , but . . . you know what i mean .
not really . . .
we are not sure yet , that is why we are looking .
funky ?
i have been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we are like these totally rich yuppies . . .
what are you talking about ?
that is who people want to rent to . it is a known fact that it is way easier to get a job and everything if you are rich . . . all we have to do is buy a few semi expensive outfits and act like it is no big deal . . . it will be fun .
you just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you .
just promise you will do it .
what ? how long have you been standing there ?
did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade ?
we still have to go in there sometime .
it is always closed . . .
where are we going ?
let s go hassle josh .
there he is . . .
as always .
waiting for the bus that never comes . . .
i wonder if he is just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or
josh !
i will bet he never jerks off . . .
yeah , he is beyond human stuff like that .
why are we going here ? i hate this place .
what was that all about ?
it is not like i am some modern punk dickhead . . . it is obviously supposed to be a punk look , but i guess johnny fuckface is too stupid to get it !
i did not get it either .
how about this one ?
ew . . . when did you get that ?
this morning at seymour s garage sale .
how about this ?
let s get out of here , this place makes me sick .
we have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before i start my stupid job .
i know a party we could go to . . .
what ? where ? !
it is a surprise .
i do not believe you .
i totally , totally hate you .

just now . . . i went with seymour .
that guy is totally amazing .
god , how can you stand all these assholes ?
i do not know . . . some people are okay , but mostly i feel like poisoning everybody .
at least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining . . .
he is a total asshole . . . he does not even need that wheelchair , he is just totally lazy !
that rules !
no , it does not . you will see . . . you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos .
but those are our people . . .
yeah , well . . . so when are you going to get your job ?
i am working on it . . . i have got a few leads . . . it is just that right now i have , all these projects that take up all my time .
like what ?
nothing . do not worry . . . i promise i will get a job next week .
. . . you do not have to make a million dollars just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment .
i wonder if i hang around with you because you are like my surrogate mother figure or something . like i have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly .
you hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you .
or maybe . . . did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos ? maybe that is why we spend so much time together .
you are gross . see that guy ?
which one ?
he gives me a total boner !
you are just jealous .
yeah , right . . . believe me , at this point i am over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me !
face it , you hate every single boy on the face of the earth !
that is not true , i just hate all these obnoxious , extroverted , pseudo bohemian losers ! sometimes i think i act so weird because i am crazy from sexual frustration .
have not you heard about the miracle of masturbation ?
. . . maybe we should be lesbos . . .
are you kidding ? it is a dream job ! i cannot believe you got a job like that without even trying . . . god , i wish that was my job . . .
yeah , maybe it will be okay . at least i will get to see every movie for free , i guess . . . i had to lie and tell them i already graduated . . .
when are you finally going to get your diploma ?
i dunno , but next week is my last class . . .
anyway , now we can start looking for the apartment . . . do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment ?
was not it like eighth grade ?
seventh . . . you wanted to move out right then !
that must have been when my dad was married to maxine . . .
i remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick daniel dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him .
what are you talking about ? what kind of loser gets fired after one day ? !
this is it ? i cannot believe you are selling some of this stuff .
fuck it . everything must go !
what was that all about ? i thought everything must go !
now are you going to get a regular job ?
do not worry .
if it makes you feel any better , i do not think you could have gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff .
do you want to do something tonight ?
i cannot , it is seymour s birthday . . . shit ! what time is it ? i have to go to the store ! i was going to make him a cake . . .
well , are we still going shopping tomorrow ?
i think one of us should fuck josh . . .
go ahead . . .
no , really . . .
god , you are really obsessed . . .
i am not i just think it would be funny to see what he would do . . .
i thought we decided that josh was way too cool to be interested in sex , and that he is the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that . . .
yeah , but maybe one of us should at least try . . .
look , we have to get these . . .
i cannot afford stuff like this right now .
i am sick of waiting we need to start getting stuff if we are ever going to move . are not these the greatest towels ?
why do you care about this kind of stuff ?
do not you want nice stuff ?
i cannot imagine spending money on towels .
you do not have to . i will pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job .
you are insane .
do you still want to go to that thing tonight ?
what thing ?
that guy s band is playing tonight . . . alien autopsy .
oh yeah . . . maybe . . . seymour s going on his big date tonight and i kind of want to be around when he calls , so i can hear how bad it went .
hello ?
do you still want to do something tonight ?
what happened to seymour ?
i cannot believe it he actually scored !
how repulsive !
so should i come over ?
actually , i am just about to go out with some friends . . .
what are you talking about ? who ?
just some people from work . . .
i do not believe you .
where are we ? this is a weird neighborhood . . .
it is a totally normal , average neighborhood !
i just mean it is weird to me . . . i have never been anywhere near here in my life .
josh says this is a really good neighborhood . . .
what ? when did you see josh ? !
he came into work .
why ? what did he say ?
nothing .
when was this ?
twenty seven fifty three . . . do you see it ? that must be it . . .
great . . .
what ? ! it looks totally normal . . . that is wrong with it ?
i said great . . .
oh yeah , i can tell you really love it !
well , what am i supposed to say ? i cannot wait to live in some depressing shit hole in the middle of nowhere ? !
there s something wrong with every single place we look at ! why do not you just come right out and tell me you do not want to move in with me ? !
you are the psycho ! you have not been able to deal with anything since high school ended !
you are the one who s still living out some stupid seventh grade fantasy !
hello ?
i am sorry about the other day . i do not know that is wrong with me . . . i really do want to move in with you .
i do not know . . . i was thinking maybe i should live alone . i decided to rent that place we looked at . i am moving in next week .
please let me come with you . please please please . . .
i do not know i am not sure it is a good idea .
of course it is a good idea . . . it is our plan .
but how are you gonna pay rent and everything ? you do not even have a job .
so , whaddya think ?
it is fine .
there .
that is all you are bringing ?
i am gonna finish packing tonight . . . i will bring it over tomorrow sometime .
what time ?
i dunno . . .
hi .
oh , hi . . . i almost did not recognize you i think i need to get glasses you are all blurry !
you are lucky then , you cannot see the veins on that guy s biceps .
do you want anything ?
wow . . . finally .
what about me ? am i not even here ?
we are not .
really ? both of you ? . . . why not ?
what are you going to be when you grow up , todd ?
well i am going to major in business administration and , i think , minor in communications .
oh my god , you guys ! i cannot believe we made it !
yeah , we graduated high school how totally amazing .
so what are you guys doing this summer ?
nothing .
i am going to be in this actor s workshop , and i am hoping to start going on auditions soon . i am so excited to finally have some free time . we have to get together this summer !
oh yeah , that will definitely happen . . .
oh my god , what are you guys doing here ?
what are you doing here , melorra ?
my acting workshop is across the street from here . i am just on my break .
well , we will not keep you .
it is really quite something to see you all grown up like this , enid . i would love to hear about what you are doing . i cannot help but feel that i had some small part in how you turned out . . . what are you studying ? you were always such a smart little girl .
may i ask what you are doing ?
shhh !
i want to know what you think you are doing , staying out all night and worrying your father to death !
oh yeah , like he even noticed .
a what ?
a mongoose . . . they eat snakes . . . you never heard of a mongoose ? that is a classic piece of vintage taxidermy . nobody alive today knows how to do work like that .
how much is this ?
perhaps the jam in ator appeals to you . absolutely no practice necessary . you shread like a giant . just press a button .
do you have any other old records besides these ?
seymour does .
who does ?
you still interested in that ?
i thought it was not for sale .
i am thinking maybe i could let it go . . .
do not mind me , i will just be in my room .
did not they tell you ?
tell me what ?
punk rock is over !
i know it is over , asshole , i
if you really want to fuck up the system you should go to business school that is what i am gonna do get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside !
that is not even
oh , how punk .
that tape sucked , by the way !
go die , asshole !
hi . . . that is your name ?
norman .
. . . are you waiting for a bus ?
yes .
i hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago . . . there are no buses on this street .
well , if it is not enid and rebecca , the little jewish girl and her aryan friend .
you are late , asshole .
fine , and how are you ?
you never paid me for that tape with the indian dance routine .
i did too !
tsk ! you jews are so clever with money . . .
thanks for the tape i will have to pay you later , i am broke .
hey , where are you going ?
that is five hundred dollars .
what ?
five hundred .
you are crazy it should be like two dollars !
i was wearing that dress the day i lost my virginity .
well why do i care about that ?
why do you even want it ? it would look stupid on you .
do you have any old indian records ?
indian records ?
you know , like weird s indian rock ng roll music .
those are all s . . . can you play s ?
there s some good stuff in here . . . do you like old music ?
sure , i guess .
is this one any good ?
this track alone by memphis minnie is worth about if you have the original . she was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived , and a great singer and songwriter as well . i know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue .
how much is it ?
a dollar seventy five .
yeah , it took a while before i got a chance to play it , but when i heard that song it was like
so you really liked it ? yeah , there s some really rare performances . you liked that memphis minnie , huh ?
yeah , that is good too . . . the whole record was good , but that one song , devil got my woman i mostly just keep playing that one over and over . . . do you have any other records like that ?
the skip james record ? yeah , that is a masterpiece . there are no other records like that ! i actually have the original of it in my collection . it is one of maybe five known copies .
wow !
do you want to see it ? i can run upstairs and get it . . .
yeah , sure , i guess . . .
oops ! i dropped it !
no ! ! !
what was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks ?
i . . . i did not think you would have any interest in this get together . . . i mean if you had told me you were coming i would have warned you it is not like a real party or anything .
you are right about that . so this is your record collection ?
oh god no . this is just junk i have for sale or trade . the record room is off limits .
really ? can i see it ?
wow ! this is like my dream room ! are these all records !
i have about fifteen hundred s at this point . i have tried to pare down my collection to the essential . . .
god , look at this poster ! i cannot believe this room ! you are the luckiest guy in the world ! i would kill to have stuff like this !
please . . . go ahead and kill me ! this stuff does not make you happy , believe me .
oh , come on ! what are you talking about ?
no you are not ! you are a cool guy , seymour .
yeah right . . . if i am so cool , why have not i had a girlfriend in four years ? i cannot even remember the last time a girl talked to me .
i am talking to you . . . i will bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute !
oh , right . . .
no really . . . i guarantee i could get you a date in like two seconds . . .
good luck . . .
i am totally serious !
yeah , well . . .
i mean it you leave everything to me i am going to be your own personal dating service !
i appreciate the offer but you really do not
mark my words , by the end of this summer you will be up to your neck in pussy !
what about her ? would you go out with her ?
i do not know , what kind of question is that ? i mean it is totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me . . .
but putting that aside for now , would you go out with her ?
okay , what about this one ? are you into girls with big tits ?
jesus !
c mon seymour , i am trying to collect data here ! do not you want me to find you your perfect dream girl ?
i am just not one of those guys who has a type . . .
every guy has a type !
we need to narrow this down somehow . . . we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests .
maybe i do not want to meet someone who shares my interests . i hate my interests ! where can i go to meet the exact opposite of myself ?
yeah yeah yeah . . . just tell me your five main interests , in order of importance .
well , let s see . . . i guess i would have to put traditional jazz , blues , and ragtime music at the top of the list , then probably . . .
so is that your boyfriend ?
josh ? he is nobody s boyfriend . . . he is just this guy that becky and i like to torture .
well are
yeah , sure . . . very funny . . . .
please , seymour . . . becky and i have been dying to go in here but we cannot get any boys to take us . . . please ?
i i would really rather not . . .
we will just go in for one minute it will be a riot !
i do not think so . . .
please ? we have to !
i really do not think it is a good idea .
wow ! look at all these creeps !
shh !
look at this lollipop lolitas is not child pornography totally illegal ?
uh , i do not have much money with me right now .
relax , seymour , relax . . .
so , why did you bring this along ?
i brought it for him to autograph . he is going to be amazed to see it it is one of two known copies . . . i cannot believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner . what an insult !
this bar s going to be packed with girls for you to pick from .
what are we , in slow motion here ? ! what are ya , hypnotized ? have some more kids , why do not you ? . . . for christ s sake , would you move ! ?
yes , that would certainly do . . .
well , offer her a seat ! you want me to do it ?
wait a minute ! hang on ! jesus , i gotta think of something to talk to her about . no ! no . . .
what did you tell that girl ?
i told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label .
jesus . . .
now i remember why i have not gone anywhere in months . i am not even in the same universe as those creatures back there . i might as well be from another planet .
we just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who is not a total idiot , that is all .
look , i really appreciate your help , enid , but let s face it , this is hopeless .
it is not hopeless . . .
yeah , well it is simple for everybody else give em a big mac and a pair of nikes and they are happy ! i just cannot relate to . of humanity .
yeah , well , i cannot relate to humanity either , but i do not think it is totally hopeless . . .
but it is not totally hopeless for you . . . i have had it . i do not even have the energy to try anymore . you should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything i do so you do not end up like me . . .
i would rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar . . . at least you are an interesting person . . . at least you are not exactly like everybody else . . .
i am not sure i have anything to drink . . . there might be some
it does not matter , i am not staying long . . . i just want to make sure i convince you not to give up yet .
wow , this is so cool . . .
if you do not mind my asking why do you care so much if i get a date or not ?
what the fuck , seymour ? ! what is this ?
what ? . . . oh that . . . i borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago . . . i guess it is mine now .
what , are you a klansman or something ?
yeah , right , i am a klansman thanks a lot ! . . . do you know the cook s chicken franchise ?
four piece cook s special deep fried with side ng slaw it is out ray geous !
actually , i was a whole lot more interested in the cook s phenomenon when i was about your age . i have kind of lost interest since i have been working for them . . .
you work at cook s chicken ?
for nineteen years . . .
what are you , a fry cook or something ?
nothing so glamorous . . . actually , i am an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters .
jesus , i would go nuts if i had to work in an office all day .
hey , i get good benefits , a good early retirement plan , nobody ever bothers me . . .
yeah , but still . . .
so , i do not really get it are you saying that things were better back then even though there was stuff like this ?
no , in a lot of ways things are better now . . . i dunno . . . it is complicated . everybody still hates each other , but they know how to hide it better , or something . . .
hey , can i borrow this ?
what ? why ?
i promise i will take good care of it .
i dunno . . . they are very sensitive at work about all this stuff . maybe it would be better if you
you can open your eyes now .
oh . . . uh , thanks a lot enid . . . i really appreciate it . . .
arrrghhh ! ah jeez . . . christ . . .
are you okay ?
what is that ?
oh . . . uh . . . it is just this elastic thing i have to wear for lumbar support . . .
what , like a girdle ?
maybe now you understand why i cannot get a date .
yeah , well , you are not the only one . everybody i know has totally fucked up problems . . . it seems like only stupid people have good relationships . . .
that is the spirit !
i mean , i am eighteen years old and i have never even had a real , steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks !
really ?
never . . .
i am starting to think that even if i did get a girlfriend it really would not change anything .
i know . it is not like it makes all your problems go away .
then again , that is easy for me to say , since i will never even get a date . i am sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you .
actually , i have got a total crush on this one guy right now , but it is a really fucked up situation . . .
oh yeah ?
oh wait , you met him . . . remember that guy josh ? i am like practically obsessed with him , but i cannot do anything about it because becky would freak out .
why ?
never mind , it is way too complicated . . . did you have problems like this when you were my age where you are totally confused all the time ?
i wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them ?
are not you going to get that ?
wow ! what was that all about ?
it is just somebody s idea of a joke . . .
that did not sound like a joke to me . . . what , did you write a personal ad or something ?
uh yeah . a long time ago . . . she called before once . . . it is just somebody trying to humiliate me .
seymour ! i promise you that was not a joke you have to call her back !
how can you be so sure ?
uh . . . hello ?
hi , it is me . . .
oh , hi . . .
so , what happened ?
actually , it is kind of still happening . . . she is over here right now . . . i think everything s going pretty well . . .
what ? you are kidding me . . .
yeah , so i better go it is not really the best time to talk . . .
what , are you going to like have sex with her on your first date ?
boo !
where have you been ? i have been looking all over for you . . . i have been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you . . .
really ?
no , actually joe told me you were here . . . so how come you never call me anymore ?
i know , i am sorry . . . i i have been really busy . . .
yeah , i will bet ! so , how is it going with that is her name ? dana ?
oh . . . pretty well , surprisingly . . . you know . . .
so , what kind of stuff do you guys do together ? is she into old records and stuff ?
sort of . . . she does not dislike any of that stuff . . . she is trying , anyway . . . actually , we are supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon . . .
we really should get together sometime soon . . . i i will definitely call you this week
what , are you trying to get rid of me ?
no . . . no , it is just that i should get going in a few minutes , and
are not you even going to ask me how i am doing ?
i i am sorry . . . uh so . . . uh . . . how
i dunno . . . okay , i guess . . . i fucked that guy josh finally . . .
. . . so . . . is he your boyfriend now ?
i am going to this stupid art show and i want you to be my date . . . there s something i have to show you . . .
i . . . i do not know . i do not really think i should . . .
of course you should . c mon , i am already a million hours late .
. . . i better not . . .
well forget the art show . . . let s do something else .
i . . . i wish i could , enid , but i really cannot right now . . . i it is just that i
well when can we do something ?
oh , uh . . . they were a present from dana .
and you like them ?
well , you know . . . what do i know about clothes . . . i have never been the most fashionable guy it is nice to have someone do all the work for me . . .
so that is it ? you do not ever want to see me again ?
no , of course i do . . . it is just that right now i need to
that is her problem anyway ? did she actually tell you you could not see me ?
no , no . . . not exactly . . . she just does not understand how i would know somebody like you . . .
what does she mean by that somebody like me ?
just someone so young . . .
you must have done something to make her think you like me .
i . . . i do not think so .
does that mean you do not like me ?
no , of course not .
so , do you like me , seymour ?
in what way do you mean ?
in whatever way you think i mean .
i do not know . . . i am sorry , but dana s a very jealous person . i just do not want to screw that up right now . . . i am sure she will dump me soon and we can go back to being friends . . .
i do not think you understand how i really feel about you , seymour .
. . . what do you mean ?
what are you doing here ?
i had to see you .
that is up ?
can you at least let me in ?
uh . . . sure . . . come in .
look , i just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then i will leave you alone .
that is the matter ?
uh . . . i think there s some root beer . . .
that is dana s i am supposed to be saving it for our two month anniversary . you better not
you need a bigger place this is like a little kid s room .
where did you get this ?
dana bought it when we went antique shopping . she said it did not go with her stuff , so she gave it to me . . . she thought it fit in better with my old time thingamajigs .
god , she is going to kill me . . . this bottle is half empty !
that is great ! half empty that is what i like about you , seymour , you are a natural pessimist !
if you expect the worst , you are never disappointed .
what are you talking about ? you are disappointed every minute of your life .
i am just being realistic .
at least you are not like every other stupid guy in the world all they care about are guitars and sports . . . they are all such fags !
i hate sports .
how come in all that time i was trying to get you a date , you never asked me out ?
you are a beautiful young girl . . . i cannot imagine you would ever have had any interest in me , except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity .
yeah , but still . . . it is kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that .
i mean . . . of course i . . . why would not i want to go out with you ?
i dunno . . . i always feel like everybody secretly hates me . i am just paranoid i guess . i mean , you like me do not you ? we are good friends , right ?
yeah , sure . of course .
. . . maybe i should just move in here with you . . . i could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until i get a job .
what about joe ?
oh yeah . . . and dana . . . you were a lot more fun before you met dana . you have been acting way too normal lately . . . you are a bitter , twisted , fucked up guy , seymour , that is why i like you .
you know what my number one fantasy used to be ?
what ?
i used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place . . . do you ever think about stuff like that ?
i guess i probably used to when i was your age .
it would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it , and i would just disappear and they would never see me again .
sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems .
you know what we should do ? let s go get in your car right now and just take off ! we could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life . . . fuck everybody !
i do not think i am in any condition to drive .
i will drive , then we will go out in a blaze of glory !
so where would we go ?
who cares ? let s just go . . . that is stopping us ?
i dunno , i . . .
i am serious ! i am just so sick of everybody ! why cannot i just do whatever i want ?
what do you want ?
what do you want ?
i i i . . .
god , dana s going to kill you !
. . . do you really want us to drive away somewhere ?
what ? . . . maybe . . . no . . . i dunno . . .
i will if you want to .
no . . . forget it . . .
i i never expected anything like this to happen . . .
yeah , well . . . me neither . . .
you must know i always . . . did you really mean all that about moving in with me ?
i was just thinking out loud . . . i mean , you have got this whole thing with dana i am not going to let you fuck that up . . .
but , i . . .
i really want to talk to you . i have been thinking about what you said about moving in here . . .
so that is the story with the two cheerleaders over here ?
they are seymour s .
seymour ? you gotta be kidding me !
do not worry about it . he is not getting any and neither are you .
let me tell ya something , joe . . . listen to me , joe . . . you cannot hit a home run without swinging the bat !
well , here s where the fun never stops !
yeah , i am really , really happy . really having a good time .
where else am i ever going to find another girl who likes geeshie wiley records ? she could at least have the decency to call me back .
maybe she is got another boyfriend .
yeah , well . . . thanks for cheering me up .
please josh ?
so josh , if this guy freaks out , will you protect us ?
i agree .
did you remember to pay the phone bill ?
yeah .
i think that phillip and enid can help us to see that there are many different ways we can express ourselves . we can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues emotional , spiritual , political of great importance . i hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class . who is responsible for this ?
i am .
talk to us about it . . .
it is my response to the issue of a womangs right to choose . . . it is something i feel super strongly about .
what do we have here , margaret ?
i can see that . . . now what can you tell us about it ? first of all , what kind of sculpture is this ?
it is a found object . . . that is when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art .
very good . now , what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent ?
i guess i see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood , because of tea parties in the olden days , but instead of tea i was trying to kind of confront people with this . . . like . . .
this shocking image of repressed femininity !
right , exactly !
uh . . . hi . uh . . . enid s stepmother told me i would find her here ?
she is not at home ?
no . . . they said she was here . . .
what the fuck is she doing ? ! she was supposed to be here three hours ago !
uh , do you mind if i wait ? i really need to talk to her .
are you sure she was not there ? maybe she was just hiding from you .
why would she be hiding from me ?
i do not know . . . where is she , then ?
maybe she is with josh ?
josh ! ? why would she be with josh ?
i do not know .
why ? what did she tell you ?
she just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating i thought maybe she was . . .
what ? is she having some secret affair with josh ?
i have no idea i just want to . . .
why would not she tell me ? there s no way ! she could never keep that to herself . . . you are crazy .
really , i do not know enough about it to . . .
that slut !
why did you say she might be hiding from me ? did she say anything to you about me ?
yeah , she thinks you are a dork .
did she say that ?
look , what do you expect ? considering how we met you .
what do you mean ?
on that pathetic fake blind date .
what are you talking about ?
did not she ever tell you about that ? god , she really is pathological . . .
i have to admit , things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit .
so tell me more about this job . what exactly will you be doing ?
well , mostly archival research , cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their cd reissues . it is really . . . i cannot believe it .
remember what i said when we first started this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you !
it does not pay very much , but i should be able to afford my own place in a few months . . . do you think that is too soon ? i am really anxious to get my record collection out of storage . . .
thank you , doctor .
seymour ?
yes ?
you were contracted to work
malaria epidemic very sudden .
let me see the sick .
oh , you are a doctor now , too ?
there is no reason for fear .
oh , sing a different song , abdullah there s nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is
you do not call me a liar you know nothing of their health consider yourself fortunate i persuaded so many to stay consider yourself fortunate i have decided to stay
he sees this chaos , he will replace you all .
he will replace you , too that is all you really care about .
morning , friend , glorious day .
the next time will be as this time the devil has come to tsavo
that is ridiculous talk and you cannot seriously believe it
i was not and you know it and do not push it just listen we have a problem in tsavo
at last you are right we do you are the problem in tsavo
no hints , samuel .
you do not know all that has happened here the devil has come to tsavo .
i am a man of peace .
am i to take it you want to live ?
most certainly . absolutely . yes .
excellent decision . your name is abdullah ? i am sure we will meet again . go and enjoy the splendid morning .
starting now , we attack them .
how we do not know where they are ?
john henry patterson , come in . i am robert beaumont . firm i like that , tells me a lot about you now why do not you tell me about me ? to get you started , many people find me handsome , with a wonderful smile . i am sure you agree . winning personality , heaps of charm ?
my wife is the game player in the family , sir .
build the bridge over the tsavo river . and be finished in four months time . can you do that ?
i am sure you have examined my record . so you know i have never yet been late on a bridge .
you have never built in africa .
but i have in india every country presents problems .
you will need your confidence , i promise you .
i have got a reason far beyond confidence my wife is having our firstborn in five months and i promised i would be with her when the baby comes .
very moving , patterson i am touched you confided in me . but i do not really give a shit about your upcoming litter . i have made you with this assignment do not make me break you .
pleasant journey ?
lovely sound they seem happy .
do not they , though ?
truthfully ? there has been the occasional odd hiccup but then , as you so wisely told me , i would never built in africa .
i do need to see starling .
starling ?
awhile back he ordered some bibles i have brought them . is he here ?
yes he is .
it is what the natives are calling the lions two lions have been causing trouble
that is the surprise in that , this is africa ?
it has not been that simple so far .
this is supposed to be salvation ? what kind of idiocy are we dealing with here ?
in that half will be bait human bait i will start things off a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor .
are you running a high fever , man ? how could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed ? how could you even conceive of it ?
i did not conceive of it for the lions i built one in india when there was trouble with a tiger .
and it worked ?
what ?
i made a mistake hiring you you are simply not up to the job .
let me explain about time you have been here three months and already two months behind . and the germans and the french are gearing up . and i do not care about you and i do not care about the thirty dead i care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule , i will get my knighthood and i want it . professional hunters may be the answer .
all they will bring is more chaos and we have plenty of that already and if they come in , word will get out and what happens to your knighthood then ?
i am going to try and locate redbeard i assume you have heard of him .
every man who s ever fired a rifle has heard of him by the time you find him , the lions will be dead .
understand , i had help
this sham ? ridiculous . who needs it ? it is only being built to control the ivory trade , make men richer .
then why do you stay ?
i know it is your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey but what are you going to do about it ?
you are certain about tomorrow ? but you do not seem excited .
you do not enjoy killing , do you ?
i am david hawthorne , this is my hospital . and my advice to you is , do not get sick in front of it . that was meant to be charming , sorry . i seem to have lost the knack .
you never had it .
a man eater attacks and you are such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it ?
then he feasted on him , starting with his feet
please you need not be so graphic
that is a terrible idea
is it , i am sorry , but then , of course , you are the doctor , you should know .
silliest thing i ever heard of why in the world should we go through all that ?
i suppose i could answer you . i suppose i could explain that the place is so inviting , what with the smell of blood and flesh , that they have to strike . it is even possible that i tell you i found some fresh paw marks around back which means they are already contemplating feasting here . but i do not want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that i do not have the least idea what i am doing , that i am nothing but an incompetent , that i am a fool . anyone who finds me a fool , please say so now .
i have been desperate for patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived .
i tried to be late , john it would have been easier if you would gone .
we are not much good at goodbyes , helena .
tell me about beaumont does he understand how brilliant you are , how lucky he is to have you ?
oh dear you are geting that downtrodden look again
well , it is just . . . . . . other men do not abandon their wives at such a time
oh please if i would been against your taking this , you would have abandoned me . you have been desperate to see africa your whole life .
what if there are complications ?
go , now . such a gentleman .
very good indeed .
we have hunted since childhood .
all right you will spend your nights inside . you will have plenty of ammunition . you are totally protected , you have really nothing to fear .
not once ? you did not hit it once ?
i would never make excuses but a fire broke out the light was bad he kept moving
well , of course he kept moving but he could not have been more than ten feet away from the three of you surely you must have wounded the thing
many thanks . you are patterson , yes ? nigel starling i will be assisting you at tsavo but surely beaumont must have told you that .
he just gave me his monster speech .
do not much like them .
anything special about them ?
just that they fart through their mouths . must make kissing something of a gamble .
i have lived in africa a year and i do not know what you know . how long have you been here ?
every time i see something like that , i know we are right to be here to bring christianity into their lives , enrich their souls .
beaumont says it is to end slavery .
we all have our reasons . mine is simply to make them understand happiness , accept salvation , know the serenity that comes best i stop . one of the by products of my belief is that i can become amazingly boring . but i know god smiles on me .
samuel is camp liaison absolutely indispensable the only man here everyone trusts .
excellent . could i see the bridge site ?
finish your tour ?
and anxious to get started . what is this , mostly malaria ?
i could not believe it when you said sort it out . as if it were the most normal thing in the world . ho hum , what lovely tea , i think i will bag a killer beast this evening , nothing much else going on anyway .
you said of course you would need the donkey . why of course ?
i do not suppose i could watch .
might be exciting for you .
i have never been all that adventurous . i would not be in the way ?
i would love the company . and i have hunted all my life .
i hate to be a bother , john , but the cramp s getting worse . the pain is actually quite unbearable now .
shhh .
i am sure you mean that to be comforting , but
you will have to deal with it , nigel .
john ? i know this is not the time to ask , but
what ?
since you would only been here three hours when we met , are you sure this is how you hunt lions ?
. . . one shot . . .
with much more on the way john we could have had this chat on flatter ground
how lucky we are .
are not we full of ourselves today ? i think it is because of the lion .
all right thee second embankment will go there .
you do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just there .
in your honor , nigel . and you and singh will be in charge of building them and you will also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars and you will be finished in eight thrilling weeks .
john , it will not be easy .
i will try but this feels so different that old lion i killed could never carry off a man singh s size .
but you said they were always old .
second death ? where ?
far end of camp man wandering alone at night . hawthorne s examining the body now . there s even less of him than of singh .
what a good week .
you mean nobody died ?
i did not have a chance to thank you .
what did i do ?
got me out of trouble .
nonsense samuel would have done something .
we need to talk .
let me save time you are the engineer you are in charge you are sorry i am here . right so far ? good because i am not an engineer , i do not want to be in charge , and i am sorrier than you are that i am here i hate tsavo . so i will help you by killing the lions and leaving , and you will help me by doing what i tell you so i can leave . see any problems ?
actually , no .
all right let s go into battle . i am redbeard .
i do not really . but understand something even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out when i am gone , you will still have to build the bridge . and i do not want the men to have lost respect for you .
that is very considerate .
have you got it ?
the best way to ensure the kill when you are using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter . have you ever led trackers ?
i can try .
samuel says you killed a lion .
it was probably luck i would rather you did the shooting .
. . . misfire . . . it jammed . . .
has it ever done that before ?
think about something else .
have you ever failed ?
goddammit !
meant to ask you the railroad car trap . your idea ? excellent notion i used the same device myself once .
but of course yours worked .
it would have been a beautiful bridge , john . i never noticed before , occupied with other business , i suppose . . . . . . never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but i have had the time today , nothing else on , and this . . . it is graceful and the placement could not be prettier . . . and . . .
in my town , when i was little , there was a brute , a bully who terrorized the place . but he was not the problem . he had a brother who was worse than he . but the brother was not the problem . one or the other of them was usually in jail . the problem came when they were both free togther . the two became different from either alone . alone they were only brutes . together they became lethal , together they killed .
what happened to them ?
their den ? have you ever seen anything like this ?
where could it have gone ? how could it get across the water ? they are only lions , yes ?
they are used to people in trees , not in a clearing . it may be tight .
not for me i am too bulky and it is your idea , you go up there . take the others to the water tower for the night .
i will be bait alone ?
yes . and i will be in some distant tree where i can provide no assistance whatsoever . can you control your fear ?
i will have to .
i cannot control mine i would be lost without the shame factor driving me .
it is certainly the best chance they have had to kill you .
you think they will come then ? why ?
good luck .
why ?
how many do you think they have killed ?
i never thought i would say this , but i am glad you came .
understood you realize now you could never have done it without me .
why do the workers look unhappy ?
it is all wonderfully under control , samuel you have done a splendid job .
thank you . the truth is this you have to work at it constantly .
the workers do not get on ?
did it look like this in your mind ?
i am also liaison between these two .
what are they looking at ?
you they cannot believe you are still here .
nonsense .
we should construct thorn fences around every tent area . fires burning at night .
oh yes , i think so .
for you .
thank you , samuel .
good news ?
i expect so it is from my wife .
do you love her ?
i do , actually very much .
soon .
you like him , do not you ?
oh yes . but it takes time .
you have known him long ?
thank you . why does he need you by him ?
three years i have worked for the railroad . now i do not know why . it seemed a good idea once .
he has children ?
where is it ?
afraid of lions .
why do you laugh ? you do not believe she taught me ?
how many cattle ?
four should do it .
why so many ?
did you ever see a lion that size ?
gentlemen , there s no sickness smell at all here , and little blood . when we leave , close the gate securely , do not open it til morning and keep your fires high . any questions , ask them now . you two will sleep beautifully in your tents . and stay there .
and where will you sleep beautifully ?
where do you go next ?
some russian princes want to hunt the himalayas . you ?
my life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder . our lives have crossed because two lions went mad . but what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity ? was that worth all the lives ? too soon to tell .
some mysteries should not have solutions .
oh , yes , i got in a little late this morning , janosz .
you know , you are really doing very good work here . i think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations .
we will be very sorry to lose you . perhaps i could take you to lunch today ?
every day i ask you , and every day you have got something else to do . do i have bad breath or something ?
i am sorry . perhaps some other time .
janosz ?
do you need anything ? you want me to come in ?
no , everything s fine . honestly . thanks anyway .
okay , just thought i would check . good night , dana . sleep well . do not let the bedbugs bite you .
dana , are not you going to introduce me to your friend ?
what do you want with my baby ?
no harm will come to the child . you might even say it is a privilege . he will be the vessel for the spirit of vigo . and you well , you will be the mother of the ruler of the world . does not that sound nice ?
if this is what the world will be like , i do not want to live in it .
i do not believe we have the luxury of choice .
everybody has a choice .
not in this case , my dear . take a look . that is not gainsborough s blue boy up there . he is vigo !
time is running out , dana . soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine and vigo s . well , mainly vigo s . but we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship .
we do not have a relationship .
i know . marry me , dana , and together we will raise vigo as our son . there are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god . i am sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment . and perhaps a car and free parking .
i hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul . i could never forgive what you have done to me and my child .
many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance , but after a while i believe we could learn to love each other . think about it .
hundreds of people . believe me , i did not imagine this .
what are you working on , egon ?
we will do the happiness index next . i would like to bring ray in on your case , if it is all right with you .
okay , whatever you think but not venkman .
oh no .
do you ever see him ?
occasionally
how is he these days ?
venkman ? i think he was borderline for a while there . then he crossed the border .
does he ever mention me ?
this is my address and telephone number . will you call me ?
certainly .
egon , i would rather you did not mention any of this to peter if you do not mind .
i will not .
frank , do you think you could give me a hand with these bags ?
i am not a doorman , miss barrett . i am a building superintendent .
you are also a human being , frank .
okay , okay . it is not my job , but what the hell . i will do you a favor . he takes the grocery bags from her .
hiya , oscar . what do you say , slugger ?
that is a good looking kid you got there , ms . barrett .
thank you , frank . oh , are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom ? i asked you last week .
no , you did not , frank .
okay , that is no problem .
hello , peter .
you know , dana , i am very very hurt that you did not call me first . i am still into all this stuff , you know . have not you ever seen my show ?
i have . that is why i did not call you first .
so what happened to mr . right ? i hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to europe .
he did not ditch me . we had some problems , he got a good offer from an orchestra in england and he took it .
he ditched you . you should have married me , you know .
you never asked me , and every time i brought it up you would get drowsy and fall asleep .
men are very sensitive , you know . we need to feel loved and desired , too .
well , when you started introducing me as the old ball and chain , that is when i left .
what do you think ?
there s no doubt about it . he is got his father s looks . the kid is ugly extremely ugly . and smelly . you stink ! it is just horrible . you are the stinkiest baby i ever smelled . that is his name ?
his name is oscar .
oscar ! you poor kid !
peter , this is serious . i need to know if you think there s anything unusual about him .
i will do it .
brings back a lot of sweet memories , does not it ? there s our old cash machine . and the dry cleaners we used to go to . and the old video store . we really had some good times , did not we ?
that is where the buggy stopped .
i wish i could stay . i feel personally responsible for you being here .
you are personally responsible . if i can get conjugal rights , will you visit me at sing sing ?
please do not say that . you will not go to prison .
do not worry about me . i am like a cat .
you mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug ?
i am el gato . i always land on my feet .
good luck .
so this is what you do , huh ?
oh , hello , peter .
you are really good , you know .
i am sure you did not come here just to talk about art .
he was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman . i hate this painting . i have felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage .
i may be wrong , but i think you have got a little crush on this guy .
good bye , peter .
i am sorry . were you on your way out ?
no , i just got in a couple hours ago . come on in . are we having a pajama party ?
you know , if anyone else told me that , i would have serious doubts . but coming from you , i cannot honestly say i am surprised .
i must be losing my mind . at the museum today i could have sworn that terrible painting of vigo looked right at me .
who could blame him ? were you wearing this nightgown ?
i do not know what to do anymore .
this is joe namath s old number , you know . you could get a lot of chicks with this . just do not pee in it .
peter , what about the bathtub ?
we will take care of that . ray , pete . listen , get over to dana s right away . . . her bathtub pulled a fast one tried to eat the kid .
it was full of this awful pink ooze .
bathroom s right here let me just tidy up a few things .
be careful on that sofa it is a butt biter . but the bed s good and i just changed the sheets so if you get tired , feel free . in fact , i think you should definitely plan on spending the night here .
really ? and how would we handle the sleeping arrangements ?
for me it is best if i sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me . if we go the other way i am afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night .
how about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby .
or we could do that .
thank you . poor baby . i think i should put him down now .
are you all squeaky clean now ?
they did not find anything ? in the bathtub . . . the pink ooze . . . nothing ? so , what do i do now ?
now you get dressed and we go out . i got a babysitter and everything . trust me , you need it .
i am not here to date . i cannot leave oscar in a strange place with someone i do not know .
it is janine melnitz , from my staff . she is one of my most valuable employees .
does she know anything about babies ?
janine melnitz , are you kidding ? do i have a vase ? i brought some of your clothes . wear something intriguing . i brought along some interesting possibilities .
did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here ?
i put them in your hamper . i thought they were dirty .
so are you making any new year s resolutions ?
i want to stop getting involved with men who are not good for me .
does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow , or could you hold off for a few days maybe ?
for one night in your life , do you think it is possible for us to be completely real ?
all right , you want to be real ? so tell me why did you dump me ?
oh , peter , i did not dump you . i just had to protect myself . you really were not very good for me , you know .
i am not even good for me .
why do you say things like that ? you are so much better than you know .
thank you . if i had that kind of support on a daily basis , i could definitely shape up by the turn of the century .
so why do not you give me a jingle in the year ?
maybe i should call janine .
i think he likes you . i think i do too .
that is not true . it was .
that is a terrible thing to say .
hi , ray . it is good to see you . thanks for coming .
no problem . always glad to help and hug .
is this the spot ?
i think we hit the honeypot , boys . there s something brewing under the street .
sorry !
according to my sources , the world will end on february , in the year .
valentine s day . that is got to be a bummer . where did you get that date , elaine ?
i received this information from an alien . i was at the paramus holiday inn , i was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking . then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that is where he told me about the end of the world .
your alien had a room in the holiday inn ?
it may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the holiday inn . i cannot be sure , peter .
can i help you ?
i am jack hardemeyer . i am the mayor s assistant . what can i do for you ?
i am an old friend of the mayor s . i just want to say hello to him .
i know who you are , doctor venkman . busting any ghosts lately ?
no , that is what i want to talk to the mayor about . we did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued , screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you .
that is quite a story .
before you go running to the newspapers with this , would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown ?
look , i have had it with you . get your stuff together , get back in that clown car and get out of here . this is a city matter and everything s under control .
what is it , honey ?
it is that darn ghost again ! i do not know what to do anymore . he just will not leave us alone . i guess we will just have to move .
who are you going to call ?
oh migod ! i am sorry . i did not mean to do that . it was an accident .
what are you doing up here ?
i was trying to get that smelly green thing . the guys asked me to help out . i am like the fifth ghostbuster .
why would you want to be a ghostbuster if you are already an accountant ?
have you made any plans yet ? you know tomorrow is new year s eve .
no , i celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is march first . that way i beat the crowds .
well , good night , louis .
janine , do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home ?
i would like to , but i told dr . venkman i would babysit . do you want to babysit with me ?
i cannot believe a person could actually live like this .
so these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them .
it is really not a bad place . it just needs a womangs touch .
you are really good with children , louis . i can tell . why do not you come here and sit with me ?
motherhood is a very natural instinct for me . i would like to have a baby myself . would not you ?
should we go ?
i do not think we should leave her alone .
i am not sure this is such a good idea ? do they know you are doing this ?
oh , yeah , sure no . but there s really not much to do here and they might need some back up at the museum .
pleasure to meet you . i have seen you on television .
it is a painting i am restoring for the new byzantine exhibition . it is a self portrait of prince vigo , the carpathian . he ruled most of carpathia and moldavia in the th century .
too bad for the moldavians .
we do not go around altering valuable paintings , dr . venkman .
i will let you get back to it . nice meeting you .
dr . venkman ? dana is not here .
i know .
then why have you come ?
you know , i never got to ask you . where you from , johnny ?
this is the one that looked at dana .
it must be the chemical fumes in the studio . people start imagining things
so you see , everything is in order , is it not ?
you pitiful , miserable creatures ! you dare to challenge the power of darkness ? do not you realize what you are dealing with ? he is vigo ! you are like the buzzing of flies to him .
i , vigo , the scourge of carpathia , the sorrow of moldavia , command you .
command me , lord .
i , vigo , the scourge of carpathia
yes , the scourge
the sorrow of moldavia
the sorrow
i command you .
i await the word of vigo .
the season of evil begins with the birth of the new year . bring me the child that i might live again .
lord vigo , the mother , dana , is fine and strong . i was wondering well , would it be possible if i bring the baby , could i have the woman ?
keep that up , mister , and i will find you in contempt .
you have got to do something !
who are they ?
they are the scoleri brothers . i tried them for murder . they were electrocuted up at ossining in . now they want to kill me .
these boys are not playing around .
the witness is leading him . sustained .
sustained . mr . tully , do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case ?
your honor , may i approach the bench ?
can i have some of your water ?
get on with it , counselor !
that is it ? that is all you have to say ?
come on , sherm . you are my cousin . do this for me . i am begging you .
i cannot do it , louis . it is not ethical . i could lose my license .
why cannot you just have them released ? you are a doctor .
i am a dermatologist . i cannot write orders on the psych ward .
sherman , i have done lots of favors for you .
like what ?
i got you out of those bad tax shelters .
you were the one who got me in .
i fixed you up with diane troxler and she put out , did not she ?
yeah , i had to give her free dermabrasion for a year . forget it , louis . i could get in a lot of trouble .
i am telling you , we are all going to be in big trouble if we do not do something fast . that ghost guy came and took my friend s baby and we got to get it back . it is just a scared little baby , sherm .
this is my cousin sherman . sherm , say hello to the ghostbusters . i promised him a ride in the car if he got you out .
hey ! wait ! okay , i will meet you there .
i thought you were like the fifth ghostbuster .
hi , welcome back to the world of the psychic , i am peter venkman and i am chatting with my guest , author , lecturer and of course , psychic , milton anglund . milt , your new book is called the end of the world . is not that kind of like writing about gum disease . yes , it could happen , but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it ?
well , i think it is important for people to know that the world is in danger .
okay , so can you tell us when it is going to happen or do we have to buy the book ?
i predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on new year s eve .
this year ? that is cutting it a little close , is not it ? i mean , just from a sales point of view , the book just came out , right ? so you are not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year . and it is going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie of the week or mini series potential . you would have been better off predicting or even just to be safe .
this is not just some money making scheme ! i did not just make up the date . i have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on new year s eve .
yes , i did . we were city champs .
so , dr . venkman , please explain to the court why it is you and your co defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street .
i will ask you again , dr . venkman . why were you digging the hole ? and please remember that you are under oath .
i had my fingers crossed when they swore me in , but i am going to tell you the truth . there are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding , things that cannot be explained and that most people do not want to know about anyway . that is where we come in .
so what are you saying ? that the world of the supernatural is your special province ?
egon !
hello , venkman .
how have you been ? how is teaching ? i bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours , huh ?
i think they are more interested in my epididymis .
i would like to have a stool specimen
what now , brainiac ?
i think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street .
that is a thousand million electron volts .
you were supposed to help me with this .
vigo the carpathian , born , died
that is it ? i will be back ?
you know , animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters . given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population .
boys , listen . you are scaring the straights . let s save this until tomorrow , okay ?
it is working . the positive gev s are climbing .
so far so good .
pretty impressive , huh ?
it is probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country .
from where neptune ?
they came from ostrov in eastern poland .
who was that ?
some crank . looking for goat hooves . come up with anything ?
this one s interesting . berlin , , a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground . three hundred eyewitnesses .
you might want to check those duke university mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis .
nothing . not a trace .
the new york pneumatic railway . it was an experimental subway system . fan forced air trains , built around .
this is about as deep as you can go under manhattan without digging your own hole .
seems like a pretty open minded guy , huh ?
hey , i did not imagine it . there must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there .
i am egon
no , not exactly a man of the people . also known as vigo the cruel , vigo the torturer , vigo the despised , and vigo the unholy .
six feet seven eight
that is it . it is on the bottom .
if you two are looking for a fight , you got one . who wants it first ? come on , ray . try me , sucker .
it will not work . there s no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell .
i cannot believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there s no way back . sure , it is crowded , it is dirty , it is noisy . and there are too many people who would just as soon step on your face as look at you . but there have got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned out burg . we just have to mobilize it .
something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us
do not shoot ! you will hit ray !
we have found it at every event site we have been to lately .
there s definitely something going on in that studio . the pke levels were max plus and the giga meter was showing all red .
is the line sinking ?
rivers of the stuff !
late renaissance , i think . caravaggio or brunelleschi .
oh , hello , perhaps you could help me . i am looking for an aerosol love potion i could spray on a certain penthouse pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request .
oh , hiya , pete .
so , no goat hooves , huh ?
i knew that voice sounded familiar . that is up ? how is it going ?
nowhere fast . why do not you lock up and buy me a sub ?
great . so what are you guys working on ?
oh , just checking something for an old friend .
who ?
who ? just someone we know .
who ? who ? who ?
aaah ! nobody ! i cannot tell you !
who , ray ?
well , holmes , what do you think ?
that is that ?
i love this . we are onto something really big . i can smell it , ray . we are going to make some headlines with this one .
hey , hey , hey , stresshound ! are you nuts ? if anybody found out about this we would be in serious trouble . the judge could not have been clearer no ghostbusting .
geez , i forgot how heavy these things are .
i am ray
careful , winston . he is a mean one . and to celebrate our grand reopening , we are giving you twice the value with our special half price welcome back service plan .
hold on , ray ! half price ! have you gone crazy ?
you know he ran that last lap in under six minutes ?
oh good , you are here . spengler and i have something really amazing to show you .
and now you are going to eat it ?
this is what you do with your spare time ?
this is an incredible breakthrough , venkman . a psychoreactive substance ! whatever this is , it clearly responds to human emotional states .
like a goat on garbage .
we are running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction .
what kind of tests ?
well , we sing to it , we talk to it , we say supportive , nurturing things
did you find anything at dana s ?
beautiful , beautiful . work with me , baby . just have fun with it . okay , he is playing it cool . let s finish up and get out of here .
what happened ?
do not tell me , let me guess . all you can eat barbecue rib night at the sizzler ?
we are going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho reactive slime flow . we thought you might want to come along .
i think we are going to have to pass on the sewer trip , boys . let me know what you find out .
you should have been there , venkman . absolutely incredible !
yeah , sorry i missed it . i guess you guys did not know about the dress code here . it is really kind of a coat and tie place .
it looks like a giant jello mold .
forget it . the vienna boys choir could not get through this stuff .
i hope we have enough stuff to do the job .
i will keep to the middle of the channel . we are okay to th street , then we will go ashore and take first avenue to th .
i do not think they make nikes in her size .
my fault !
vigi , vigi , vigi you have been a bad little monkey .
i think she looks pretty good here , do not you ?
my great grandparents were swiss . i still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived .
that is your story , pete ?
ready ?
i am ready .
that is it , ray . i have had it . no more parties . i am tired of taking abuse from over privileged nine year olds .
give it up , ray . you are living in the past . ghostbusters does not exist anymore . in a year these kids will not even remember who we are .
ungrateful little yuppie larvae . after all we did for this city .
yeah , what did we do , ray ? the last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise .
does it have any favorites ?
and he did not die of old age either . he was poisoned , stabbed , shot , hung , stretched , disemboweled , drawn and quartered .
you got a flux and a half .
now that is one ugly dude .
huh ? what ?
you finished here ?
what ? yeah .
are you all right ? you coming down with something ?
are you telling me how to drive ?
no , i just thought
are you all right ?
nice going , ray ! what were you trying to do drown me ?
look , zeddemore , it was not my fault you were too stupid to drop that line .
you better watch your mouth , man , or i will punch your lights out .
what are we doing ? ray , i was ready to kill you .
she is moving !
ray ray how do you feel , man ?
i do not care what you say . this could be a major christmas gift item .
right , and the first time someone gets mad , their toaster will eat their hand .
tell him about the toaster .
it better not start yet . i am trying to finish my potholder before lunch .
and pure
kind of makes you wonder , does not it ?
wonder what ?
how deep does it get ? that water s cold and i cannot swim .
my people were not taking any pictures from those slave ships , man . and there was not any statue in charleston harbor to welcome them , either . what are you , dana ?
are not you glad we waited ?
i do not know . it probably would have been the same .
roy ? your clock broke .
nice going , honey . it was brand new .
now where are you going ?
to the bathroom , where do you think ?
hey , sweetheart , will you cut that out ! ! !
uuuuuuugh ! !
is it a star ?
ready ? what is it ?
ummm figure eight ?
incredible ! five for five . you are not cheating on me here , are you ?
no . they are just coming to me .
well , i guess some people have it and some do not .
do you think i have it , dr . venkman ?
okay . just give me a second here . i have to leave now but if you have got some time i would like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me .
eight o clock ?
oh , dana , it is you . . .
hi , louis .
. . . i thought it was the drug store .
oh , no , i feel great . i just ordered some more vitamins . i see you were exercising . so was i . i taped minute workout and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and i got a really good workout . you wanna have a mineral water with me ?
no thanks , louis . i am really tired . i have been rehearsing all morning .
okay . i will take a raincheck . i always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods , but you know that . listen , that reminds me , i am having a party for all my clients . it is gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant . i know you fill out your own tax return , but i would like you to come being that you are my next door neighbor and all . . .
oh , that is nice , louis . i will stop by if i am around .
you know you should not leave your tv on so loud when you go out . that creep down the hall phoned the manager .
oh , dana , it is you .
hi , louis .
hey , it is crazy in here . you are missing a classic party .
well , actually louis i have a friend coming by .
great ! bring her , too . but you better hurry . i made nachos with non fat cheese and they are almost gone . i will make some more though .
fine , louis . we will stop in for a drink .
are you the gatekeeper ?
oh , sure . i am getting used to this .
i am innocent ! honest , dana . i never touched you . not that i remember anyway .
hello . i am peter venkman . may i help you ?
yes . . . well . . . i am not sure . what i have to say may sound a little . . . unusual .
we are all professionals here , miss . . .
. . . and then i opened the door again but it was gone . there was nothing there .
why would anyone make up a thing like that ?
is that your professional opinion ?
no , just that one word zuul but i have no idea what it means .
have you ever thought of moving out at least until this disturbance blows over ?
you play the cello ! it is my favorite instrument .
really ? do you have a favorite piece ?
i would have to say prokofiev s third concerto .
that is a violin concerto .
you really do not act like a scientist .
no ? what do i act like ?
like a used car salesman .
that is too bad .
what ?
uh huh .
well , let s check it out .
you are quite a housekeeper .
i told you , i . . .
damn !
are you all right ?
there s nothing there now and i do not get any significant readings .
this is terrible . either there s a monster in my kitchen or i am completely crazy .
if it is any comfort to you , i do not think you are crazy .
thanks . coming from you that really means a lot to me .
i am a qualified psychologist . i have got a degree and everything . i believe that something happened here and i want to do something about it .
all right . what do you want to do ?
i think i should spend the night here .
that is it . get out .
on a purely scientific basis .
out !
i want to help you .
i will scream .
do not scream .
then leave .
okay , okay . but if anything else happens , you have to promise you will call me .
all right .
okay . then i will go .
goodbye .
great rehearsal .
you heard it ?
you are the best one in your row .
most people cannot hear me with the whole orchestra playing . you are good .
i do not have to take abuse from you . i have other people dying to give it to me .
i know . you are quite a celebrity these days . are you here because you have info . . . about my case ?
who s the stiff ?
the stiff ? he happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man .
he is a very close friend . do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment ?
yes , but i have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant .
cannot you tell me now ?
i will cancel the reservation , i found the name zuul in . . . the roylance guide to secret societies and sects . i do not suppose you have read it .
you must have gotten the last copy .
well , the name zuul refers to a demi god worshipped around b . c . by the . . . that is that say ?
hittites , the mesopotamians and the sumerians . zuul was the minion of gozer .
gozer he was very big in the sumerian religion . one of their gods .
that is he doing in my refrigerator .
i am checking on that . i think we should meet thursday night at nine to talk about it .
i do not think so . i am busy thursday night .
you think i enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients ? i am making an exception because i respect you as an artist and as a dresser .
all right . since you put it that way .
i will pick you up at your place . i will bring along the roylance guide we can read after we eat .
hey , dana . what is it ? what happened ?
we must prepare for the coming of gozer .
okay , i will help you . should we make some dip or something ?
he is the destructor .
do you want this body ?
well , i will just use it for a while and get it right back to you .
actually , it is more of a policy than a rule .
i want you inside me .
i do not know . you have got two people in there already . it could get a little crowded . i want you to close your eyes and relax . now i am going to speak to dana and i want dana to answer .
i am zuul . i am . . .
right . . . you are the gatekeeper . but i want dana . dana , speak to me . . .
there is no dana . i am zuul .
nothing ! we just got rid of that thing in your kitchen .
really ! is it gone ?
yeah , along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions . this one took some work .
this is going to cost you , you know . our fees are ridiculously high .
i trust you are moving us to a better space somewhere on campus .
no , we are moving you off campus . the board of regents has decided to terminate your grant . you are to vacate these premises immediately .
this is preposterous ! i demand an explanation .
fine . this university will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group s activities .
but why ? the students love us !
dr . venkman , we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind . you , however , seem to regard science as some kind of dodge or hustle . your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe , your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable . you are a poor scientist , dr . venkman , and you have no place in this department or in this university .
that is one speedy mutt .
he is a big one . you do not want to mess with that particular breed .
well , that definitely looks like marshmallow to me .
yeah , it is some kind of mallow type substance that is for sure .
you have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street .
i wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area .
hello , i am roger delacorte the head librarian . are you the men from the university ?
yes . i am dr . venkman and this is dr . stantz .
thank you for coming . i would appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly .
that is that got to do with it ?
did you see it ? what was it ?
you are very handy , i can tell . i bet you like to read a lot , too .
print is dead .
that is very fascinating to me . i read a lot myself . some people think i am too intellectual . but i think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time . i also play racketball . do you ever play ?
is that a game ?
it is a great game ! you should play sometime . i bet you would be good . you seem very athletic . do you have any hobbies ?
i collect spores , molds and fungus .
oh , that is very unusual .
i think it is the food of the future .
egon , there s something very strange about that man . i am very psychic usually and right now i have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you . i am afraid you are going to die .
die in what sense ?
in the physical sense .
i do not care . i see us as tiny parts of a vast organism , like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void .
i want you to have this .
what is it ?
it is a souvenir from the world s fair at flushing meadow . it is my lucky coin .
i do not believe in luck .
keep it anyway . i have another one at home .
why do not you step into the office and we will talk about it . hold all my calls , janine .
here s the paper on the brooklyn job . she paid with a visa card .
and someone from the epa is here to see you .
the epa ? that is he want ?
i did not ask him . all i know is that i have not had a break in two weeks and you promised you would hire more help .
janine , i am sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry .
thank you for coming so quickly . the guests are starting to ask questions and i am running out of excuses .
has this ever happened before ?
well , most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor . . . the disturbances , i mean . . . but it is been quiet for years . . . up until two weeks ago . . . it was never ever this bad , though .
did you ever report it to anyone ?
heavens , no ! the owners do not like us to even talk about it . i hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight .
can i help you ?
i am walter peck . i represent the environmental protection agency , third district .
great ! how is it going ?
are you peter venkman ?
exactly what are you a doctor of , mr . venkman ?
i have ph . d s in psychology and parapsychology .
i see . and now you catch ghosts ?
you could say that .
and how many ghosts have you caught , mr . venkman ?
i am not at liberty to say .
and where do you put these ghosts once you catch them ?
in a storage facility .
and would this storage facility be located on these premises ?
yes , it would .
and may i see this storage facility ?
no , you may not .
and why not , mr . venkman ?
because you did not say the magic word .
and what is the magic word , mr . venkman ?
may i please see the storage facility ?
why do you want to see it ?
well , because i am curious . i want to know more about what you do here . frankly , there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation . for instance , the storage of noxious , possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement . now either you show me that is down there or i come back with a court order .
go ahead ! get a court order . then i am gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution .
have it your way , mr . venkman .
at ease , officers . i am peter venkman . i think there s been some kind of misunderstanding here and i want to cooperate in every way i can .
you turned off the power ! look , there was another man here . . . you have to find him and bring him back . a short determined looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie .
the man is a psychopath , your honor .
mr . mayor , it is a pretty simple choice . you can believe mr . pecker here . . .
that is peck !
all right . what is it ?
a square ?
circle ?
nervous ?
yes . i do not like this .
well , just more to go . that is this one ?
two wavy lines ?
hey ! i am getting a little tired of this .
you volunteered , did not you ? are not we paying you for this ?
yeah , but i did not know you were going to give me electric shocks . what are you trying to prove ?
i am studying the effect of negative reinforcement on esp ability .
i will tell you the effect ! it pisses me off !
hey , mister ! can i see those guns ?
they are not guns . they are particle throwers .
yeah , yeah . i just want to see em .
wait ! wait ! let me ask you something . if you like shot superman with those guns , would he feel it or what ?
on earth no . but on krypton we could slice him up like oscar mayer bologna .
yes ?
were you recently in the bathroom ?
what on earth gave you that idea ?
the wet towels , residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair , the redness in your cheeks indicating . . .
you are a regular sherlock holmes . now what do you want ?
oh ! you are here .
what have you got , egon ?
oh , this is big , peter . this is very big . there s definitely something here .
spengler , are you serious about actually catching a ghost ?
i am always serious .
just for your information , ray , the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over , .
generally , you do not see that kind of behavior in a major appliance . what do you think , egon ?
did you see anything ?
something was definitely here .
wait ! wait ! there s something i forgot to tell you .
what ?
do not cross the beams .
why not ?
trust me . it will be bad .
what do you mean bad ?
it is peter , egon . i have got a problem .
what is it ?
i am with dana barrett and she is floating three feet off the bed .
does she want to be ?
i do not think so . it is more of that gozer thing . she says she is the gatekeeper . does that make any sense to you ?
some . i just met the keymaster . he is here with me now . venkman ? are you there ?
yeah , yeah . i was just thinking . it probably would not be a good idea for them to get together at this point .
i agree .
all right . i will try .
i will spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning .
he wants to shut down the storage grid .
where is the keymaster ?
of course ! ivo shandor , i saw his name in tobings spirit guide . he started a secret society in .
let me guess gozer worshippers .
yes . after the first world war shandor decided that society was too sick to survive . and he was not alone . he had close to a thousand followers when he died . they conducted rituals , bizarre rituals , intended to bring about the end of the world .
she said he was the destructor .
who ?
gozer .
you talked to gozer ?
what now ?
on the count of three ! one . . . two . . .
no ! you said crossing the beams would be bad . it will kill her ! and us !
life is just a state of mind .
you know , peter , this could be a past life experience intruding on the present .
i just realized something . we have never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment .
sorry , buddy !
ray ! where are you ? are you all right ?
it is working !
set entry grid .
i have got to sleep .
i need two new purge valves . how is the grid around the storage facility holding up ?
what happened ? ? ! ! ! ?
look at the structure of the roof cap . it looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker nasa uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies .
you mean if i stand here and concentrate on the image of roberto clemente , gozer will appear as roberto clemente and wipe us out ?
excuse me for a minute . ray , i am right in the middle of something here . can you come back in about an hour ?
peter , at this afternoon at the main branch of the new york public library on fifth avenue , ten people witnessed a free roaming , vaporous , full torso apparition . it blew books from shelves at twenty feet away . scared the socks off some poor librarian .
sure . that is great , ray . i think you should get down there right away and check it out . let me know what happens .
spengler and i have charted every psychic occurrence in the tri state area for the past two years . the graph we came up with definitely points to something big .
ray , as your friend i have to tell you i think you have really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff . you have been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the five boroughs who thinks he is had an experience . and what have you seen ?
what do you mean by seen ?
looked at with your eyes .
well , i was at an unexplained multiple high altitude rockfall once .
what is it ?
i told you it is real .
what do we do now ?
i do not know . talk to it .
what do i say ?
anything ! just make contact .
hey , lady ? lady ! can you talk ? who are you ? this is not working . think of something else .
get her ? that was your whole plan ? you call that science ?
i guess i got a little overexcited . was not it incredible ! i am telling you , this is a first . you know what this could mean to the university ?
if you guys are right , if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow , i think i could win the nobel prize .
if anyone deserves it , it is spengler and me . we are doing all the hard research and designing the equipment .
you said you floored em at the regents meeting .
this is like a major disgrace . forget m . i . t . or stanford now . . . they would not touch us with a three meter cattle prod .
you are always so worried about your reputation . we do not need the university . einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk . they cannot stop progress .
do you know what a patent clerk makes ? i liked the university . they gave us money , they gave us the facilities and we did not have to produce anything ! i have worked in the private sector . they expect results . you have never been out of college . you do not know what it is like out there .
let me tell you , ray , everything in life happens for a reason . call it fate , call it luck , karma , whatever . i think we were destined to get kicked out of there .
for what purpose ?
you will never regret this , ray .
my parents left me that house , i was born there .
you are not going to lose the house . everybody has three mortgages these days .
but most people are afraid to even report these things .
wow ! does this pole still work ?
everybody can relax . i found the car . how do you like it ?
do you think it is wide enough ? how much ?
why do not i check out the building ? it may have a history of psychic turbulence .
how was your date ?
they will .
so do i .
no sense worrying about it now .
i am getting high readings near the air vents . it must be using the duct system to get around . see , i told you we would get something .
so far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a puerto rican bellboy .
ray something s here .
where are you , pete ?
third floor . get down here ,
sit tight . i am on my way .
it is here , ray . it is looking at me .
do not move . it will not hurt you .
how do you know ?
boy , that was a rough one .
egon , how is the grid around the storage facility holding up ?
i guess they do not build them like they used to , huh ?
no ! nobody ever built them like this ! the architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius . the whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy .
who was the architect ?
it does not seem to have slowed him down any .
as a duly constituted representative of the city of new york , and on behalf of the county and state of new york , the united states of america , the planet earth and all its inhabitants , i hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension .
agile bastard , is not he ?
i could not help it ! it just popped in there !
what ? what popped in there ?
and you came up with that ?
the stay puft marshmallow man ! he was on all the packages we used to buy when i was a kid . we used to roast stay puft marshmallows at camp waconda !
very impressive resume . electronic countermeasures , strategic air command . . . black belt in karate . . . small arms expert . . . mr . zeddemore , as you may have heard , we locate ghosts and spirits , trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people s homes , offices and places of worship .
hey man . what is it you are so involved with there ?
uh . . . oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in dana barrett s apartment building . . . and they are most unusual .
are you a christian , ray ?
mmmhmmm .
me , too .
boy ! solid cores of shielded selenium . .
do you believe in god ?
no . but i liked jesus style .
me , too . parts of the bible are great .
the whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium tungsten alloy .
ray , do you remember something in the bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves ?
and the seas would boil . . .
right . and the sky would fall . . .
judgement day . . .
yeah , judgement day .
every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world .
you do not have to worry about that with us , sir .
stantz ? you okay in there ?
that is he talking about ? choose what ?
where are we now , commodus ? can you see the camp ? my gods ! the air is turning into ice !
we are nearly there , lucilla .
that is what you told me two days ago !
will you please get back in your wagon ? and stay there ?
more wine , sister ? surely you can drink more than that .
i was suddenly thinking about going to bed .
quite so . narcissus and his courageous men may they live long to serve rome . . .
do not you think you should at least wave ?
they hate me , they really hate me do not they ?
i should at least have you , do not you think ?
did narcissus die today ? was not this his day to die ?
no one in rome has ever heard of him . do you want to remind those few in the senate who have ? the whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with . forget about him .
those are priceless sculptures .
it is disgusting ! animals ! i had to come here under armed guard . slaves get this junk out of my sight .
how about in the forum . right in front of the senate .
if i may be so bold . . .
for the gods , spit it out !
kill him ! tribuus execute that bastard .
tribuus . . . tomorrow .
you are coming back ?
where have you been ?
taking my pleasure . do i need to clear my lovers with you ?
you must start clearing everything with me especially your lovers .
why are you so surly you have won , brother . the people have bread and the city is quiet .
what is that . . . wailing ?
now that is a happy sound ! tomorrow , i want the citizens my people back in the arena . the gods know , i am tired . come to bed , now tonight we are celebrating .
what are you talking about ?
now that we are done with that infatuation forever .
if i ever loved narcissus it was not like you want .
. . . encased in the armor of a demigod , narcissus the good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast . . .
yes ? go on !
tell lykas to send a retiarius and a samnite to help tiger .
you cannot do that . . . listen to the mood of the crowd .
i want that bastard dead !
you want control of the crowd you cannot get it by killing their hero .
i am their hero !
not yet , dear brother . . .
lykas , pick a man . someone who will look good . jerses i want it built up in the daily action . . .
damn him ! i should have killed him on the front i let you talk me out of that .
you would have had a full scale revolt on your hands .
welcome back from your great triumph narcissus meridas . my father sends his heart felt praise . sadly , marcus is in dark humors nothing to worry about , but he needs rest . likely just the weather .
respectfully caesar , quintus and i must report .
do you expect marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience ?
that is difficult to say , general .
then you would be out of a job .
gladly caesar .
i back rome against all her enemies if that answer disappoints you , i am not a politician . . .
i would say there s nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what right is .
but they are not destroyed , not yet .
you and my father have become very close . perhaps one day i may say the same for us .
you flatter me , caesar .
being as close , i am certain you have noticed what we all have noticed .
caesar ?
i am ordering a general stand down in preparation for withdrawal back across the danube .
forgive me , caesar , but do two senator represent the mood of the whole senate or the will of the roman people ? besides , every truce we make with the germans they break !
they will not break this one .
where is my family ?
cooperate and they will be returned to your estate . i could have executed you .
the army is a problem . they love you . you have led them from victory to victory in the name of rome and they love you . and after all , you are just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty who could fault you for that ? thus have i reached a compromise with the senate over your fate instead of executing you , i am sending you to rome where you will be tried . . .
endorse me in public . do that and i will make you rich and set you free . i will return your estates . i know you would give anything to be outside again . endorse me and you will be free . think of it . what would you do with your freedom ?
insubordination . to the emperor . . . and the senate .
the senate is out to sink you . i swear it , caesar , your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor . your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of janus when you must be confirmed the senate will be able to deny you .
caesar , ignore them .
ignore that ? ! the sooner we leave this disgusting place the better .
gods of hell ! this must cost a fortune ! how many days is this going to go on ?
and like children everywhere they scream freedom the most when they desire it least . i beg you , please continue , caesar .
throw it down into the streets ! down into the forum . if it is my father they want then give him to them !
yes . you know , that is not a bad idea .
maybe it will crush gaius .
i am serious .
so am i .
we can crush gaius another way . what if you do throw something to the people they really want ? make them a gift of food .
give away food ?
sacks of grain , even bread . i own the grain licenses for the military , i can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the danube .
take grain away from the army ?
caesar , let me sponsor your first wager in the arena .
gladly , caesar . and , if you would like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light .
marcus aurelius has died .
we must obey our emperor and the senate .
this is the only place in rome where i thought i believed i was wholly in power .
it is because he comes off as the underdog .
underdog ! how can he be an underdog he wins all the time ! i am the emperor why cannot i kill him ? he could be poisoned , or somehow killed to look like an accident .
where is my father ?
tribuus , what happened in the arena ? was narcissus killed ?
why is not he dead ? damn you , you promised me he would be dead !
yes , caesar ?
tribuus ! go left here , i want to see my new statue at via claudia .
yes , caesar .
you won an impossible fight . you got the attention of the crowd , legate . . .
this is cos , this precocious young man . a scribe for the daily action . i have invited him to write a small piece about you . . .
caesar commodus discovering his lineage converges with the demigod , hercules , has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens . the emperor s going to fight in the arena . i am supposed to write this for tomorrow s edition .
cos , what in hades is the emperor up to ? and do not tell me you do not know !
i do not know . . .
agh ! please ! he is having a secret device constructed for the circus . the brass craftsmen are working overtime .
i will nose around . . .
so tell me , what happened between you and the emperor ? what really happened on the german front ? you know the senate s arguing your case . . .
that is their job , is not it ? to argue . so , i think my case will be long on talk and short on action .
my birth sign is water bearer , twenty fifth day in the month of janus .
the emperor and i are bound by the threads of the fates . he was born on august thirty first , you know .
that makes his birth sign . . . virgo ! why that is the sign of a little girl ! can you tell my readers more about your star crossed connection with emperor commodus ?
it is time for you to tell the citizens that commodus stole the money allocated for defending the german border . it is time to tell the citizens everything . will you write it ?
the battle was won , today , and i prefer to believe it was a gift of janus , the eldest god of rome . god of my ancestors .
god of passages and changes ?
i believe we are arriving in an enlightened age an age of peace that will bring rome her greatest glory . thanks to marcus aurelius .
you know , general , there is a gate of janus in rome which is only closed in time of peace . sadly , it has remained open for three hundred years .
i have read of it .
but have never been ?
i would venture , with all respect the emperor s health is the business of every soul in the empire .
a republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes . at the core he is a man who believes in doing that is right .
the trouble is defining exactly what right is .
the senate too ?
the moment you returned from the battle your options were clear . if you are a friend to neither side , legate , you must be an enemy to both . we needed to know what you believed .
who are you ? narcissus the good ? i have heard of narcissus meridas . that is who i hear you are .
you are hearing about somebody else .
how did you get condemned to the arena without a trial ?
when the senate and the emperor agree miracles can happen .
would you support the senate if they would give you a trial ? you would have to give me your word .
i need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing ?
you are a citizen and a soldier . not a gladiator .
you on your way to trial , too , general ? or do you think they have already had our trial ?
why you ?
my loyalties . . . were in doubt .
fools to let us both live we will be our own best witnesses at our trial .
is this rome ? are we just going to be executed ?
no future telling , please , i have been terrified enough for one day .
you know our two most senior senators gaius cantus and falco verus ?
i thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities .
sneaking around with your brother ?
without him . he would be weeping if he overheard that . well ? the idea of you as my adopted brother is very . . . exciting .
i am not fit for the job and as a matter of fact i am not taking the job .
why do you keep playing at being so humble ? it is a little embarrassing .
why do you play at being drunk ?
how do you know i am playing ? well , the clown is always harmless . is not that right ? and how did you ever get to know me so well ? the last we spent any time together i was fourteen . i think you know me better than my father . he is going to die , is not he ?
i do not believe that . he is got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron . you know we are preparing for a full blown invasion of germany .
it is my brother s neck you want , not mine .
i came here to see that you stay alive . the people need a living breathing alternative to commodus , a hero .
you mean a symbol of someone who does not exist .
twenty years i have led men to die . for me it was the glory of rome . but that was something . if it was not that , then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore but that was something ! these men here are butchered for laughs ! their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line !
to think i brought my daughters up on all things roman . read to sleep on catullus , lucretius . . . virgil . . . every night . my beautiful daughters .
if you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic , then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men , just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads . but . . .
you cannot die .
would that marcus had lived .
marcus would have lived but . . . was poisoned by his son .
he killed his father and then my family . . .
where are they ?
commodus , it is we who are going on the offensive .
the fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they are most vulnerable .
i want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign .
i will , marcus . but you are going to be well enough to direct it yourself .
i have made so many mistakes , narcissus . we all put off the very last duties of our lives because we are afraid of admitting when our lives are over .
there s no reason to say that . everyone knows you are going to be well . i had servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light .
servis made it through again ?
if i would ever had a sign that you wanted to rule i would have . . . no , again , it is my own bullheadedness . narcissus , i should have adopted you years ago . and now the gods are begging me to make you my son !
commodus is just a young man , he will learn what you had to learn .
it is not because he is young , it is because he is ignorant and arrogant . his sister is a better man . that is why i have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the senate .
so i understand .
everyone talking about it ? i would not wonder . all i seek is a genuine balance of power between the emperor and the senate . thus i have transferred legal power which was theirs to begin with back to the senators . this includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan . it is a start , only a start . if the emperor and the senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share . this means commodus has to bend does he strike you as that type ?
you are too hard on him . he is a strong young man , with you as his guide . . .
a man should be upright , not be kept upright . history shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute . i want you to consider becoming my heir .
marcus , you honor me , but i am a soldier , politics scare the hell out of me .
the senators admire you .
they fear me .
they fear change . the new caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible . you could be the one , the emperor , the man who oversees the rebirth of the republic .
i made the plume from a quail feather .
do not stop to visit take the children straight home and i will follow as soon as i can .
tomorrow ?
as soon as i can .
on your honor as a roman officer , daddy ?
i see the emperor s little boy has finally caught up with the army .
what the hell was all that about ?
what the hell do you think it was about ? there s nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others .
why do not we try to keep politics out of the conversation .
serious stuff . . .
everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal .
what deal ?
rome is going to pay tribute like a defeated nation begging for mercy ? have you told your troops that ?
my troops do not make policy .
on his death bed i promised marcus i would complete our work here . the senate may be vacillating , but i have the army behind me . i am taking half a cohort and restocking that fort .
you brought the army into rome .
i was summoned .
it is your job as a roman officer to disobey such a summons .
it is my job to keep my job . and that , by the way , is now head of praetorian guard . good ole tribuus has been retired .
quintus , you have got at least a division with you we could take rome away from commodus and give it back to the senate !
you seem to be doing a great job of it single hand ! narcissus , the republic is dead . you think those senators could govern ? for the last hundred and fifty years they have worked hard at kissing an endless succession of imperial asses !
then give the empire back to the people . . . the children who will grow up to become senators . . .
what are you fighting for in here ? the good of rome ? i can end this madness now ! take the job for the sake of the gods , live !
he is very realistic .
well , you wanted the girls to have the best teachers .
greeks ?
what about their philosophy lessons ?
they are studying with cynics .
you need to come home !
i can see that . . .
the battle is over . the war is over . you have won !
this is our oil from our estates ?
very fancy . did you design the bottle ?
who else ? i am the one who runs the estates while you are here risking everything we have for the glory of rome ! or for the glory of you !
i am a soldier we are at war . i cannot stay home tending the damned olive groves ?
i want to come home , of course i do , i would have to be mad not to want that . it is just that marcus trusts me .
let him trust quintus .
quintus is overly idealistic .
i never knew a more idealistic man than you .
me ? well , i believe in rome . . . you would have to after what i have seen , how people outside the empire treat each other .
i do not even want to imagine the things you have seen . . .
when you get to ostia , use this bribe passage to africa or spain . save my family . you should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to egypt then to numidia .
you are not going ! you have to stay with us !
how long do you think commodus will let us live once he is in power ? a month ? half a year ? paestum will be a prison where he will hold us until it is time . . .
narcissus !
do you want to see themis and manto butchered ? if i die fighting commodus he will not care about you . if i live i will come and get you .
i will never die . you tell the girls that . you honor our ancestors and i will be there . every night . at the table of life .
your daughters need more than some vapors they need you !
they will have me . teach them . do not let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history , without philosophy , without meaning . teach them of the greeks , the babylonians , the hebrews , the numidians , the egyptians and the great romans . teach them , who we are !
you teach them !
you are a legate in the roman army . huh . . . ? and you act like one . what was your crime ?
i killed too many barbarians .
who the hell are you ?
i am the man who might save your life give you a bit more life at any rate . i am proximo palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me . i own this school and everything that is in it . you are in it ! but why ? what did a roman general do to get himself condemned to the colosseum ? understand , we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets . please , i separated you from the others because . . . . . . my nose tells me you have been condemned for important reasons .
condemned ? are not i owed a trial before being condemned ?
general , all i know is you have been condemned to the colosseum , and a trial is nowhere to be seen .
thank you . what is going to happen tomorrow ? exactly ?
you are to be killed , exactly . they will give you a sporting chance , but just enough to make your murder . . . entertaining . romans like to mix their metaphors laughter with their executions , you know ? if you survive , though , you will become a gladiator . a gladiator at least gets a fair fight .
death is a very light thing for you .
take your hands off me animal !
sorry but i have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise i will not even get back the cost of the bribe i had to pay the arena slaves to get you here . i know what you are trying to do kill yourself and trust in the roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands . the only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you are a very important individual . you make me feel good about my investment ! and that puking pig jerses he will not even discuss you . both of you have clamped mouths ! but i love all my fighters i will find out about your family . and about you . that i promise .
i refuse to be your slave . i refuse
legate narcissus meridas , general of the spanish felix legions ! i am proud to have you in my school ! now , show them what you can do !
i am not a gladiator . i refuse to fight .
general , do you realize what happened out there today ?
i did not get killed and everyone else did .
at the end of the day i was approached by the golden pompeii olive oil company . small , but profitable . they asked if you would endorse their oil . we could get some very nice posters . make some very big money . . .
what would the poster say narcissus would kill for a taste of golden pompeii olive oil ?
general , hang on . . . drink slowly . you are blessed by the gods to have a physician and a divine of janus with you tonight . a fan sent them to you .
proximo , if this is her doctor he is an assassin .
it will be good luck for you to wear that helmet . . . it belonged to cimon of smyrna . . . he was crushed by an elephant .
no more bad luck now ! the people are anticipating you ! i have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior the true roman ! the man who fought side by side with the wolf of rome !
tiger s challenged you and jerses has made me an offer , made us both an offer you take a fall .
you put this inside your shirt when tiger stabs your stomach it is full of pig s blood . gushes out everywhere ! it is really impressive . fantastic ! better than the real thing !
so i pretend i am dead . you get gold , what do i get ?
you get to come alive again in the country !
as , what , the galloping gladiator ? !
the point is you get to fight the easy country circuit , the small arenas , relax , live the good life !
spend my days beheading country bumpkins ? i do not know , proximo , who has better wine than you ? besides , i am beginning to think of the colosseum as my home .
but you have to go out there ! i will give you more than your one third ! when i get paid . . . just take the fall ! you are too hurt to fight and the mangs a killer !
pressures on , eh proximo ? there s got to be a load of money in this . why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window ?
tell me honestly , since this may be our last earthly meeting if this were a fair fight where would you put your money ?
on you ! of course ! you are my bravest fighter the best fighter i have ever seen !
such nobility from such an ignoble mouth . take my advice and make that bet .
how much money is involved ?
a great deal . they designed and build tiger s chariot . . .
they want to dump tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot , right ? they do not waste time . . .
i can really rape them on this ! can i at least tell them you will think about it ?
no . tell them i will do it . but i want more posters all over rome .
fantastic ! wonderful ! but posters are very expensive .
then get a large cash advance .
right , right . . . but they will have to bring in a lawyer . i do not want to get sued over this .
before they leave , get gold .
right , right , what am i thinking of ?
i want another interview with cos . tell him to bring plenty of ink .
so , things change . the government has moved to the circus . you are going to fight last . and commodus is going to fight first .
you were a soldier , and then a gladiator , were not you ?
let s talk about this later . right now we have other things to settle . you and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to ostia . from there , caesar has decreed you be given an estate in paestum . it is beautiful an old greek town right on the ocean . rich soil . perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements . . . although caesar will give you a sort of pension it is always good to look to the future , keep your hand in the arena . . . so to speak .
i want nothing to do with the arena .
commodus must hate you . free your gladiators and come with us .
hello .
you are living at home now . is that right ?
yes .
do you know what you are going to do ?
no .
are you going to graduate school ?
do you always drive like this ?

but could you try ?
i have had this feeling ever since i have graduated this kind of compulsion that i have to be rude all the time . do you know what i mean ?

no , i mean i would not want to wake anyone up .
we will not . let s go inside .

then you took her upstairs and you raped her .
please let me go .

no .
thank you .
will you come in , please ?
what ?
i want you to come in till i get the lights on .

but it is light in there now .

benjamin i am sorry to be this way , but i do not want to be alone in this house .
why not ?
please wait till my husband gets home .
when is he coming back ?

are you always this much afraid of being alone ?
yes .
well , why cannot you just lock the doors and go to bed ?
what do you think of me ?

you have known me nearly all of your life . you must have formed some opinion .
well i have always thought that you were a very nice person .
did you know i was an alcoholic ?
what ?
did you know that ?
look i think i should be going

oh no , mrs . robinson , oh no .

mrs . robinson , you did not i mean you did not expect

like what ?
what do you think ?
well i do not know .
for god s sake , mrs . robinson , here we are , you have got me into your house . you give me a drink . you put on music , now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband will not be home for hours .
so ?
are not you ?
why no . i had not thought of it . i feel rather flattered that you
mrs . robinson , will you forgive me for what i just said ?

it is not all right , it is the worst thing i have ever said to anyone .
sit down .
please forgive me . because i like you . i do not think of you that way . but i am mixed up .
all right . now finish your drink .
mrs . robinson , it makes me sick that i said that to you .

i know that . but i am
thank you .
what are you so scared of ?
i am not scared , mrs . robinson .
then why do you keep running away ?
have not you ever seen anybody in a slip before ?
but i just look what if mr . robinson walked in right now ?
what if he did ?
well , it would look pretty funny , would not it ?
do not you think he trusts us together ?
of course he does . but he might get the wrong idea . anyone might .
i do not see why . i am twice as old as you are . how could anyone think
but they would ! do not you see ?
benjamin i am not trying to seduce you . i wish you would
i know that . but please , mrs . robinson . this is difficult for me .
why is it ?
because i am confused about things . i cannot tell what i am imagining . i cannot tell that is real . i cannot

well do you want to go up first ?
yes i think that would be good .
i will be up in five minutes .
well goodbye then
benjamin .
yes ?
is not there something you want to tell me ?
to tell you ?
yes .
well i want you to know how much i appreciate this really

oh ? you are absolutely right . absolutely . it is .
thank you .
well .
benjamin .
yes ?
i will get undressed now . is that all right ?
sure . shall i i mean shall i just stand here ? i mean i do not know what you want me to do .
why do not you watch ?
will you bring me a hanger ?
what ?
oh yes . wood ?
what ?
wood or wire ? they have both .
either one will be fine .
thank you .
would this be easier for you in the dark ?
mrs . robinson i cannot do this .
you what ?
this is all terribly wrong .
benjamin do you find me undesirable ?
oh no , mrs . robinson . i think i think you are the most attractive of all my parents friends . i just do not think we could possibly
are you afraid of me ?
no but look maybe we could do something else together , mrs . robinson would you like to go to a movie .
benjamin , is this your first time ?
is this what ?
it is , is not it ? it is your first time .
that is a laugh , mrs . robinson . that is really a laugh . ha ha .
you can admit that , cannot you ?
are you kidding ?
it is nothing to be ashamed of
wait a minute !
on your first time
who said it was my first time ?
that you are afraid
wait a minute .
of bring inadequate i mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way
now do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time ?
if you want .
good . i mean are we dead or something ?
well i just do not think we have much to say to each other .
all we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together .
are you tired of it ?
i am not . no . but do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then ?
well what do you want to talk about ?
anything . anything at all .
do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences ?
oh my god .
well ?
leave it on ! now we are going to do this thing . we are going to have a conversation . think of another topic .
how about art .
art . that is a good subject . you start it off .
you start it off . i do not know anything about it .
oh .
do not you ?
yes i do . i know quite a bit about it .
go ahead then .
are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art .
neither .
you are not interested in art ?
no .
then why do you want to talk about it ?
can i take off my clothes now ?
no . think of another topic . tell me what you did today .
do you really want me to ?
yes i do .
do you want to hear it or not ?
yes . but you might try and spice it up with a little originality .
i got up . i ate breakfast and went shopping . during the afternoon i read a novel .
what one .
what ?
what novel did you read .
then i fixed supper for my husband and waited until
there !
what ?
your husband ! mrs . robinson ! there s something we could have a conversation about .
him ?
i mean everything . i do not know anything about how you how you work this . i do not know how you get out of the house at night . i do not know the risk involved .
there is not any .
how do you get out of the house ?
i walk out .
what do you say to him ?
he is asleep .
always ?
benjamin , this is not a very interesting topic .
please . now tell me . how do you know he will not wake up sometime and follow you .
because he takes sleeping pills . he takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o clock .
but what about the noise from the car . what if
the driveway s on my side of the house .
we are talking .
what ?
we are talking , mrs . robinson . we are talking .
calm down , benjamin .
now let s keep going here .
can i undress and talk at the same time ?
right .
thank you .
now . you say the driveway s on your side of the house . so i guess you do not sleep in the same room .
we do not .
so you do not i mean i do not like to seem like i am prying but i guess you do not sleep together or anything .
no we do not .
well how long has this been going on .
about five years .
oh no . are you kidding me ?
no .
you have not slept with your husband for five years ?
now and then . he gets drunk a few times a year .
how many times a year .
on new year s eve . sometimes on his birthday .
man , is this interesting .
is it ?
so you do not love him . you would not say you
we have talked enough , benjamin .
wait a minute . so you would not say you loved him .
not exactly .
but you do not hate him .
no , benjamin . i do not hate him . unhook my blouse .
well how do you feel about him , then ?
i do not .
well that is kind of a bad situation then , is not it ?
is it ?
well you loved him once , i assume . when you first knew him .
no .
what ?
i never did , benjamin . now let s
why did you do that ?
see if you can guess .
well i cannot .
think real hard , benjamin .
i cannot see why you did , unless . . . you did not have to marry him or anything , did you ?
do not tell elaine .
oh no . you had to marry him because you got pregnant ?
are you shocked ?
well i never thought of you and mr . robinson as the kind of people who . . .
all right . now let s get to bed .
wait a minute . wait a minute . so how did it happen ?
what ?
i mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances ?
not particularly .
and you were a student also .
yes .
at college .
yes .
what was your major ?
why are you asking me all this ?
because i am interested , mrs . robinson . now what was your major subject at college ?
art .
but i thought you i guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then .
kind of .
well how did it happen ?
how do you think .
i mean did he take you up to his room with him ? did you go to a hotel ?
benjamin , what does it possibly matter ?
i am curious .
we would go to his car .
oh no . in the car you did it ?
what kind of car was it ?
what ?
do you remember the make of the car ?
oh my god .
really . i want to know .
it was a ford , benjamin .
a ford ! a ford ! goddamnit , a ford ! that is great !
that is enough .
do not talk about elaine .
do not talk about elaine ?
no .
why not ?
i wish you would tell me .
there s nothing to tell .
well i guess i will have to ask her out on a date and find out that is
do you understand that ?
well look . i have no intention of taking her out .
good .
i was just kidding around .
good .
but why should not i ?
i have my reasons .
then let s hear them .
no .
i am not good enough for her to associate with , am i ? i am not good enough to even talk about her , am i ?
let s drop it .
we are not dropping it . now that is the reason , is not it ? i am a dirty degenerate , are not i ? i am not fit to
benjamin ?
i am good enough for you but i am too slimy to associate with your daughter . that is it , is not it ? is not it ?
yes .
you go to hell . you go straight to hell , mrs . robinson . do you think i am proud of myself ? do you think i am proud of this ?
i would not know .
well , i am not .
you are not .
no sir . i am not proud that i spend my time with a broken down alcoholic !
i see .
because mrs . robinson this is the sickest , most perverted thing that ever happened to me . and you do what you want but i am getting the hell out .
are you ?
that i am a sick and disgusting person .
now do not start this .
what ?
do not start acting hurt .
do not you expect me to be a little hurt ?
mrs . robinson , you stand there and tell me i am not good enough for your daughter .
did i say that ?
benjamin , i want to apologize to you if that is the impression you got .
well two minutes ago you told me i was not good enough for your daughter . now you say you are sorry i got that impression .
i did not mean it . i do not think you would be right for each other . but i would never say you were not as good a person as she is .
you would not .
what are you doing ?
well it is pretty obvious you do not want me around any more .
well look i was kind of upset there . i am sorry i said those things .
if that is how you feel
but it is not .
that is all right . i think i can understand why i am disgusting to you .
oh no . look i like you . i would not keep coming here if i did not like you .
but if it is sickening for you
it is not ! i enjoy it ! i look forward to it . it is the one thing i have to look forward to .
you do not have to say that .
well i would not . i would never say it if it was not true .
may i stay then ?
yes . please . i want you to .
thank you .
look . why the hell did you bring this up . it never occurred to me to take her out .
then give me your word you will not .
this is absurd .
promise me , benjamin .
all right , for christ s sake . i promise i will never take out elaine robinson .
thank you . benjamin
now listen this was not my idea . it was my father s idea .
benjamin i thought i made myself perfectly clear about this .
look , we will go out to dinner and have a drink and i will bring her back . because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families . and i am afraid i could not quite handle that , if you do not mind . i have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life . so do not get upset about it .
drive down the block .
mrs . robinson i have a date with elaine . we are going for a drive .
now it seems to me
mrs . robinson
i can makes things quite unpleasant .
how ?
in order to keep elaine away from you i am prepared to tell her everything .
i do not believe you .
then you would better start believing me .
mrs . robinson , do not wreck it . i am asking you please not to wreck it .
go home now .
hello . get me the police , please .
where is elaine ?
what have you done to her ?
you cannot stop me from seeing her , mrs . robinson . i will find her .
i am sorry we will not be able to invite you to the wedding , benjamin , but the arrangements have been so rushed
ahh . i do not think you will have time for that drink after all .
i will find her .
i say i have got it .
sir ?
the toothbrush . i got it all right .
very good , sir .
yes . well goodnight .
no actually i am not
braddock braddock ?
yes , but i am afraid
i will find your table in a moment . braddock . not braniff ? we have a braniff .
no actually i am just looking for a friend .
i am afraid i do not understand .
i am not with your party i am sorry .
say hello to mrs . robinson , benjamin .
can i talk to you a minute ?
sure .
benjamin ? i am going to ask you something but you do not have to tell me if you do not want .
what ?
well i am going to ask you what you do when you go off at night .
when i go off ?
you do not have to tell me if you do not want .
i drive around .
what else ?
nothing else .
well you do not drive around from midnight until noon the next day , benjamin .
oh , no .
then what do you do ? do you meet someone ?
why did you say that ?
well this is your business , benjamin . if you
i do not meet anyone , mother , but why did you say that ?
benjamin , i am not going to pry into your affairs , but i would rather you did not say anything at all than be dishonest . goodnight , benjamin .
well why do you why do you think that ?
because i know you do not drive around for twelve hours .
oh . well , i do not . shall i tell you what i do ?
not if you do not want to .
i do .
but i do not want you to make up something .
i am not . but i am i am not very proud of what i do . i usually get kind of drunk . i usually drive over to los angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk . then i take a hotel room . so i will not have to drive home on the freeway . i mean it kind of scares me to drive home after
goodnight , benjamin .
you believe me , do not you ?
no .
but i want you to . please . please will you believe me .
it is pretty embarrassing . i really do not know what to tell mr . robinson . it is awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up elaine .
do not go on like this . now if benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out
i do .
i am going up to berkeley today .
they do not know ?
no they do not .
well when did you decide all this ?
when did you two talk this over ?
i am just
worried ?
well
about what ?
i guess about my future .
what about it ?
i do not know . i want it to be
to be what ?
why ?
well it is very comfortable just to drift here .
have you thought about graduate school ?
no .
would you mind telling me then what were those four years of college for ? what was the point of all that hard work ?
you got me .
i guess she is not good enough for you , is that it ?
look elaine robinson and i do not get along .
how do you know ? you have not seen her since high school . i guess your evenings , whatever you do with them , are just too valuable .
that has nothing to do with it
say that again .
come on , let s call the robinsons . we have got something to celebrate .
wait a minute . you talked to elaine this morning ?
no . she does not know about it .
she does not know that you are coming up to berkeley ?
ben this whole idea sounds pretty half baked .
i drove i drove mrs . robinson home . she wanted me to drive her home so i i drove her home .
swell . i appreciate it .
she is upstairs . she wanted me to wait down here till you got home .
standing guard over the old castle , are you ?
here . it looks like you need a refill .
oh no .
what ?
i have got to go .
is anything wrong ? you look a little shaken up .
thank you very much , sir .
ben how old are you now ?
twenty . i will be twenty one next week .
that is a hell of a good age to be .
thank you .
i wish i was that age again . because , ben
sir ?
you will never be young again .
i know .
ben , can i say something to you ?
what ?
how long have you and i known each other ? how long have your dad and i been partners ?
quite a while .
i have watched you grow up , ben .
yes , sir .
in many ways i feel as though you were my own son .
thank you .
so i hope you will not mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice .
i would like to hear it .
you have yourself a few flings this summer . i bet you are quite a ladies man .
oh no .
oh say elaine gets down from berkeley on saturday .
oh yes .
ben i want you to give her a call .
i will .
hi , ben . what are you doing with yourself these days ?
oh not too much . taking it easy .
that is what i would do if i could . nothing wrong with that . hey ben , elaine s coming down from berkeley soon . i want you to call her up this time .
i will .
hello .
what would you say to a short one ? bourbon still your drink ?
do you want do you want to try and tell me why you did it ?
mr . robinson ?
do you have a special grudge against me ? do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me ?
no , it is not
is there something i have said that is caused this contempt ? or is it just the things i stand for that you despise ?
it was nothing to do with you , sir .
now look please
ben , i think we are two civilized human beings . do you think it is necessary to threaten each other ?
i am not threatening you .
do you want to unclench your fists , please ? thank you . i can see in the dark , you know . i have been here quite a while .
i am trying to tell you i have no personal feelings about you , mr . robinson . i am trying to tell you i do not resent you .
you do not respect me terribly much either , do you ?
no , i do not .
well , i do not think we have a whole lot to say to each other , ben . i do think you should know the consequences of what you have done . i do think you should know that my wife and i are getting a divorce soon .
but why ?
why ?
it should not make any difference what happened .
that is quite a statement .
listen to me . we got we got into bed with each other . but it was nothing . it was nothing at all . we might we might just as well have been shaking hands .
shaking hands . well , that is not saying much for my wife , is it ?
you miss the point .
do not shout at me , ben .
the point is i do not love your wife . i love your daughter , sir .
well i am sure you think you do , ben , but after a few times in bed with elaine i feel quite sure you would get over that as quickly as you
huh ?
hello .
mrs . robinson ?
yes ?
it is benjamin .
yes ?
benjamin braddock .
benjamin where are you ?
can you see me now ?
are you ready in there , feature attraction ?
dad could we just talk about this for a second ?
i cannot hold them much longer , ben . you better get out here .
i would like to discuss this .
before he does you are disappointing them , ben . you are disappointing them .
dad can you listen
is anything wrong ?
the carlsons are here .
they came all the way from tarzana .
that is happening ?
ben says he and elaine are getting married .
i do not believe it .
turn em up .
i am having luck for the first time in my life .
i ought not to presume , but i i am so grateful to you it is been so marvelous . the first time in my life i have gambled i have danced ! oh , you can laugh , gentlemen , but it is the first time in my life i have ever tasted life !
life , gentlemen , is wonderful , but very dangerous . you must have courage for it , then it is wonderful . you gentlemen do not know that because you are all healthy and happy , but i believe me a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life .
it is a short life and a gay one . . .
have you a minute now ?
no i told you not to come in this lobby .
time s getting short .
i want to speak
not now .
you are late the dancer s gone to the theatre .
well ?
she is gone to the theatre do not you know ?
yes .
and what are you going to do ?
the pearls are in her room .
now listen to me . the others are getting suspicious of you . i was on the telephone to amsterdam today , they think you are scared .
i have been careful , i have been waiting my chance .
you have been waiting your chance . you are too much of a gentleman that is the trouble with you .
i told you i will get the pearls tonight .
need any help ?
no .
no
why ?
the floor clerk is out there in the corridor she sees everything
i could take care of her .
how ?
chloroform on a handkerchief from behind while you . . .
no no no no . . .
why ?
poor girl chloroform would give her a rotten headache . . . i know i had it in the war . besides , she is very pretty not young but
you are no good for this business . it is just a joke to you . . .
i do not like your tone .
get out and leave it to me . . . be ready to leave on the night train for amsterdam . . .
with the pearls ?
i have quit .
you cannot .
i am not going to get those pearls and neither are you .
what about the money ?
i will pay you back .
how ?
i have an idea working in my head . . .
you might find a bullet through that head . . .
like dancing ?
never ?
you are a fool !
he must be very nice .
who ?
whoever is keeping you waiting .
have you seen it ?
oh , my large and noisy neighbor really ? that ?
that .
you ?
oh work ! !
oh !
dictation . you know . . .
oh . . . poor child . if you were free , i would ask you to come and have some tea but
tea would spoil my dinner . one meal a day , i would hate to spoil it .
reducing ?
no why ? should i ?
lord no charming but why one meal a day ?
money ever heard of it ?
yes yes indeed but you are a . . . . . . a stenographer . do not little stenographers earn little pennies ?
very little .
too bad .
did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on ? one that she would bought herself ?
poor child i wish i were free tonight we could

what ?

unfortunately no to bad tomorrow though .
tomorrow ? what time tomorrow ?
shall we say five o clock downstairs ?
where downstairs ?
yellow room where they dance
you are very funny
yes ? tomorrow ?
of course .
we will dance .
i would given you up .
chasing around .
chasing what ?
you were very different yesterday .
that was lovely .
will you do me a big favor ?
i will do anything for you .
would you like to make a man happy ?
yes i would love to .
then dance the next number with kringelein .
why ?
i feel sorry for him .
you are not a bit like you were yesterday .
i fell in love last night the real thing .
oh there s no real thing it does not exist .
i thought that , too but i found that it does . come along , dance with kringelein .
going ?
flaemmchen , what are you doing here in the middle of the night .
looking for my room one sixty six .
you live here ?
for tonight .
oh !
yes oh !
well such is life , flaemmchen .
please do not be frightened , madam .
what do you want here ?
nothing only to be here .
why do you hide in my room ?
but surely you must know because i love you .
poor little grusinskaya ! does it do you good to cry ? are you afraid ? shall i go ?
i was so alone always alone and suddenly you were there and said that . no . i am not afraid . it is strange .
do not cry it tears my heart to see you sob like that .
nerves just nerves . you must forgive me . i have had a bad evening . i am very tired . do you know what it is to be tired tired of a routine existence ?
so you feel like coming into a lady s room and you come . . . what now ?
i would like to smoke a cigarette .
why do you look at me like that ?
i did not know you were so beautiful . . . and
and then ?
no irony . you are so appealing so soft so tired . i feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you ever .
and and
how tired you are !
yes tired . . .
so alone .
alone . all alone . oh , you strange strange creature .
you must not talk russian to me .
strange man . . .
am i quite strange to you ?
not quite strange now . it is as if i had been expecting you . you know , once when the grand duke was alive , i found a man hiding in my room a young officer
and . . . ?
he disappeared . later he was found dead .
i never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a womangs room when she is alone .
go away . who are you ?
a man who could love that is all , who has forgotten everything else for you .
you could love me . it is so long since i have heard that word . nobody has loved me for a long time . it is so icy cold to be famous . one is so cruelly alone . how is it that you let me look at you . your hands . your eyes . why could you love me ?
i saw you just now then i saw you cry and now i see you in the mirror grusinskaya . . .
grusinskaya . . . oh oh if you knew how i slaved and slaved for grusinskaya for the success of grusinskaya for the triumph of grusinskaya . . . and what is she now ? just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases are you listening to me do you understand ? i want you to understand .
yes i do understand .
i think you must go now the key is on the floor .
i am not going you know i am not going let me stay here ?
i want to be alone .
that is not so you do not want to be alone .
i want to be alone
no you do not want to be alone at all you were in despair before if i left you , you would feel worse than you did before , you must not be alone you must not cry you must forget . . . tell me that i can stay with you tell me .
the stage frays one s nerves . . . the discipline it is so exacting . discipline means doing what you do not want to do and take no pleasure in doing . do you know what i mean ? have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline ?
i see you do only what you take pleasure in doing . you take pleasure in coming into a womangs bedroom and you come . you take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony , so you do it . . . and what is your pleasure now ?
why do you smile ?
because i can see something in the mirror that you cannot . my dear
what can you see ?
you are beautiful !
no .
i am not going . . . you know that i am not going . . . do you think i could leave you alone here ? after that ?
what ?
the veronal you . i am going to stay here with you .
i want to be alone .
oh i was ambitious then ambition was in my blood no rest , no stopping . we were drilled like little soldiers we danced in the school of the imperial ballet , in st . petersburg . i was little and slim but hard as diamond a duty machine no rest , no stopping . and then i became famous and whoever is famous is alone . . . but why should i be telling you this ? last night i did not know you at all who are you , really ? i do not even know your name .
i am felix benvenuto von gaigern . my mother called me flix .
flix . and how do you live ? what kind of a person are you ?
i am a prodigal son , the black sheep of a white flock i shall die on the gallows .
really ?
really , i have not a bit of character . none at all .
no ?
when i was a little boy i was taught to ride and be a gentleman at school , it was a monastery , i learned to pray and lie and
and ?
and then , in the war , to kill and hide . that is all .
and what do you do now ?
i am a gambler i am running at large like a happy pig , devouring anything of life that pleases me , i really belong in jail
oh ! what a picture and what else ?
i am also a criminal and a hotel thief .
that is a silly joke .
please look at me . you must believe me you must believe that i love you that i have never known what love is until last night .
there .
you may keep the pearls i do not want them any more i will make you a present of them .
i do not want them now .
i will not denounce you .
i know .
so
yesterday i was a thief but now ,
but now , you must go . . . i give you the pearls . but now you must go
i wanted money desperately can you understand ? that is why i wanted the pearls . i was threatened i was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money . i have been following you i have admired you . but i have forced myself not to think about you last night , at last , i managed to came into your room and and now .
and now ?
do you understand ?
grusinskaya
yes .
you do believe that i really love you ?

certainly always when grusinskaya dances .
well last night was not so good .
i thought she was splendid !
it is always so quiet here .
if you occupied the room next to madam grusinskaya , you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby .
my dear sir , i would gladly change rooms with you .
the war .
that is doctor otternschlag you know him ?
yes he always seems to be waiting for something and nothing ever comes .
the war dropped him here and forgot him .
perhaps you could present me now , mr . pimenov .
pardon me , the lady has urgent business here with me .
oh , let the poor devil alone .
i think it would be much better if you went away .
we shall see who remains here the longer .
aha ! the baron . what do you want here ?
i must have made a mistake .
so that is how we stand , baron .
look here , sir i am completely at your mercy i am desperate it is a matter of life or death i had to get some money tonight .
indeed you must , baron you must . humm humm , but you must go to jail , baron , you are a thief .

the big manufacturer killed baron von gaigern .

it seems that he was a thief and an imposter .
i do not believe it he was a real gentleman . i know people . . . i am so tired i can hardly see out of my eyes . no sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel that means a lot of work . but it is too bad about the baron , you always felt better when he came along always friendly such an agreeable fellow .

i came here from a long distance to stay at the grand hotel . i want a room a big room like you would give general director preysing i am as good as mr . preysing i can pay like mr . preysing would you give him a little room , way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going bang bang bang . . .
this gentleman can have my room .

what , doctor ?
a masculine paradise drink , the ladies , dancing . . .

you must learn as quickly as your time allows believe me mr . kringelein , a man who is not with a woman is a dead man .
have not you anyone have not you anybody you i mean are you all alone in the world .
i am always alone i have been everything .

there is no pocketbook here . . . on the floor probably .
more than fourteen thousand marks . . . were in that pocketbook .
oh , i have got to find it .
stay where you are .
you have nothing to fear , kringelein
if i could trouble the baron to come and see this beautiful room . i have ordered champagne . perhaps the baroness could join us .
waiter , oh waiter ! wait a minute ! we are having caviar it is expensive but that makes no difference i see the baroness is laughing .
you may laugh . caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you , but to me they mean a great deal . you see , i am ill and all of a sudden i got a fear of missing life . i do not want to miss life do you understand ?
you are funny . you speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch .
i am sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste distinctive , do not you think ? velvet upholstery a number one . i am in the textile trade and i know . and these are real silk drapes .
silk think of that silk they are , too .
her master s voice ! i must go now goodbye thanks .

oh i was thinking poor baron lying there , his eyes so open .
you loved the baron , did not you ?
yes
so did i . he was friendly to me as no man ever was .
perhaps he really was a burglar but they do not kill a man for that .
he was in desperate straits . he would been trying to raise money all day . he laughed poor devil ! and then a man like preysing kills him .
i did not like preysing right off .
then why did you have anything to do with him ?
money !
yes , of course , money !
you do not understand that do you ?
of course i do i never knew what money really meant till i started spending it . do you know i can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from preysing i will take care of you . will will you let me ?
what ?
you will have a good time with me . want to ? i have got enough money . ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook . three thousand four hundred that i won . it will last a long time . i can win more we will travel .

wherever you like . here i will give you the money i won , three thousand four hundred . later you can have more .
later ?
when i i am ill , flaemmchen it will not be long i will not last long . will you stay with me until . . .
nonsense ! we will find a great doctor , he will cure you . they can cure anything these days .

moreover . . .

no only occasional jobs .

moreover . . .

i could not do that , you are a stranger to me .
you are a funny little creature , flaemmchen . i cannot make you out .
and ask me what it is costing us to hammer it down .
exactly .
if the preysing people get the manchester contract , we shall certainly merge with the preysing company but if they have not they are ruined preysing will have to declare himself .
oh ho you want legal aid against us ? the whole thing seems to me to be very simple .
what we want to know about is manchester .
what ?
they turn out marvelous material in manchester .
there s a lot of business to be done with the manchester cotton company . they have the whole english market right in their hands . have you any connections with manchester ?
we have a good many connections in england , naturally .
i mean with the manchester people ?
we are here to discuss our merger . naturally i can make no statement at this time . we must begin at the beginning .
all right .
oh yes i beg your pardon !
i am laying before you the last general statement of our concern . active capital , plant and machinery , raw material and finished product for instance mop rags
i would like to wait for justice zinnowitz , before i commit myself .
oh preysing , preysing
no water what a place !
now to proceed with the projected merger , the advantages for the saxonia are so obvious . . .
oh now let s talk like adults . you want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do . we know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it would not sound so good . when you first approached us . . .
tentative my foot a month before this your old father in law came very privately and scratched at my door .
scratched we did not take the initiative .
i know you did i said you did
evil days i have shown you here my company exports to the balkans alone , sixty five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year .
mop rags mop rags we are interested in something quite different !
sorry , preysing .
you have decided against the merger ?
yes
then , it is all over ?
goodbye , preysing , i hope you pull through . this is a very bad time to be in such a crisis . we have . . .
why talk it is over it is over it is finished . you have broken off negotiations . you did it . you are calling them off . you had nothing on your mind all day , but manchester , manchester manchester . you do not suppose for one moment that i am such a fool as not to have something that i could say definitely about manchester .
what ?
oh no no the session is over . let s go , it is off . thank you , gentlemen .
if you actually have news from manchester then . . .
gentlemen , i am now free to announce . . . . . . that the deal between my firm and the manchester cotton company has been successfully negotiated .
i thought we would suspended negotiations , gentlemen .
under these circumstances it is quite a different matter .
see you soon , preysing . next week we will meet and discuss further details .
how clear is manchester ?
since , on the eleventh of june of this year when the first negotiations for a merger . . .
thank god we are beginning at the beginning .
as you remember it when you approached us . . .
. . . and let me say again for the tenth time . . . . . . you people were quite ready for the merger . you declared yourselves . . . fully agreed on all the terms why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up ?
mr . preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties . . .
here s my signature here preysing , sign here .

shall i tell them again ?
why waste time it is getting late .

wouldeal with manchester definitely off ! preysing , oh i would never have thought it of you .
no one would have thought it of me . i have been getting rusty in fredersdorf . well , if bluff is what the world wants i guess i can put up as big a bluff as anyone . from now on . . .
you must go to manchester at once yourself and really see it through .
yes i must go to england i was desperate now i do not care this sort of thing goes to a mangs head .
what you need is some relaxation .

zinnowitz , would you say she was pretty ?
pretty as a picture .
let s go down and find her i need a drink come along zinnowitz . i do not know anything about women been married for twenty six years .
hi , bobo .
well , i guess so . you are the guy i work for .
how would you figure you were gonna get away with that ?
i am not getting away with anything , bobo .
you are fuckin right you are not . how much did your pals cut you in for on that nag , huh ? or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me ?
one question . do you want to stick to that story , or do you want to keep your teeth ?
i want to keep my teeth .
now i will ask you another . you think i got no contacts out here ? that nag paid off at just the opening price . there was not hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted . there ai not enough action to tickle the tote , but you claim a ten grand win ! you send me ten thousand dollars , like i am some mark you can blow off !
bobo , no , i
you wanna talk to me straight up ?
my son
your what ?
my son was in the hospital
what the fuck are you doin with a son ?
he left home a long time ago . he was in the hospital , up in los ang gleez , real sick .
motherhood .
i never fucked up before , bobo .
i got a lot of people work for me , lilly . i cannot have shit like this .
it will never happen again . i swear .
you are calling the shots .
you got any kind of long coat in the car ? anything you can wear home over your clothes ?
no .
you ever hear about the oranges ?
you mean , the insurance frammis ?
you hit a person with the oranges in the towel , they get big , awful looking bruises , but they do not really get hurt , not if you do it right . it is for working scams against insurance companies .
and if you do it wrong ?
it can louse up your insides . you can get puh , puh , puh . . .
permanent damage .
almost forgot . that ten grand of yours . it is in the envelope by the door .
oh , thanks , bobo .
you want a drink ?
gee , i better not , if it is okay . i still gotta drive back up to los ang gleez .
he is a good kid . a salesman .
not skimming a thing , lilly ?
oh , well , you know . i just clip a buck here and a buck there . not enough to notice .
that is right . take a little , leave a little .
a person that do not look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else . he is a liability , right , bobo ?
you are a thousand percent right !
or else he is working an angle . if he does not steal a little , he is steeling big .
you know it , lilly .
you know , i like that suit , bobo . i do not know what there is about it , but it somehow makes you look taller .
yeah ? you really think so ? a lot of people been telling me the same thing .
well , you can tell them i said they are right . i better get going . roy will wonder where i am .
worries about his mother , eh ? give him a hug for me .
your kid s in the back here . he is crying .
roy ? he is always crying .
the kids beat him up , because his home life is , uh , different .
come on , kid , let s see if there s any food in the house .
evening . welcome to phoenix .
good evening . i would like a single for tonight .
i am a very light sleeper , traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night .
those trucks . i know exactly what you mean .
i will put you in one thirty one . very quiet . faces the desert .
sounds perfect . i can park my car back there ?
right in front of the room .
and i will want to leave an early wake up call .
mary beth , what we have here , uh . . .
oh , i told mister hebbing all about it , how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients !
mary beth , i hope you are not spreading this good news too widely .
well , i will have to take your word for it , mary beth . here s your money .
henry , next time , could not mister hebbing
mary beth ! this has never been anything but
well . if mary beth vouches for you , and if she told you the story already . . .
so here we are !
want a look ?
come take a look . an entire suite of main frame computer .
you ruined me ! you destroyed me !
cole , it will be all right . honey ?
cannot move .
it is just the strain again , the stress . we will take a vacation .
demon ! demon ! that is why you can walk on it ! demon !
well , that is what the law s for , is not it ?
and i do not just mean the sec . we could have the fbi breathing down our necks .
i certainly hope not .
loose talk is the one thing i worry about .
the tokyo exchange is nine hours ahead of us , new york one hour behind . there is not one hour of the day when both are open . information moves , but it has to wait . now , we have a young fellow working here do you know what a hacker is , mister hebbing ?
one of those computer geniuses , is not it ?
well , you have got your information ahead of new york , i see that .
every once in a while , a major change comes through . we have seven seconds to take advantage , put our buy order , our sell order , into the computer in new york before the tokyo data comes in .
not much time .
we have to be ready . we have to have the money , and we have to know what the information means , and we have to move immediately .
seven seconds . i do not see how you do it .
here you are ! two rich people !
i must admit , mister fellowes , i had moments i was worried .
the ambulance is on the way , for what good it will do .
what ? he is going to be all right !
mrs . dillon , your son was in some sort of accident . he is had an internal hemorrhage , he is bleeding to death inside .
well , make it stop !
his blood pressure is under a hundred . i do not think he will live to get to the hospital .
yes , yes , but that is
bobo wants you to go on to delmar .
delmar ? i never go out to california . that is a thousand miles from here .
nine hundred . bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time . come on , lilly , you do not argue with bobo .
i know .
take two , three days . call when you get there .
mrs . langtry , i am sorry .
why ? that is wrong ?
you are a valued customer , as you know .
but that is wrong ?
i cannot understand a thing like this . it is something you almost never see .
what is ?
this is some of the finest filigreed platinum i have ever seen . but the stones , no . they are not diamonds , mrs . langtry .
but they must be ! they cut glass !
it was a gift . it is not worth anything at all ?
all right .
i hope you are not too badly disappointed with us , mrs . langtry .
it is not your fault .
you will give us an opportunity to serve you again , i hope . if there s anything you think we might be interested in . . .
i have only one thing now . are you interested ?
well , i would have to see it , of course .
whadaya say ?
kaggs . home office .
roy dillon .
that is up ?
that was a pretty backhanded compliment . if i let people get away with things like that , i would not be a good salesman .
you are right . i apologize . but i still want to talk to you .
when i said you being the best salesman here did not say much , i meant for us . i know your record with sarber and webb , and i would say you are a top flight man , but you have had no incentive . no one walking on your heels . just a lot of half asses , so the tendency s been not to stretch yourself . i am bouncing the slobs , incidentally .
so i heard .
makes no difference to me if they are only on commission . if they do not make good money , they are not giving us good representation , and we cannot afford to have them around . ever supervise salesmen ?
just myself .
sounds like a good idea .
what ? me ?
that is just the first year . if you are not worth a lot more than that the second year , i will kick you out . what do you say ?
well , uh . . . no .
no ?
i cannot take that job ! i mean , i mean , i cannot take it right away . i am still recuperating , i just dropped in to say hello , see everybody
i did not realize . yeah , you do look a little pale . how soon will you be ready ? a week ?
but you need a man right now . it would not be fair to you to
i take care of the being fair to me department . things have gone to hell this long , they can go a little longer .
see you in a week , roy . i can call you roy ?
and i am perk . short for percy , i am afraid .
good to have you back , roy . i was just looking at
mr . kaggs , i am sorry .
you are turning me down ? makes no sense , roy .
i guess i am just not a leader of men .
oh , come on , roy .
the truth is , mr . kaggs
perk , remember ?
okay , fine . perk , the truth is , i like things the way they are now . pick my own hours , have time for , uh , other activities . . .
a well rounded life . i respect that . but it has to have a center , roy , something you care about , something you can think about .
maybe i am just not ready for that yet .
well , roy , if that is the way you feel , i will not badger you . do not want to lose you as a salesman , too .
oh , i would like to stay on . just keep everything the way it was .
that is what we will do , then . but i tell you what , roy . before i hire anybody else , i will ask you one last time . fair enough ?
so that is your story today ?
they twisted my arm .
they knocked out my tooth !
sure i am . what made you turn up , after all these years ?
i am working down in san diego . just for a few weeks . thought i would drop in on my long lost son .
well . . . you are all right now , i guess . i have to get down to the track .
thanks , uh , lilly .
do not mention it .
i guess i owe you my life .
what happened to your hand ?
just a little accident . i went by your place , picked up your mall . just bills , i will take care of them .
i can take care of my own bills , lilly .
whatever you say . the manager says your boss called . really pulled the wool over everybody s eyes , huh ?
what are you talking about ? so i have got a job . so what ?
stop kidding me ! four years in a town like los ang gleez , and a peanut selling job is the best you can do ? you expect me to believe that ?
it is there . the boss called , you said so yourself .
i like those .
you do not ! roy dillon ? cornball clown pictures ? commission salesman ? it is all a front , is not it ? you are on the grift , i know you are . you are working some angle , and do not tell me you are not because i wrote the book !
you are one to talk . still running playback money for the mob .
that is me . that is who i am . you were never cut out for the rackets , roy , and if you
not as tough as you , huh ?
up to you .
my boss is a guy named bobo justus , back in baltimore . when a long shot gets too much action , i have to put money on that horse at the track , because it is the only way to get the odds down .
sure .
that was my choice , nothing to do with you . i took a chance , and it did not work out .
bluebell came in ?
lucky ? you call that lucky ?
you do not put up with that ! nobody has to put up with that !
i tripped over a chair .
get off the grift , roy .
why ?
i just give you your life . what you do with it is up to you .
roy ! what are you doing in san diego ?
if you come out to the track , do not know me .
that is that ?
four grand . for the hospital . is that enough ?
roy , i do not want money from you .
i pay my debts .
expecting visitors ?
you ought to put a bandage on that .
i thought . . . i was hoping we could play it straight with one another .
i guess not . you will be heading east from here , huh ?
after the meet . back to baltimore .
well . . . nice to see you again , lilly .
well , sure , roy . you want me to drive up ? okay , fine , come on down . it will not be a home cooked meal , you know .
going somewhere ?
somewhere else , that is for sure .
i just came back from phoenix .
oh , yeah ? is the frame holding ?
looks very solid , lilly . sit down . take a minute , tell me about it .
i have really got to
you are dead , lilly , it worked .
not for long . not when they do a fingerprint check .
why should they ? the cops are satisfied .
bobo will not be . he will spend the money to make sure .
myra followed you , huh ?
she must have been the one that blew me off with bobo . i guess to get me running . did you tell her about my stash ?
no .
no , you would not . that is what she was after , though . but why hit on me ?
i would not go in on a deal with her . she blamed you for it .
as though you do what i say .
i sat in there with her , i thought , what do i do now ? run and i have got bobo and the law after me . stay , and how do i explain ?
it is , is not it ? and maybe it is a break for me after all . i have been wanting out of the racket for years , and now i am out . i can make a clean start , and
i am sorry . i hated to take your money , but
i need this , roy . i cannot run without money , and if i cannot run i am dead .
you must have some money .
just a few bucks .
and myra s stuff ?
her credit cards . how far am i gonna get with that ?
far enough . maybe up to san francisco . or st . louis , someplace new . start over .
at what ?
you are smart , lilly , and you are good looking . you will not have any trouble finding a job .
a job ? i have never had a legit job in my life !
well , you are gonna start , if you hope to live through this . a square job and a quiet life . you start showing up at the track or the hot spots and bobo s boys will be all over you .
roy , i know what to do with myself ! it is a big world out there .
not any more . lilly , listen , i am giving you good advice . i am following it myself .
what ?
i thought it over , and you were right . you wanted me out of the rackets , and now
roy , that is fine , but i do not have time for this . bobo
i thought you would be happy for me . after all , you
bobo is not after you ! bobo s after me , and he is goddamn good ! but so am i . i am a survivor , roy . i survive .
i know you do , so that is why
and to survive , my way , i need money . bobo knows about the stash in the car , so i did not dare touch it , not if lilly dillongs dead . so that leaves this .
you want a drink ?
i do not think so . you probably should not either .
no , but i am goddamn thirsty . ice water ?
yeah , sure , that sounds nice .
you do not know what i would do , roy . you have no idea . to live .
i know that is bugging you , of course .
oh ? i did not know anything was .
oh , really ? you have got a legitimate complaint , roy , i do not deny that . i was not a very good mother when you were a kid .
a bad mother . by any standards . i have thought about it , you know , from your side , since then . i know just how bad i was .
uh huh .
i wonder did you ever think about it from my side .
never .
what do you want me to do ? pin a halo on you ? you are doing a pretty good job of that yourself .
and making you feel bad at the same time , huh ? but that is the way i am , you know , the way i have always been . always picking on poor little roy .
for god s sake , lilly !
i gave you your life twice . i am asking you to give me mine once . i need the money .
you are getting off the grift ?
that is right .
that is good . you do not really belong on this side of the fence , you know .
i do not ?
if you stayed a crook , do you think you would live to be my ripe age ?
i do not see why not .
well , uh . . .
sure , sure , that does not count . that is different .
well , it does not matter , does it ? i am getting out .
and that is why you have got to get rid of this money . if you keep it around , it will just make you think how clever you are . it will be a temptation to get back into the game .
if i should get out of the racket , that goes double for you . that is why you have got to change your life completely , go to some town , get a square job , live like a john yourself . if you try to do it your way , what future is in it ?
a future . the only future i have got .
that money would not last forever . and then what ? you would be back in some other part of the rackets . another bobo justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands . this way , you have got to go the square route . you could send me a card when you are settled , i could maybe help out sometimes . . .
that is what it is , is not it ? keep me down . your turn to be in charge , have the power .
roy . . . what if i told you i was not really your mother ? that we were not related ?
there s nothing more to talk about .
lilly , jesus , what are you doing ?
is there nothing i can do , roy , nothing at
you heard the shower , did not you ?
joe , i thought i was gonna be all right by now , i just need a little more
it is not the owner , myra , it is my wife . she knows that is going on . this time , i gotta have the money .
joe , could we talk it over ? do you want a drink ?
my wife sent me here , myra . for the money . she is waiting .
i will have it tonight . nine o clock ? ten ?
this time . . .
i did not teach you that .
let me see how you did that one .
scram . go home .
i cannot . i just left home .
you are too young . you should be in school .
where is the five ?
well , well . in a real hurry , are we ?
you are not taking me for granted , are you ?
that is not granite . if that fell on me , it would not hurt at all .
are you sure ?
roy ?
mm ?
look at me .
oh , i am , baby , believe me .
roy ? it this all we have ?
all ? it ai not bad .
what are you talking abut , myra ? marriage ?
ow ! hey , what are you trying to do , throw me off my game ?
you were bleeding inside , honey . remember that bruise you had ?
you called the doctor , huh ?
well , no , roy . your mother found you .
her job .
i want to know everything about you .
i do not see why you are still here . you look healthy to me .
i just do what the doctor says , babe .
you are just comfortable , that is all . you do not even ask to go home . you just lie around , let your mama take care of you .
mama !
who else is paying for all this ? you badmouth the woman all the time , but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you .
i will pay lilly back , do not you worry about that .
i do not like to come here , roy . every time i do , your mother comes in and makes remarks .
that is just lilly s way .
and you never defend me . you are afraid of her .
oh , do not be stupid .
get well soon .
every day in every way .
i do not see why we have to take the train .
what if we want to drive somewhere while we are there ?
big spender .
no .
you were right , i had to get out of that hospital . nothing wrong with me any more .
i will sign that affidavit .
great to get away , take it easy . next week , i will get back to work .
you already went back to work .
what ?
i watched you . working the tap on those soldier boys .
working the what ?
the tap . what you do for a living .
i am a salesman .
you are on the grift . same as me .
myra , i am not following this .
you talk the lingo . that is your pitch ?
the long end . big con .
nobody does that single o .
i was teamed ten years with the best in the business . cole langley .
i have heard the name .
it was beautiful . and getting better all the time .
is that right ?
he did not think they were risks . he was so good , roy , he could just play with the mark .
and when he got serious ?
he would explain he had to have cash , so there would not be any paper trail for the sec . and a lot of cash , or it was not worth while . the least we ever took was forty thousand , and the most was one hundred eighty five thousand dollars ! from one sucker !
i thought these people were broke .
no , no , roy , just cash poor . they had savings accounts , stocks to sell , houses to mortgage . sell their wife s jewelry . oh , they had a lot of money , when they put their minds to it . or when i put their minds to it . i stayed with them , that is the roper s job , made them get up every penny they could raise , turn it all over to cole .
and a month later , the sucker calls the cops and you are on the run .
no no ! he never calls the cops , not after we give him the blow off .
oh , roy , it was great ! we were rolling in dough , lived wherever we wanted , only pulled two or three scams a year .
what happened to cole ?
he retired .
where ?
upstate .
upstate where ?
atascadero .
i just bet you are , too . and now you are trying to rope me .
join up with you ! i watched you , roy , i have been watching you , wondering if i should talk about this at all , or maybe just . . .
take a hike , you mean ?
i need a partner , roy . i need an inside man , and you are it . you could be as wonderful as cole .
i do not know , myra , i never had partners . i never needed them .
think about it . okay ?
i still do not see why we have to have separate rooms . you expect your father to come through ?
separate bathrooms , darling . i will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over .
things a man is not supposed to know .
you do not mind , really , do you , roy ? it is been such a wonderful evening , i guess i just wore myself out .
yeah ?
open your door .
what ? what for ?
you i do not know .
if you could have seen your face when i told you good night ! you looked so , so . . . ah !
you were gone for a while .
i went out to delmar .
the track ? did you run into lilly ?
i saw her .
she did not see you , in other words .
i am not trying to make trouble , roy . it is just , she is always so nasty to me , i thought , who is she to be so high and mighty . i saw her out there , and i called a friend of mine in baltimore , so now i know who she is .
you must have some very knowledgeable friends .
i am well connected , roy , cole introduced me to a lot of people . very valuable . valuable for us .
running your broker scam , you mean .
you and me , roy . what a team we will make . we think alike we get along together . once or twice a year we take some slob , the rest of the time we live like this . you will not regret this , roy .
regret what ? i did not say i was coming aboard .
but why not ? i thought it was settled . that is holding you back ?
you mean , it would be too tough to give me a turndown here . easier on home grounds .
and hello to you , too .
i called a fellow i know in tulsa , the one who plays my chauffeur . there s a sucker there he says is made for us . and a boroker that just shut down , we can use their office , not change a thing ! now , i can scrape up ten grand without much trouble . that leaves fifteen or twenty for your end . we could start this weekend , get the sucker into position
wait a minute ! when did this happen , that we are partners ?
what ?
the last i looked , we were just talking things over .
but the setup s there . it is there now .
i do not think i need it .
you are too good for the small time , roy . move up to where there s big dough to be made , and you do not have to stick your neck out every day .
do not i get any say in this ?
no ! because i
that is what i say .
what ?
what i say is , no . we do not do partners .
for christ s sake , why not ?
mostly , because you scare the shit out of me . i have seen people like you before , baby . double tough and sharp as they come , and you get what you want or else . but you do not make it work forever .
bullshit !
what is it ? that is going on ?
i am happy the way i am .
by god , it is your mother . it is lilly .
what ?
that is that ?
you watch that mouth .
roy dillon ?
yes ?
lieutenant pierson , phoenix police . i have a car here .
i realize this is a shock .
well , mostly , i do not believe it .
that is natural .
no . i mean , i do not believe it . lilly is not a suicide . i know my mother , nothing would make her check out .
i am sorry , it was her all right . her gun , even .
gun ?
i grant you , it is a little odd , shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it , but it was hers , all right . it really is your mother , mister dillon .
it may be lilly , but it is not suicide .
do you have any particular reason to say that ?
my mother . . . well , i guess it does not matter now . she worked for gamblers . she always knew they might turn on her some day .
not that it matters . this is the morgue ?
you up to it now ?
sure . let s get it over .
one thing i have to caution you about . a gunshot wound . . .
yes , i know , i know .
well , uh , you know , she ate the gun .
what ?
i am sorry , that is an unfortunate phrase , it slipped out , i am , to tell you the truth , mr . dillon , this is not an everyday occurrence around here .
ate the gun . oh .
someone who knows her well could still identify her , that is not the problem . it is just there s , uh , it is likely to be a shock .
not many laughs in this room , eh ?
oh , jesus .
no question , huh ?
that is that , then .
mr . simms .
why yes , mr . dillon . here s a potential new neighbor , looking at
well , thank you . and thank them .
sickness comes to us all , mister dillon .
that is true , mr . simms .
we never know when and we never know why . we never know how . the only blessed thing we know is , it will be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time . just when you have got tickets to the world series . and that is the way the permanent waves .
well , i am back now . i just wanted you to know . gotta rush .
no thanks , i am not thirsty .
why am i here ?
they said on the phone you were assigned to the meyers case .
with all due respect , detective , you cannot go blaming every brutal murder in illinois on michael meyers .
pamela whittington was a long time associate of dr . loomis . her home office was ransacked . it was chock full of loomis files on meyers . it would say that makes meyers a suspect , would not you ?
well , when you put it that way .
right . so why do not we get on with this investigation ?
one set of muddy shoe prints .
where , judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints , she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell .
unable to escape , she turns and attacks the killer , but does not connect .
the killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought iron poker .
as which point she drops to her knees in pain . . .
impressive , blake . where would you learn how to do that ?
carter .
it is blake . meet me at grand view .
where ?
the cemetery . . .
you take all your dates here . blake ?
only the real stiffs .
i can be real stiff .
that is it ?
care to join me ?
come on , carter . you know it is michael .
what do you want me to do , put out an a . p . b . on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone ?
yes .
carter .
we are sorry to startle you , miss tate .
detective carter from the haddonfield p . d .
i will be damned .
mind if we sit down ?
i would prefer you did not . i am very busy .
okay , then how about we ask you a few questions ?
detective . . .
carter .
. . . i think it would be best if you both left .
might want to stop and think about the safety of your students , miss tate .
i never stop thinking about it , detective . the only way in or out of this school is through that gate , and it is secured at all times .
funny , we just drove right in .
bruce . . . that is going on ? the kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival .
a dead body ?
it is amy kramer .
my god . . .
do you know who did this ?
well , eddie catero did not show up for work this morning . . . parents say he never came home last night . car s still missing .
think eddie had something to do with it ?
besides , it is historically inaccurate .
what the fuck are you talking about ?
michael meyers never used a meat cleaver . it was a butcher knife .
who are you , the serial killer police ? what difference does it make ?
another historical inaccuracy .
hey , mis whittington , that is up ?
my blood pleasure . you scared the hell out of me .
oh . sorry . i am on my way to the ring and
i think someone broke into my house .
no shit ? !
jimmy , what are you doing ?
checking out your place .
no . wait for the police .
nothing to fear . the coast is clear .
you sure ?
totally . i checked all the rooms and closets . . .
nothing s missing ?
do not think so . but they sure did a real number on your office . crap everywhere .
my office ?
nothing s changed since yesterday , or last week , or last month . . . the answer s still no .
what the
i am sixteen , keri . i should be able to live wherever i want .
and i should have a son who calls me mom . looks like we are both shit out of luck .
okay , you win . i will call you mom . now can i move into the dorms ?
well , dad thinks it is okay .
you are father thinks it is okay to run off to cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top . somehow his opinion does not count .
i promise not to run off to cancun .
forget it .
the dorms are only fifty feet away . you could practically see into my window . so , what difference does it make ?
alright , i was wrong . there is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster .
i took the padlock off your door . what more do you want ?
where are you going ?
to the bathroom . can i do that alone or do you want to watch ?
you are twisted .
shit , john ! what the hell were you doing out there ? !
nothing .
you are kidding with that answer , right ?
i just went for a walk . it is no big deal .
wrong . there are rules in this house and you are going to follow them whether you like it or not .
or what ? you are gonna shoot me ?
it is an option .
well , maybe if you would let me live in the dorms , i would not have to sneak out to spend time with my friends .
oh , so now it is my fault ?
i am sorry , alright ? it was just a stupid joke .
you some kind of fugitive or something ?
now you are joking , right ?
wait a minute . . . slow down . . . you are telling me michael meyers is my uncle ?
yes .
any other psychotic relatives i should know about ? jason ? freddy krueger ?
no .
why did not you tell me ?
where are you going ?
he found you , did not he ?
get on the bus .
where is molly ? she is not in her room . . .
just get on the bus .
i am not leaving without her .
john , you cannot help her now .
what ? where is she ?
oh , god . . . no . . . not molly .
yeah , me too , keri .
call me laurie , will ya ?
keri . . . . laurie . . . how about if i just call you mom ?
shelve the barf bag . it is the key to the main gate .
where would you get it ?
swiped it from my mom s desk yesterday .
you stole it ?
not me .
why not ?
nah , i did not tell her where i went .
what are you doing here ? !
i came to see you .
i can see that . why ?
can i come in ?
are you crazy ? you will get caught .
then you come out here .
then i will get caught .
well , i am not going until i talk to you .
you really think eddie killed her ?
you saw that michael meyers display . you have got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that .
you look kind of cold .
i am okay .
better ?
molly , of all the people . . . if i cannot trust my resident assistant , then what ?
i know . i am really , really sorry , miss tate . please let me keep the job . . . it is the only way i can afford to stay here .
okay , tell you what . . . you can still be the school r . a . , but no dance tomorrow night .
linda ! he killed linda !
who ? !
are not they doing a terrific job this year ?
looks great . it does .
you okay ? you seem a little off .
it is john , is not it ?
it is always john .
still wants to move out ?
he is been living out of moving boxes for three months .
this kid just wants his freedom .
it is not going to happen .
the tighter you squeeze , the harder he will try to break free .
oh , please . . . you get that out of a fortune cookie ?
i am going into town . . . run a few errands before dark . need anything ?
a box of fortune cookies . . . i am running out of advice .
hey , you alright ?
what ?
what are you looking at ?
there s something i have to tell you both . it is going to sound strange . . .
what ?
my name has not always been keri tate . it was once laurie strode .
who ?
michael meyers .
the serial killer ?
no , will , this is not the alcohol talking . it is the truth .
i cannot believe this is happening .
you just dropped a shitload on him . . . give him some time to digest it .
are you going to leave , too ?
so you are really michael meyers sister ?
yeah .
not a real fan of halloween humor , will .
oh , right . sorry .
i am gonna head back to the office . . . finish up some things .
keri , you all right ?
we have got to get these kids out of here . . .
look , they are staring right at us .
wait .
what is it ?
i have to pee .
cannot you hold it ?
you aced it , did not you ?
fucking a .
that is this ?
better her than me .
ooooh , busted .
shane s going as a condom .

blaaaaaggghhhhh !

nope . hey , you think i will win scariest costume ?
linda , you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus .
thanks !

condom boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria .
but the dance is in the gymnasium .
let the party begin .

home is here in grandma and grandpa s new house . at least while i am in college . remember our deal .
the kids at school said this is a haunted house that a bad man used to live here .
they did , did they ? since when did we start listening to the kids at school ?
but i have seen him !
you have been watching too much tv .
he says things . bad things .
no , mom keep it on !
mom , i want to go to the fair . . .
come on , mom . we are gonna miss all the fun stuff !
mommy , i am scared .
there s nothing to be scared of , baby . it is just another storm . try to get some sleep .
i cannot . the voice man is coming to get me .
no one s coming to get you . not while i am around .
promise ?
mommy ! ! !
shitheads . . . defacing my property . i showed them . . .
relax , john . they were just kids .
see what i am talking about ?
what is it this time ?
he told me about the terrible things that happened here . in our house .
what the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without
john , they sound jamie lloyd this morning ! someone tried to kill her !
what in god s name are you talking about , woman ? when are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows ?
i am getting the children out of here . at least until we know what we are dealing with . john , i want you to come with us .
debra , you are fucking insane .
i have been knocking . the door was open . is everything all right in here ?
who are you ?
he crept up these stairs and made his way into this room . his sister s room . right here . where it all began .
what makes you think he will come here again ?
this house is sacred to him . it is the source of his memories his rage . mrs . strode , i beg you . do not let your family suffer the same fast as laurie and her daughter .
jamie ? but i thought she was
what should i do ?
lock the doors and call your husband . get your family as far away from haddonfield as possible .
god . . . this cannot be true .
so they are trying to kill you and your baby . do not tell me . your name also happens to be rosemary .
come on , sweetheart what is this ? who s coming ?
so they are trying to kill you and your baby . do not tell me . your name also happens to be rosemary .
no , please listen ! they are coming . . . coming for me and my baby .
come on , sweetheart what is this ? who s coming ?
she was not here when i brought danny home from
my , god ! what have you done to him ?
i did not he got in a fight and i
do you know how insane this is ? who am i supposed to be looking for ?
god , that is wrong with him ?
kyle s mother might be dead for all i know . now i am afraid he could be next .
why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby ?
it was there when i found him this morning . it looks like some kind of letter or number or
runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in northern europe thousands of years ago . they were symbols carved out of stone or pieces of wood . of all the runes , thorn had the most negative influence . cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic .
black magic . . . in ancient times , thorn was believed to cause sickness , famine and death . translated literally , it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices . . . on the celtic celebration of samhain .
halloween .
where are you going ?
danny ? ! danny !
where is the baby ? !
danny ! danny , where are you ? !
what now ? !
come on !
christ , what a night ! not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road !
unlike you , sam , i learned many years ago not to second guess the motives of my fellow man . remember what freud said sometimes a cigar is just a cigar . or , in this case , a drink is just a drink .
i hope you did not come all the way out here in this storm just to quote freud .
as always , your keen powers of perception astound me . and you are right . i have come to celebrate . after thirty two years as psychiatric administrator , guess who has been named smith s groves new chief of staff .
but surely rogers is not
we need you , dr . loomis .
you should know that it is not wise to play halloween pranks on me .
but with rogers and his house of hacks gone , you would make the rules . just think it over .
it was her voice . on the radio . it was jamie . calling for me .
you do not know that for sure . it could have been anyone . a practical joke . kids .
it was jamie lloyd . she came back , as i knew she would one day . and whatever has brought her back has brought michael back as well .
after six years ? sam , she died with him in that explosion after the
notify haddonfield s sheriff tell him we are on our way . i want the entire staff on alert . we go to code red lockdown for twenty four hours . if he is alive , i plan on bringing him back .
what is that ?
sam , do not let them take care of her .
there you are . who was that boy ?
there s more people moving eastbound down old reservoir road past the elementary school .
any word on the location of the strodes ?
no one s home . checked it out myself .
that is wrong ? that is happened to jamie ?
where is the child ?
come now , sam . this is a gathering of old friends . i know how difficult this must be for you a man of your upbringing and integrity but now that i am in charge i felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth . after all , you are the only one around here who s still in the dark , as it were . this is not the way i wanted to tell you , but you have really given me no other choice .
this is madness , wynn .
your madness is another mangs greatness . this is the way things have always been . you have just been too blinded by your own reality to see . but having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways . you always did come through our loyal watch dog . finding him . bringing him back to us once he would finished his work . although after you had that nasty stroke the last time , i had to go after him myself . and what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell .
it was you .
sometimes a cigar is just a cigar .
why did you take jamie ?
she has the gift the blood of thorn running through her veins . michael s mother had it , too . so for six years i incubated her , prepared her for this night . michael has served his purpose . and soon we will have a new progeny .
jamie s baby . . .
there you go trying to make sense again . it is a curse . handed down through countless generations . as ageless as this celebration which you call halloween .
samhain .
you have created a monster .
no ! ! !
stay away , sam .
yes ?
dr . loomis , thank god you are here . you heard her , did not you ? it was jamie .
i am sorry , but do i know you
yes . . . tommy . what are you doing here ?
what do you know about michael ?
i know he is alive . people in this town they want us to believe he is dead . but i know . i have always known .
right now at least one girl is dead and jamie lloyd is in there fighting for her life . she is the last of his blood line . if she dies
who else knew i had the baby ? !
no one .
no there had to be someone else . who knew ? !
run , tommy ! ! ! run ! ! !
miss me , baby ?
i dunno , boy .
hm ?
it is a bitch .
a bitch .
did not recognize you .
we have never met .
i wonder who will recognize us first ? they will wet their pants .
i hope the men do . i would rather the women did not .
home , sweet home .
one thing , anyway at least penelope did not throw out all your crap . i bet alice threw out all my crap after i would been gone a week .
it appears that we are going to have to wait awhile for any more action here , colonel . why do not you run on home while the evening s young .
home . jesus . i am like this . home !
home is important to a man .
you know what gets me ?
no .
how all the magazines show tits today .
um .
used to be against the law , did not it ?
i suppose .
home .
you know what gets me ?
oh , shit .
how everybody says fuck and shit all the time . i used to be scared shitless i would say fuck or shit in public , by accident . now everybody says fuck and shit , fuck and shit all the time . something very big must have happened while we were out of the country .
looseleaf will you get the hell home ?
at least we found the diamonds .
at least !
i would really feel stupid if we did not bring anything back home .
it is enough that you have brought yourself home !
i wish you would tell alice that . and that goddamn mrs . wheeler .
tell them yourself !
you do not know my mother in law , boy .
after eight years in the jungle with you , i know mrs . wheeler better than i know anybody in the universe !
i did not tell you everything .
the time we were in a tree for fourteen days , you certainly tried to tell me everything about mrs . wheeler .
i did not even scratch the surface . you are lucky , boy . you come home , and nobody s here . when i go home , everybody s going to be there .
this room is full of ghosts .
you know what gets me ?
go home !
thank god we found the fucking diamonds !
the hell with the diamonds !
you were rich before . this is the first time i was ever rich .
go home ! show them how rich you are for a change !
can i have the cadillac ?
take the cadillac and drive it off a cliff , for all i care .
what will you do for transportation ?
i will buy a hundred more cadillacs . go home !
you know what gets me about that cadillac ?
go home !
when i drive it , i feel like i am in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum . i do not hear anything , i do not feel anything . i figure somebody else is driving . it is a bitch .
go home .
i am liable to find anything !
that is the point ! walk in there and find whatever there is to find before alice can cover it up .
i know , i know . i dunno . at least she is in the same house . sure was spooky , looking in the window there , and there she was .
so long , colonel .
you know what gets me ?
let s talk about it some other time .
how short the skirts are .
good night , colonel . it is been beautiful .
you know what gets me ? those guys who went to the moon ! to the moon , boy !
leave me alone ! after eight years of horrendously close association , the time has come to part ! i crave solitude and time for reflection and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood . you and i may not meet again for months !
months ?
i am certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow , and i will not welcome your horning back into mine . a chapter has ended . we are old comrades at a parting of the ways .
i have been looking at motorcycles .
go home !
you ever own a motorcycle ?
you are right ! we will take a trip . a trip is what we will take . i do not want to talk about motorcycles . i do not want to talk about tits . go home !
and how were things ?
otherwise , how are things ?
could have happened to anybody .
first nagasaki now this .
i dunno , boy .
the educational process .
i guess . you are lucky you do not have any old people around here .
that is funny about that ?
excuse me .
one of them is the doctor , whose weapons are compassion , unselfishness , peacefulness maudlin concern .
huh .
he and his love are like a retiarius . do you know what a retiarius is ?
he is a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and does not wear anything but a jockstrap .
how do you know that ?
you told me .
when ?
when we were up in the tree so long with the bats .
oh . i would forgotten .
fourteen times you told me . i counted .
really ?
you would get this funny look in your eyes , and i would say to myself , oh , jesus he is going to tell me what a retiarius is again .
go to the funeral ?
of course ! not only go to it but go to it in full uniform ! rent a uniform !
that is against the law , is not it ? i cannot wear a uniform anymore .
wear your uniform and every decoration , and let them despise you , if they dare .
alice would be absolutely tear ass .
when i was a naive young recruit in spain , i used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings , shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos . i now understand it was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform uncontrollable fear . to our women .
i did not know we had any women left .
the world is teeming with women ours to enjoy .
i told you the uniform would not help .
it helped more than you know . down deep , people were deeply affected .
so , kid how they hanging ? or do not you say that to a little kid ?
of course you will go ! you are going to fly the helicopter .
i dunno .
you are so low ! look at that beautiful red meat . you have not touched it .
sorry . at least you have got a place to come back to . i do not have a place to come back to anymore .
all the more reason to go to africa .
i dunno . you know . i used to really love that alice . do you know that ?
you know her for what she is now garbage .
i dunno .
hi , penelope .
go live in a safe deposit box with your things . looseleaf jesus i would not want to be married to him . you know ?
that is this ?
i would not want to be married to me . we are too crazy . you know ?
in what way , pray tell ?
i did not like that violin thing . that was sad .
tit for tat as simple as that .
you never played a violin .
you did ?
yeah . i practically forgot . but after you busted that thing , i got to thinking , jesus maybe i will start the violin again . that did not just belong to woodly . that belonged to everybody . maybe he would have sold it to me , and i could have some fun . after you busted the violin , boy , and penelope walked out , i thought to myself , jesus who could blame her ?
maybe it is time you got out .
me ?
you .
okay . okay .
you are an imbecile .
i know you think that .
everybody thinks that .
anybody who would drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb .
the one direct , decisive , intelligent act of your life !
i do not think so . it could have been .
if what ?
if i had not done it . if i would said to myself , screw it . i am going to let all those people down there live .
they were enemies . we were at war .
yeah , jesus but wars would be a lot better , i think , if guys would say to themselves sometimes , jesus i am not going to do that to the enemy . that is too much . you could have been the manufacturer of that violin there , even though you do not know how to make a violin , just by not busting it up . i could have been the father of all those people in nagasaki , and the mother , too , just by not dropping the bomb . i sent em to heaven instead and i do not think there is one .
hello .
how are you , honeybunch ?
is penelope in ?
the posies are for her ?
i wanted to apologize .
you have come to the right man .
i forgot my vacuum cleaner .
i forget mine for years on end .
i cannot get over how you guys are my friends . harold ryan and looseleaf harper are my friends .
our pleasure .
eight years you guys were together through thick and thin .
for seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged or we would have been home long before now , believe me . we were saved from starvation by the lupi loopo indians , who fed us a strange blue soup .
blue soup .
are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die ?
i would rather go to viet nam .
would somebody please pass me the catsup ?
what you say is , pass the fucking catsup .
insurance !
what an awful sound !
it is possible , of course , that you will die in africa .
i have considered that .
selling vacuum cleaners is not the best preparation you could have .
i just want one true adventure before i die .
fifty years ?
you are making a joke .
i am interested in long term expectations .
it is engineered to last about fifteen years .
if i were married to him , i sure would not walk out .
who s going to fly our helicopter now ?
what ?
we got to get another pilot .
for what ?
for africa .
do you really think that harold ryan would go to africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman ?
you invited me .
to make an ass of yourself .
what went wrong ?
we are ahead of schedule , that is all . you are finding out here what you would have found out in africa that you are a rabbit , born to be eaten alive .
gee whiz
it would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us .
i would not drop my gun .
you are hollow , like a woman .
i am smarter than looseleaf .
he can shoot ! he can hold his ground ! he can attack ! you are in your proper profession right now sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives , closet drunkards every one .
how do you know how i would act in africa ?
look how you are acting now ! this is a moment of truth , and you are almost crying . slug me !
you are my buddy .
out ! out !
no matter what you say to me , i still think you are the greatest guy i ever knew .
out !
you you are not going to have any friends left , if you do not watch out .
anybody home ?
as a matter of fact
sir ?
as a matter of fact i am home .
hello .
hello .
you were about to ask a question ?
are you do you
ask it !
do you know who wanda june is ?
life has denied me that thrill .
do you mind if i ask who you are ?
mind ? god , yes , i mind . i am your father s friend . a man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago .
dr . woodly .
dr . woodly . i should make a little list .
is anybody besides you here now ?
the doctor was called away on an emergency . i think it was birth .
where is mom ?
you do not know where your mother is ? does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night ?
she went to the fight with herb shuttle , i guess .
you think you could find me a pencil and paper ?
and you have been roaming the streets while your mother is god knows where ?
i was going to a funny movie , but i changed my mind . if you are depressed , laughing does not help much . when did you know my father ?
man and boy .
everybody says he was so brave .
even this herb shuttle , you said ?
he worships father .
ah ! and what sort of man is this worshiper ?
he is a vacuum cleaner salesman .
i see . and he came into the apartment one day , to demonstrate his wares , and your mother , as it happened , was charmingly en deshabille
she met him at college .
college !
they were in the same creative writing class .
college ?
she has a master s degree in english literature .
what a pity ! educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine swiss watch . everything stops . and the doctor ? he worships your father , too ?
he insults him all the time .
excellent !
that is good about that ?
it makes life spicy .
he does not do it in front of me , but he does it with mother . you know what he called father one time ?
no .
harold , the patron saint of taxidermy .
what does he do of an athletic nature ?
nothing . he plays a violin in a doctors quartet .
aha ! he has a brilliant military record , i am sure .
he was a stretcher bearer in the korean war . were you in a war with father ?
big ones , little ones , teeny weeny ones just and otherwise .
tell me some true stories about dad .
dad ? dad . the boy wants tales of derring do . name a country .
england ?
oh hell .
dad was never in england ?
behind a desk for a little while . a desk ! they had him planning air raids . a city cannot flee like a coward or fight like a man , and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of harold ryan . there was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice , and that was making the choice himself . ask about spain , where he was the youngest soldier in the abraham lincoln brigade . he was a famous sniper . they called him la picadura the sting .
the sting .
as in death , where is thy sting ? he killed at least fifty men , wounded hundreds more .
the sting .
ask about the time he and i were parachuted into yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band in the war against the nazis .
tell me that .
i saw your father fight major siegfried von konigswald , the beast of yugoslavia , hand to hand .
tell me that ! tell me that !
hid by day fought by night . at sunset one day , your father and i , peering through field glasses , saw a black mercedes draw up to a village inn . it was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car . out of the mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history the beast of yugoslavia .
wow .
we blacked our hands and faces . at midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village . the name of the village was mhravitch . remember that name !
mhravitch .
we came up behind a sentry , and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound .
uck .
do not care for cold steel ? a knife is worse than a bullet ?
i do not know .
the story gets hairier . should i stop ?
go on .
we caught another kraut alone in a back lane . your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire . your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire . that is nicer than a knife , is not it as long as you do not look at the face afterwards . the face turns a curious shade of avocado . i must ask the doctor why that is . at any rate , we stole into the back of the inn , and , with the permission of the management , we poisoned the wine of six krauts who were carousing there .
where did you get the poison ?
we carried cyanide capsules . we were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured . it was your father s opinion that the krauts needed them more than we did at the time .
mhravitch . remember that name .
mhravitch .
the name will live forever . it was there that harold ryan slew the beast of yugoslavia . mhravitch .
when i grow up , i am going to go to mhravitch .
it is rather a disappointment these days . it is not there any more .
sir ?
the germans shot everybody who lived there , then leveled it , plowed it , planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground . they wished revenge for the slaying of the beast of yugoslavia . to their twisted way of thinking , your father had butchered an eagle scout . play lots of contact sports ?
i wanted to go out for football , but mom was afraid i would get hurt .
you are supposed to get hurt !
dr . woodly says he is seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football . he says that when there s a war , everybody goes but football players .
does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that ?
they are not engaged .
he seems to think they are . he told me that were .
oh no , no , no , no , no . it cannot be . how embarrassing .
you are a very good boy to respond that way .
no , no , no , no , no .
i would like to use the sanitary facilities , if i may .
yes , wife , it is . come here , boy . your father is home .
wants to fix up her makeup , no doubt .
is looseleaf harper alive ?
alive and hale . he is throwing a little surprise party for his own family . is your mother often this unstable ? penelope !
she is a real heavy sleeper sometimes .
why do not you go to bed son .
i cannot take my eyes off you .
tomorrow s another day . paul you know what my english literature teacher said about you ?
cannot it keep till morning ?
she said you were legendary . i wrote a theme about you , and she said , your father is a legendary hero out of the golden age of heroes .
that is nice . you thank her for me . go to bed and get lots of sleep , and then you thank her in the morning .
tomorrow s saturday . anyway , she is dead .
penelope !
she was killed in the park two months ago in the daytime .
penelope !
she was on her way home from a meeting of the african violet society , and they got her .
will you go to bed ?
yes sir . if you cannot wake mom up , i have got double decker bunks .
dad s got jungle fever , mom . what will i do ? mom !
damn .
play ?
a hundred dollars !
the smallest thing i have got .
can i get dressed first ?
dad
could not you have vanished quietly out the back door ?
a hundred dollars for breakfast ?
what kind of exercise ?
i am a man .
we have got to do something to make this boy s voice change . i wonder if we could not get bull balls somewhere , and fry em up . still miss your mother ?
no .
dad ?
who was it ?
mom ?
that is this ?
nothing .
that is a rifle you have ?
no .
of course it is . is it loaded ?
no .
that is a cartridge , if i am not mistaken . gunpowder , bullet , cartridge case , and fulminate of mercury percussion cap all set to go . paul i was cleaning it .
pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber where it belongs .
gee whiz , dad
welcome to manhood , you little sparrowfart ! load that gun !
dad
then speak , by god ! can you fight with words ?
i do not want to fight you .
get mad ! tell me you do not like the way i treat your mother ! tell me you wish i would never come home !
it is your house , dad .
i do not know what i hope . but i do not think you care what i hope , anyway . you do not know me . you do not know her , either . i do not think you know anybody . you talk to everybody just the same .
i am talking to you gently now .
how do you do . my name is penelope ryan . this is a simple minded play about men who enjoy killing and those who do not .
hamburger heaven .
can i help you , sir ?
i think so , daughter . how old are you ?
eighteen and a half .
a springbok , an oryx , a gemsbok a gazelle .
sir ?
raw hamburger , please and a whole onion . i want to eat the onion like an apple . do you understand ?
yes , sir . it was a very unusual automobile . it was a cadillac , but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be . and what to drink ?
what time do you get off work , my child ?
i am sorry , sir , i am engaged to be married . my boyfriend would be mad if i went out with another man .
did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire ?
i am engaged .
daughter i love you very much .
you do not even know me .
you are woman . i know woman well .
this is crazy .
destiny often seems that way . you are going to marry me .
what do you do for a living ?
my parents died in an automobile accident when i was sixteen years old . they left me a brewery and a baseball team and other things . i live for a living . i have just come back from kenya in africa . i have been hunting mau mau there .
some kind of animal ?
how do you do ?
how do you do , mrs . ryan ? i would heard you were beautiful , and so you are . am i intruding here ?
not at all .
that is the matter ?
give us time .
like hugging a lamp post .
give us time , harold to adjust to your being alive .
you were well adjusted to my being dead ?
we adjust to what there is to adjust to . perhaps paul , being young , can adjust to joy or grief immediately . i hope he can . i will take a little longer . i will be as quick as i can .
what sort of time period do you have in mind ? half an hour ? an hour ?
i do not know . this is a new disease to me .
disease ?
situation .
this reunion is not what i imagined it would be .
a telegram a phone call might have helped .
seemed the most honest way to begin life together again natural , unrehearsed .
well enjoy the natural , honest , unrehearsed result surgical shock .
you feel that you are behaving as a woman should ?
bluh .
that is that all about ?
we thought a doctor might help .
your old beau ?
we thought it was an emergency .
i do not want that chancre mechanic in here .
he is a very decent man , harold .
we all are .
should not you lie down ?
when i am dead or fucking .
paul said you were awfully sick .
you know what i want ? i want you both to be friends . i know you both , respect you both . you should be friends .
nothing would please me more .
i am so glad you like each other . i was so scared , so scared .
harold !
i could carve a better man out of a banana !
please
he does not deserve this ! you do not know him . it is not fair !
awful . i cannot tell you how sorry i am .
say hello to your mother .
now that is what i call fun .
ghastly , cruel , unnecessary .
you will get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again . you used to eat it up .
i did ?
we were one hell of a pair and we will be one again . what we need is a honeymoon . let s start right now .
a trip , you mean ?
he has not had breakfast yet .
honeymoon ! honeymoon ! say it honeymoon !
it is so so stark .
you used to like it stark !
just bang we have a honeymoon .
now turn around , if you would .
turn around ?
i am going to touch your shoulders very gently now . you must not scream . so tense , so tense .
you should not have talked to norbert that way .
you are thinking with your brain instead of your body . that is why you are so tense ! forget norbert . relax . it is body time .
i have a brain .
i have some change !
breakfast ?
and lots of orange juice oceans of orange juice .
mrs . wheeler is dead .
all right bring me a side order of mrs . wheeler . oh , hell sit down , colonel . penelope will bring you some chow .
that is the most heartless statement i ever heard pass between human lips .
which one ?
bring me a side order of mrs . wheeler .
she is up in heaven now . she did not hear . she is experiencing nothing but pure happiness . there s nothing nicer than that . chow ! harold ryan wants chow !
what a honeymoon .
honeymoon temporarily canceled . the boy should still go out and exercise . i have the impression he never gets any exercise . he simply bloats himself with fig newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators .
you are wrong .
chow , chow , chow ! god damn it nutriment !
we are all going to have to go out for breakfast . the cook quit yesterday .
cook , by god ! cook ! you are the nigger now .
people do not use that word any more .
do not lecture me on race relations . i do not have a molecule of prejudice . i have been in battle with every kind of man there is . i have been in bed with every kind of woman there is from a laplander to a tierra del fuegian . if i would ever been to the south pole , there would be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me . cook !
you leave me so so without without dignity .
people now have dignity when frying eggs ?
they do not have to feel like slaves .
i should have torn that door off its hinges . should have scrogged her ears off . should have broken the bed . what do you want ? well ?
i i was wondering is there anything you should not eat because of jungle fever ?
let me guess breakfast is served ?
no .
what then ?
i do not wish to be scrogged ever . i never heard that word , but when i heard it , i knew it was one thing i never wanted to have happen to me .
that is what you are supposed to say .
this is not a coy deception . i do not want to be scrogged . i want love . i want tenderness .
you do not know you want . that is the way god built you !
i will not be scrogged . i remember one time i saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers , and you promised me that the fish could not feel .
it could not !
i would like to have the expert opinion of the fish along with yours .
fish cannot feel .
well , i can . some injuries , spiritual or physical , can be excruciating to me . i am not a silly carhop any more . maybe you are right about fish . when i was a carhop , i did not feel much more than a fish would . but i have been sensitized . i have ideas now and solid information . i know a lot more now and a lot of it has to do with you .
such as ? . . .
the whole concept of heroism and its sexual roots .
tell me about its sexual roots .
it is complicated and i do not want to go into it now , because it is bound to sound insulting even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted . it is just the truth .
i like the truth . i would not be alive today if i were not one of the biggest fans truth ever had .
well part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long , and make awful messes while they are there .
go on .
and they have very mixed feelings about women . they hate them in a way . one reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently . they can scrog them , as you say for revenge .
you learned this in some college course ?
i learned a lot of things in college . actually it was norbert who told me that .
the doctor .
yes .
and what is his most cherished possession ?
his most cherished possession ? his violin , i guess .
and he keeps it in his apartment ?
yes .
and no one s there now ?
i do not think so .
that is too bad . i would rather have him at home to see what i am going to do .
what are you going to do ?
he did his best to destroy my most precious possession , which is the high opinion women have of me . i am now going to even that score . i am going to break in his door and i am going to smash his violin .
no you are not !
why not ?
i came for my clothes .
sneaking in the back door .
i rang . it seemed like the proper door for a servile , worthless organism to use .
your clothes are at the city dump by now . perhaps you can get a map from the department of sanitation .
i came for paul as well .
if he wants to go .
you took him to the funeral , i hear .
he would never seen a corpse . he is seen a dozen now .
a dozen ?
it is a big and busy funeral home .
did you like it , dear ?
it is not a matter of liking . it is a matter of getting used to death as a perfectly natural thing . would you mind leaving ? no woman ever walks out on harold ryan , and then comes back for anything .
unless she has nerve .
more nerve than the doctor , i must admit . he has not been home for two days . has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television and the violin ?
he knows you shattered his violin .
i am dying to hear of his reaction . the thrill of smashing something is not in the smashing , but in the owner s reactions .
he cried .
about a broomstick and a cigar box and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat .
two hundred years old .
he feels awful loss which was precisely my intention .
he had hoped that someone would be playing it still two hundred years from now .
things .
well what have we here ? a family .
almost a christmas scene .
goodbye , goodbye , goodbye .
just one favor .
money ? there s plenty of that . mildred got the brewery . you will probably get the baseball team .
testimonials of that sort are are beyond my range . i do not do them well . that is a failing , i know .
see how you have upset him . he was so merry and hale before you came home .
how unhappy he is going to be alone in his room .
he will play with his rifle , i expect . that will cheer him up .
rifle ?
i bought him a twenty two yesterday on the way home from hamburger heaven . and where is the good doctor ? have you two feathered a love nest somewhere ?
he is in east st . louis with his mother visiting an aunt .
last i heard , his mother was going alone .
he is afraid of you , harold . he knew you would want to fight him . he does not know anything about fighting . he hates pain .
and you , a supposedly healthy woman , do not detest him for his cowardice ?
it seems highly intelligent to me .
what kind of a country has this become ? the men wear beads and refuse to fight and the woman adore them . america s days of greatness are over . it has drunk the blue soup .
blue soup ?
an indian narcotic we were forced to drink . it put us in a haze a honey colored haze which was lavender around the edge . we laughed , we sang , we snoozed . when a bird called , we answered back . every living thing was our brother or our sister , we thought . looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long , and we cried . we had a funeral that went on for five days for the cockroach ! i sang oh promise me . can you imagine ? where the hell did i ever learn the words to oh promise me ? looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a b . all the time we were drinking more blue soup , more blue soup ! never stopped drinking blue soup . blue soup all the time . we would go out after food in that honey colored haze , and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender .
sounds quite beautiful .
beautiful , you say ? it was not life , it was not death it was not anything ! beautiful ? seven years gone like that , like that ! seven years of silliness and random dreams ! seven years of nothingness , when there could have been so much !
like what ?
he is a child !
with an iron penis three feet long . load it , boy .
you are begging him to kill you ?
if he thinks he is man enough .
that is really what you want . you become furious when people will not make you dead .
i am teaching my son to be a man .
so he can kill you . you hate your own life that much . you beg for a hero to kill you .
i plan to live one hundred years !
no you do not .
if that is the case that is to prevent my killing myself ?
honor , i suppose .
what a handsome word .
but it is all balled up in your head with death . the highest honor is death . when you talk of these animals , one by one , you do not just talk of killing them . you honored them with death . harold it is not honor to be killed .
if you have lived a good life , fought well
it is still just death , the absence of life no honor at all . it is worse than the blue soup by far that nothingness . to you , though , it is the honor that crowns them all .
the old heroes are going to have to get used to this , harold the new heroes who refuse to fight . they are trying to save the planet . there s no time for battle , no point to battle anymore .
i feel mocked , insulted , with no sort of satisfaction in prospect . we do not have to fight with steel . i can fight with words . i am not an inarticulate ape , you know , who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary . call him up in east st . louis , penelope . tell him to come here .
no .
and my son , the only son of harold ryan he is going to grow up to be a vanisher , too ?
i do not know . i hope he never hunts . i hope he never kills another human being .
i am going to call the police .
this is suicide . go get the police .
no , we will not . no matter how it begins , it will end in death . because it always does . is not that always how it ends , harold in death ?
i am turning off the alarm . i am turning off everything .
ah ! the lady is armed .
i want you to get out of here , norbert . harold i want you to sit down in the chair , and not lift a finger until norbert is gone .
whoever has the gun , you see , gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do . it is the american way .
i mean it !
then you would better fix your bayonet , because there are not any bullets in the gun .
help your mother find the bullet .
how do i load ?
all right ! am i exceedingly dangerous now ?
the national safety council would be appalled .
she is right , norbert go home . woodly i have not said all i have to say .
give me that goddamn thing ! now get out of here , or i might kill you . who knows ?
you have killed women ?
norbert you come , too . let him go , harold . let him go .
of course he can go if he will just go down on his hands and knees for a moment and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree .
ooops .
ooops .
can i uh help you gentlemen ?
gentlemen that is nice .
the door ws unlocked . is it always unlocked ?
it is always locked .
but here you are inside , are not you ?
you are you are old friends of harold ryan ?
we tried to be . we tried to be .
he is dead , you know .
hello ? oh hello , mother .
hello , mother .
. . . who ? . . . did she say how far apart the pains were ? . . . when was that ? . . . oh dear .
oh dear .
look i am sorry i have to go .
we will miss you so .
look this is not my apartment , and there is not anybody else here . mrs . ryan will not be home for a while .
oh , oh , oh i thought it was your apartment . you seemed at home here .
i mean i cannot leave you here . you will have to go . i will tell mrs . ryan you were here . you can come back later .
ahh then she is still alive .
she is fine . please
and still mrs . harold ryan ?
will you please go ? an emergency !
yes ! yes ! the boy ! one boy !
and what , exactly , is your relationship to mrs . ryan ?
neighbor ! doctor ! i live across the hall .
and you come into mrs . ryangs apartment as often as you please , looking into various health matters ?
just her neighbor and doctor ? that is all ?
and her fianc !
and her fianc ! how nice . i hope you will be very happy or is that what one says to the woman ?
you wish the woman good luck , and you tell the man how fortunate he is . that is how it goes .
i have literally got to run !
safe and sound , i see . oh you came back .
how was the emergency , doctor ? profitable , i hope .
a policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab .
tough luck . you will have to split the fee .
are are you crying , penelope ?
i feel the same way . what next ?
what next ? you leave promptly , of course . there is no question as to whose home this is
none .
whose son this is , whose wife that is . a fianc is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time . good night .
ah ! you are ambulatory !
well now what seems to be the trouble with the patient today ? a touch of malaria , perhaps ?
i know malaria . malaria is not caused by the bites of bats .
you have been bitten by bats ?
colonel harper and i once shared a treetop with a family of bats . there was a flash flood . there were piranha fish in the water . that is how colonel harper lost his little toe .
you have chills ?
you can also describe its cure . i am eating its cure .
i was going to ask .
pacqualinincheewa root .
would you say that again ?
pacqualinincheewa root . means cougar fang . cures anything but a yellow streak down the back .
i have never heard of it .
congratulations . by crossing twenty eight feet of cockroach infested carpet , you have become the third white man ever to hear of it .
are you have seen it work cures ?
was not that sweet of me ?
more and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people . curare , ephedrine we have found some amazing things .
we have , have we ?
that is an editorial we , of course . i have not turned up anything personally .
good lord .
i thought she was a widow .
i am going to have to report you to the department of health .
what for ?
it died for your sins .
this little corpse is intended as a lesson ?
there s a certain amount of information there .
this is man to man .
it is healer to killer . is that the same thing ?
what brought you back ?
the same hairy , humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon . honor , if you like .
there s going to be no bloodshed here . i know how he will fight the only way he can fight with words . the truth . am i correct ?
yes .
i can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers . but he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish harold ryan with words . the truth ! correct ?
correct .
what an hallucination ! oh , dear , dear , dear , dear . oh dearie me .
you have not heard me yet .
you intend to crack my eardrums with your voice ? will i bleed from my every orifice ? who will clean up this awful mess ?
you are a filthy , rotten bastard .
oooooo . that hurt .
you are old so old .
now who s being cruel ?
a living fossil ! like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs .
you are a son of a bitch .
i have not told you , harold , how comical i think you are .
hands and knees , you say ?
you are in one hell of a jam . you realize that ?
i am high as a kite .
glands . you are supposed to be happy when you die . call me comical again .
you are a clown . you are a clown who kills but you are a clown .
i love you ! have a cigar !
evolution has made you a clown with a cigar . simple butchers like you are obsolete !
i am to be left behind in primordial ooze ?
if you are at home in the ooze , and nowhere else .
this is going to become very physical . are you prepared for that ?
you are not such a creature of the ooze that you would hurt an unarmed man .
i am an honorable clown ?
king arthur .
you hope .
in any event , i will not beg for mercy .
no quarter asked . no quarter given .
do not you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew ?
cut me open . find out .
i have struck my blow .
with spittle ?
i have poisoned you . harold lucretia borgia ? something i drank or touched ? you refused a cigar . that is it ! potassium cyanide in the humidor ! treacherous lover of peace !
i put a poisoned thought in your head . even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind . it is saying , obsolete , obsolete , obsolete , and , clown , clown , clown .
poison .
you have a very good mind , or i would not have come back . that mind is now asking itself , cleverly and fairly , is harold ryan really a clown ? and the answer is , yes .
i i really must congratulate you . something is happening in there .
you can never take yourself seriously again ! look at all the creatures you have protected us from ! did you shoot them on the elevator , as they were on their way up here to eat us alive ?
no . woodly the magic root you gave me i had it analyzed . it was discovered by a harvard botanist in ! he explored your famous jungle for five years , armed with nothing but kindness , a talent for languages , and a pocketknife .
i see .
you are not going to hurt me . you are not going to hurt anybody any more . any violent gesture will seem ridiculous to yourself !
don quixote .
my violin is avenged !
something seems to have happened to my self respect .
and the hell with it . it was so tragically irrelevant , so preposterously misinformed .
the new hero is you .
i hate crowds , and i have no charisma
you are too modest .
but the new hero will be a man of science and of peace like me . he will disarm you , of course . no more guns , no more guns .
was i ever of use ?
here . finish the job .
i am utterly satisfied .
you are making a mistake . obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded . you have wounded me .
more clowning ! do not you see ?
we never quit fighting until we are dead .
you would be killing a friend . do not you know how much i like you ?
i am going to shoot you now .
no !
my self respect is gone and my soldier s honor with it . it is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man .
new dignity can be yours as a merciful man . you can change !
like the saber toothed tiger .
oh god you are really going to kill me . harold it will not hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee . heaven is very much like paradise , they say . you will like it there .
can i beg for mercy on my knees ?
if you want to be found that way .
what is this thing that kills me ?
man , as man was meant to be a vengeful ape who murders . he will soon be extinct . it is time , it is time .
do not shoot .
no . no .
get up .
no .
cannot do it .
thank you for my life .
it is trash now , like mine .
new lives begin !
somewhere in this city . not here , not here . tell penelope i loved her in my clownish way . and paul . tell him to be a healer , by all means .
what are you going to do ?
use the sanitary facilities , if i may .
leave the rifle here .
i will put it in paul s room , where it belongs .
give me your word of honor that that is all you are going to do .
jesus i dunno . you know . what the heck . who knows ?
colonel harper , retired now , dropped an atom bomb on nagasaki during the second world war , killing seventy four thousand people in a flash .
i dunno , boy .
you do not know ?
it was a bitch .
and you went home unannounced , too ?
alice got married again .
she did ?
you did not even find that out ?
there was so much going on .
she married an accountant named stanley kestenbaum .
dead !
jesus .
alice is dead ?
no , no shit no . excuse me , penelope .
for what ?
for saying shit . or is that okay now ?
who s dead ?
my mother in law . fire engines , pulmotors , doctors , cops , coroners
what happened ?
well i walked up to the front door . i was still alive . big surprise . i rang the doorbell , and old mrs . wheeler answered . she had her goddamn knitting . i said , guess who ? she conked right out .
how horrible .
and you , colonel ? let me guess you do not know .
so long , you guys .
what will you do , colonel ?
mr . ryan just borrowed my birthday cake . i do not really know him .
thought you were another wife , maybe .
i am only ten years old .
that is what he wanted a ten year old wife . he would come home from a war or a safari , and he would wind up talking to the little kids .
will not you please join our club ? please ?
aha ! hello ! you are mildred , right ?
i heard you were looking for me .
you were harold ryangs third wife . right ?
yes .
you want to join the harold ryan fan club ? wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back ?
because he was cruel ?
premature ejaculation .
ach soooooooooo . mildred no grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation . harold would come home trumpeting and roaring . he would the kick the furniture with his boots , spit into corners and the fireplace . he would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them . he would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him , and he would tear off my clothes . he would carry me into the bedroom , telling me to scream and kick my feet . that was very important to him . i did it . i tried to be a good wife . he told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo . i could not do that , but i pretended i did . it was all over ten seconds after he would said the word buffalo . then he would zip up his pants , and go outside , and tell true war stories to the little kids . any little kids .
that is sad .
is it ? i have this theory about why men kill each other and break things .
ja ?
she is my date tonight . what do you want her to do bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump ? bugger off ! ask paul what he thinks . your mother looks beautiful right ? kid ? does not your mother look nice ? paul ?
i do not care what she wears .
something s made you sore .
do not worry about it .
you bet i will worry about it . i said something wrong ?
it is my father s birthday that is all . that is all . who cares about that ?
i had not the slightest inkling . why did not you say so ?
she does not care ! she is not married any more ! she is going to have fun ! i hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it . dr . woodly i hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you have said so far .
kid kid
and i wish you would quit touching me all the time . it drives me nuts !
that is this ?
do not !
you sure misunderstood something and we would better get it straight .
do not touch me . get out of the way .
i worship your father . that stuffed alligator your mother gave me the one he shot ? it is the proudest thing in my apartment .
thank god !
that goes double for me .
i do not want to live any more .
i feel like i want to yell my head off just yell anything . bulllllllllllllll dickey !
i will kill myself .
do not touch me .
would not you rather have your mother marry me than him ?
no .
and this is my son , paul . he was only four years old when his father disappeared .
he is coming back , mom ! he is the bravest , most wonderful man who ever lived .
i told you this was a simple minded play .
maybe he will come back tonight ! it is his birthday .
i know .
stay home tonight !
oh , paul
you are married ! you have already got a husband !
he is a ghost !
he is alive !
not even mutual of omaha thinks so anymore .
if you have to go out with some guy cannot he be more like dad ? herb shuttle and norbert woodly cannot you do better than those two freaks ?
thank you , kind sir .
a vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor .
a what kind of doctor ?
a fairy a queer . everybody in the building knows he is a queer .
that is an interesting piece of news .
you are the only woman he ever took out .
not true .
still lives with his mother .
you know she has no feet ! you want him to abandon his mother , who has no husband , who has no money of her own , who has no feet ?
how did she lose her feet ?
in a railroad accident many years ago .
i was afraid to ask .
norbert was just beginning practice . a real man would have sold her to a catfood company , i suppose . as far as that goes , j . edgar hoover still lives with his mother .
i did not know that .
a lot of people do not .
j . edgar hoover plays sports .
i do not really know .
i hate that thing .
where will you be ?
are you and dr . woodly engaged ?
who have you been talking to ?
yes , he is .
is norbert still here ?
no .
then who flushed the toilet ?
father s friend .
that is his name ?
do not know .
mom ?
that man is your father .
what ?
there stands the loins from which you have sprung .
i do not get it .
that is why i am crying .
what are his symptoms ?
shivers and sweats and groans . his teeth chatter . what will we do ?
what does he say to do ?
really ?
it is an emergency , is not it ?
yeah .
then get him .
peace , everybody paul , penelope .
you are taking mom out tonight ?
we do not have a maid any more .
everything stays as it is !
a monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat .
my father !
i apologize . but you did not know him , and neither did i . how is your asthma ?
do not worry about it .
how is the fungus around your thumbnail ?
it is fine !
i hate that thing .
it came yesterday . i have not opened it yet .
i did not get his name . a friend of your father ?
he is not any friend of father .
he is not ?
he is my father .
please
he is not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom .
i keep having this nightmare that he catches us .
doing what ?
he would kill me . he would be right to kill me , too the kind of guy he is .
or was . we have not done anything wrong , you know .
he would assume we had .
that is something i suppose .
all through the day i am so confident . that is why i am such a good salesman , you know ? i have confidence , and i look like i have confidence , and that gives other people confidence . people laugh sometimes when they find out i am a vacuum cleaner salesman . they stop laughing , though , when they find out i made forty three thousand dollars last year . i have got six other salesmen working under me , and what they all plug into is my confidence . that is what charges them up .
i am glad .
i was captain of the wrestling team at lehigh university .
i know .
if you want to wrestle , you got lehigh . if you want to play tennis , you go to vanderbilt .
i do not want to go to vanderbilt .
yes ?
something happens to my confidence .
this conversation took place , incidentally , about three months before harold was declared legally dead .
when harold is definitely out of the picture , penelope , when i do not have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or paul wrong . i am going to ask you to be my wife .
i am touched .
that is when i will get my confidence back .
i see .
if you will pardon the expression , that is when you will see the fur and feathers fly . good night .
coming .
gentlemen ! is this right for a fight ? it is been so long .
beautiful ! i have never seen that coat .
what then ?
did you see him ?
yeah .
is he all right ?
far as i know .
is he coming home ?
he ditched me . he started running , and i started running , then he lost me in the park .
the park !
it is dark in there . penelope and that is where he is !
i figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another .
you figure !
then i saw this bakery store that was still open , so i bought a birthday cake .
a what ?
for harold . when paul comes home , we can have some birthday cake .
how nice .
did you talk to paul ?
before he started to run . he said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck and someday we would all hear the sound of that key in the door .
we have got to find him . i want you to show me exactly where you saw him last . and you stay here , norbert , in case he comes home . that is all he said the thing about the key ?
he said one other thing . it was not very nice .
what was it ?
that is the matter now ?
possibly .
how long has this been going on ?
a week . we were waiting for the right time to
i feel as though i had been made a perfect chump of .
i am sorry .
marry me instead .
thank you , herb . you are a wonderful man . you really are . everybody respects you for what you have done for scouting and the little league .
you are saying no .
i am saying no and thank you .
i did not make my move fast enough . that is it , is not it ? i was too respectful .
you were wonderful .
it is true .
you and harold are friends ?
i am dr . norbert woodly a physician , a healer . i find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society . gentleness must replace violence everywhere , or we are doomed .
herb shuttle is taking me to a fight .
take plenty of cigars .
we made the date three months ago .
i must take you to an emergency ward sometime on a saturday night . that is also fun . i came to see selma , as a matter of fact .
the animals made her sneeze and cry too much .
i am glad somebody finally cried . every time i come in here and see all this unnecessary death , i want to cry . i do not cry , of course . not manly , you know . did she try antihistamines ?
they made her so sleepy she could not work .
war is not healthy for children and other living things . how lovely .
oh no ! wear a coat of cotton wear a coat of wool .
what ?
i never knew when to hold it or who to ask , or what to say .
this is very good for us .
it is ?
the wilder paul is tonight , the calmer he will be tomorrow .
as long as he keeps out of the park .
after this explosion , i think , he will be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again .
the only thing i ever told him about life was , keep out of the park after the sun goes down .
we have got to dump shuttle . he brings his vacuum cleaner on dates ?
that is the xke .
the what ?
it is an experimental model . he does not dare leave it in his car , for fear it will fall into the hands of competition .
what kind of a life is that ?
he told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was . he made eagle scout when he was twenty nine years old . oh , norbert promise me that paul has not gone into the park !
if you warned him against it as much as you say , it is almost a certainty .
no ! oh no ! three people murdered in there in the last six weeks ! the police will not even go in there any more .
i wish paul luck .
it is suicide !
i would be dead by now if that were the case .
meaning ?
every night , penelope , for the past two years , i have made it a point to walk through the park at midnight .
why would you do that ?
to show myself how brave i am . the issue s in doubt , you know since i am always for peace
i am amazed .
me , too . i know something not even the police know that is in the park at midnight . nothing . or , when i am in there , there s me in there . fear and nobody and me .
and maybe paul . what about the murderers ? they are in there !
they did not murder me .
paul s only twelve years old .
he can make the sound of human footsteps which is a terrifying sound .
we have got to rescue him .
if he is in the park , luck is all that can save him now , and there s plenty of that .
he is not your son .
no . but he is going to be . if he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side , i can say to him , you and i are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight . on that we can build .
it is a jungle out there .
that is been said before .
you know each other ?
we met here earlier this evening .
thank you . thank you very much .
i am taking her to the airport a few minutes from now . she is going to east st . louis to visit an aunt .
tell her to have a nice trip .
get out of here .
you fool , you fool .
everything s going to be beautiful .
do it !
hi kid . would you look what the car dragged in .
i am glad you brought your vacuum cleaner .
is that a fact ?
you have got to fight from time to time .
not true .
or get eaten alive .
that is not true either or need not be , unless we make it true .
phooey .
we simply stop doing that dropping things on each other , eating each other alive .
the late mrs . harold ryan .
i am sick of this argument . i just have one more thing to say if you elect a president , you support him , no matter what he does . that is the only way you can have a country !
it is the planet that is in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon .
none of my relatives are chinese communists . speak for yourself .
chinese maniacs and russian maniacs and american maniacs and french maniacs and british maniacs have turned this lovely , moist , nourishing blue green ball into a doomsday device . let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile , and that is the end of mankind .
start with the smallest weights . every week add a pound or two .
maybe god has let everybody who ever lived be reborn so he or she can see how it ends . even pithecanthropus erectus and australopithecus and sinanthropus pekensis and the neanderthalers are back on earth to see how it ends . they are all on times square making change for peepshows . or recruiting marines .
you ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day ?
he died of a massive rupture .
you think you are so funny . you are not even funny . right ? right ? you do not hurt yourself if you start out slow .
kid kid
it is good . let him go .
if he would just come out for the little league , the way i asked him , he would find out we touch all the time shove each other , slug each other , and just horse around . i am going to go get him
if he would just get into scouting , and camp out some , and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire
what a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage .
minors are not allowed at fights .
happy birthday , wanda june !
we have this new club up here in heaven .
yes , we do .
we only have two members so far , but it is growing all the time .
we have enough for a shuffleboard team . in heaven , shuffleboard is everything . hitler plays shuffleboard .
albert einstein plays shuffleboard .
mozart plays shuffleboard .
lewis carroll , who wrote alice in wonderland , plays shuffleboard .
jack the ripper plays shuffleboard .
walt disney , who gave us snow white and the seven dwarfs , plays shuffleboard . jesus christ plays shuffleboard .
it was almost worth the trip to find out that jesus christ in heaven was just another guy , playing shuffleboard . i like his sense of humor , though you know ? he is got a blue and gold warm up jacket he wears . you know what it says on the back ? pontius pilate athletic club . most people do not get it . most people think there really is a pontius pilate athletic club .
we are going to have jackets , are not we ?
hello . my name is beatrice . have you been here before ?
no .
what we offer here is nude body to body contact on a bed in a private room . it is twenty dollars a half hour , thirty dollars an hour . anything else you desire may be discussed in the privacy of your room . tips are allowed . we accept bank americard , master charge and american express .
i do not really want . . . body to body contact .
no . i do not think so .
you are not exactly the type we are looking for .
you mean i am black ?
no , just not the type .
what do you mean , not the type ? do not you know who i am ? i am big dick brown ! i have been in more porno movies than you ever saw . i have worked with harry reems . i have worked with johnny wad . not the type ! i can come ten times a day . i can keep it hard two hours at a time . my cock is nine inches long .
i am sorry , mr . brown . i am sure you are very good , but at the moment , i have got nothing for you . if something comes up , we will give you a call .
the boy your daughter was talking to did not work at the park . we have interviewed everybody there .
but is she , has . . .
there s no evidence of any foul play at present . i hope she is just a runaway .
there s something wrong here . kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave .
i said i hope she is a runaway . better that than she just disappears like so many others do . sometimes they turn up years later , sometimes not . a lot of crimes go unreported , unknown . these are realities .
what are you doing ?
apparently your friend has gone into mexico . a border guard responded to the apb . how does it feel to have the l . a . p . d . doing your work for you ?
you are going to thank me for this . you know what the media s like . they love this kinda shit . if that guy goes off half cocked and gets himself hurt , you are going to have so much bad publicity , you . . .
i heard you the first time . we had nothing to go on with this kid . just a runaway . do you really think he is in danger ?
if he has anything to say about it , yeah . i have been asking a lot of questions and i do not like the answers i am getting . he is made a lot of people nervous , including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star .
we are not gonna arrest him for that . . .
big threat . tv would ream you .
no .
we offer female wrestling , that is , nude body to body contact , with a girl of your choice in a private room . twenty dollars a half hour , thirty dollars hour . any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room . tipping is permitted . we accept bank americard , master charge and american express .
yeah .
do you want to take a session ?
i just want to ask some questions .
you may do that in the privacy of your room .
okay . i will take a half hour .
do you have any particular choice of girl ?
you are still dressed ?
well , i want to . . .
there s a girl i want to ask you about .
you are not vice , are you ? do you work for the los angeles police department , or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency ?
no , i do not .
well , actually i wanted to ask about this girl . i have her picture here .
pull out your cock .
what ?
no , felice , i am not a cop . in fact , right now i have got as little respect for the police as you do . i am looking for a girl . a runaway . i need someone to help me .
are you going to stiff me ?
what do you mean ?
look , that twenty dollars you just paid , i do not get any of that . that goes to the guys that own this place . i get two bucks an hour , minus ten percent for a bail fund . i make all my money on tips .
you want a tip ?
sure . what do you want ? tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars .
what do you mean ?
what do you want to tip me for ? look , you got to spell it out . whatever you want , just say it .
now , what do you want ?
i said i just wanted to talk to you . . .
that is cool .
. . . about this woman . i am trying to find her . do you know her ?
i am getting angry .
wait a minute , that is going to cost you more than forty bucks .
who is it ? that blond guy ? where is he ? i am going to talk to someone .
wait ?
i would like to place a personals ad in the free press .
how many weeks ?
just one .
film producer that should be in caps , bold face .
okay .
hello . you want some information ?
yeah .
we offer . . .
yeah , yeah . . .
. . . the disciplines bondage , domination and humiliation .
i am looking for tod . is he in ?
i do not know no tod .
what girls you got here ?
my name is hope . this is faith . charity s in back .
that is all you got , three girls ?
man , how many girls do you need ?
i was told there was a real nice girl here named joanne . quite young .
is this all the display space we can get ?
what do you think of this . . . ah , shade of blue , mary .
i like it , mr . van dorn .
do not you think it is a little too . . . bright ?
not really . but if you want me to tone it down . . .
no , that would be much too overpowering .
yeah , overpowering . that was the word i was looking for .
mr . van dorn , i have worked on the color scheme for weeks . i think it is just right .
that is that shade of blue called ?
are you still going with that fella that teaches at grand valley ?
sam ?
yeah . he is a nice guy . do not lose him . maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit . it is a little . . .
overpowering ?
yeah .
okay , mr . van dorn , i think we could knock that pavonine blue a bit .
are you sure it is all right ?
yes . i think it will look better .
kristen went on that convention today , did not she ?
are you the star of this picture ?
you kidding ? three days work . i finish tonight .
the other girl is the star ?
she thinks so . what do you do ?
i work with ramada . we are doing some pictures together .
are you niki ?
sure . like in mikey and niki . did you see that picture ?
no .
it is your money . you talk .
i am making a film . jim sullivangs going to be in it . he said you might know where tod is .
do i know you ? were not you on the set the other night ? with ramada .
yeah .
you making a feature ?
um hm . live sound .
joanne ?
you know her ?
no . i saw her with tod .
do you know where she lives ?
nah .
where is she ?
tod might know .
where is he ?
last i heard he went to san diego .
if we went there , would you be able to find him ?
you are not a film producer , are you ?
are you a private detective ?
something like that . how much do you make ?
here ? what a joke . there was some detective asking about that girl .
three hundred ?
this is just temporary . i once made nine hundred in outcall .
i will give you a week , cash , if you help me find this girl .
up front ?
half now , half later .
make it nine hundred . that was my best week .
okay . my client pays for it anyway .
when do we start ?
tonight . when you get out , we will go . why did not you tell the other detective ?
i thought you were going to bed ?
no .
huh ?
you have anything to drink ? you want to go out and get something ?
i do not drink , but you can go out .
you do not drink ?
you are not a private detective either , are you ?
no .
i did not think so . i have fucked detectives . who are you ?
a friend .
of joanne s ?
yeah . i am her father .
jesus .
her name is kristen . she disappeared a couple of months ago .
and your wife ? where is she ?
she is dead .
you really should not eat like that . all that sugar . it is not good for you .
at least i am a growing person .
you will not keep growing at this rate .
what rate ?
you know what i am talking about .
you never met a working girl before , have you ? you think i like sucking off guys all night ? maybe i do . so what ? you cannot even say it , can you ?
say what ?
sucking off .
okay . sucking off . now does that make me as good as you ?
you do not understand shit .
okay , tell me . why do you live like you do ?
did you ever live in a room with six people and you did not have any money , any food , any furniture ? have your brother come out , his car break down , he cannot get a job ? your friends stealing food , going through trash behind a supermarket ?
is that the way it was with you ?
do not knock it . a girl can save up a lot money doing this big money . then you are free . you can go off to europe , meet somebody , get married . my girlfriend s going to buy her own beauty parlor . not me . i am gonna travel . keep moving that is my motto . would you rather work at copper penny at a dollar eighty an hour , having every two bit cocksucker able to yell at you ? i can make more money suc . . . doing what i do for five minutes than i can all week at another job .
you used to work at copper penny ?
no .
you and i , niki , have very different ideas about sex .
why ? are you a sex fiend ?
no .
neither am i .
but it is all you do .
how important do you think sex is ?
not very .
i do not see why i must justify myself to you . i do not care about the things you do . i do not care that is happening in new york or los angeles . i do not care about movies or tv . i do not care who s on johnny carson .
what do you care about ?
that is t j ?
tijuana .
they were here ?
tod was . he was with ratan .
what does that mean ? what does he do ?
he deals in pain .
you have to believe in something . what do they believe in the whatjamacillit church ?
christian reformed . it is a dutch calvinist denomination .
do they believe in reincarnation ? i believe in reincarnation .
they believe in the tulip .
what the crap ?
it is an anagram . it comes from the canons of dort . every letter stands for a different belief . t u l i p . like are you sure you are interested in this ?
yeah , yeah , go on .
t stands for total depravity , that is , all men , through original sin , are totally evil and incapable of good . all my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the lord .
be that as it may . u is for unconditional election . god has chosen a certain number of people to be saved , the elect , and he has chosen them from the beginning of time . l is for limited atonement . only a limited number will be atoned , will go to heaven .
fuck .
i can stop if you want .
i is for irresistible grace . god s grace cannot be resisted or denied . and p is for the perseverance of the saints . once you are in grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect . and that is the tulip .
wait , wait . i am trying to figure this out . this is like rona barrett . before you become saved , god already knows who you are ?
he has to . that is predestination . if god is omniscient , if he knows everything and he would not be god if he did not then he must have known , even before the creation of the world , the names of those who would be saved .
so it is already worked out . the fix is in ?
more or less .
wow . then why be good ? either you are saved or you ai not .
out of gratitude for being chosen . that is where grace comes in . god first chooses you , then allows you , by grace , to choose him of your own free will .
you really believe all that ?
yeah . well , mostly .
i thought i was fucked up .
i will admit it is confusing from the outside . you have got to see it from the inside .
if you see anything from the inside it makes sense . you ought to hear perverts talk . a guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me .
it is not quite the same thing .
tod will meet you at the bookstore at eddy and o farrell tomorrow noon . i told him you were a specialty customer .
rot in hell , honey . he is busy now .
where does he live .
i must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life . at least it feels that way .
i know what you mean . after a while they all look the same .
they are the same .
do you live in a house back in wherever .
grand rapids ? of course .
look , i really do not know your daughter but . . .
but what ?
i would not expect too much . i mean about her coming back . once a girl gets into the life .
what makes you so sure ?
why do you say that ?
she left you right ?
yeah . she was the one called joanne . how would you find that out ?
i do not blame you , niki . really i do not . it is this culture , where everything s based on sex , sold on sex . . . . . . magazines , music , tv . it is destroying everything . buy this cause of sex , use this cause of sex . kids think it is normal . they think they are supposed to talk dirty , wear scanty clothes . . .
do not get upset . i lied too . i do not make no five hundred dollars a week . everything i make goes to granville .
granville ?
look , niki , this really is not my business . i do not know anything about . . .
did you find out where she was ?
tod gave me the slip . i have to find him again . where does he live ?
what happened ?
where is he ?
listen , niki . my daughter s been missing five months . i have gone through a lot to find out that is happened to her . i just saw a girl killed . i will not let tod slip out of my hands . you have to tell me where he is .
but then you will forget about me .
those cops , like all cops , are intelligent enough , but they are masters of de ductive reason . that is , you ask them what three and two are they will tell you five , but if you ask them what five is , they go blank . that is spec u lative reasoning , and that is where i come in .
well , what do they know ?
dogshit . worse yet , they do not care .
so then , mr . mast . . .
andy .
. . . what do you have to offer ?
no , i did not think she was . let me get the picture here . let me guess . she was an absolutely clean girl , a model daughter , she never had rebellious or impure thoughts , she did not fuck around . . .
if i was you , mr . mast , i would watch my language .
hey , i am a private detective , van dorn , you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to grand rapids . i have been to that scumbag town . it is full of them .
who s paying you ?
you are .
that is right .
as i was saying , i will pick up the thread . there s a number of ways i can go . there s not much you can do here . stay if you want . maybe it would be better if you went back home . go through kristengs personal stuff . ask around , maybe she knew somebody out here . look , i do this a lot . i work at a minimum rate of . a week . it may seem like a lot of money to you , but it ai not . you could hire cheaper .
and better ?
hello ?
mr . van dorn ?
mast ?
yeah .
where are you ? the connection sounds very good .
i am back in grand rapids .
in g . r . ? why ?
can you meet me in about an hour ? at the pantlind hotel ?
i have got a meeting . . .
what are you paying me for ?
this used to be a real city . i was here about fifteen years ago . embezzlement case . it was always a little religious for my taste , but at least it was a city . with a downtown and all .
what have you found out ?
i have got some news . your daughter s all right . at least i think she is .
where is she ?
i do not know .
what do you mean ?
have you ever seen any , ah , pornographic movies , jake ?
no .
do you know what a hardcore movie is ?
that is like a stag film .
yeah . you ever seen any of those ?
no .
they are legal now .
they are ?
yeah . all over . even here in grand rapids .
hmm .
where is she ?
i do not know .
i bought it at a store in l . a .
who made it ?
i do not know .
wait . slow down . a film like this , mm , cost two three hundred dollars , sold outright , shown in peep machines , maybe theatres , maybe not , is almost impossible to track . nobody makes it nobody shows it nobody sees it . it is like it does not even exist .
that is it called ?
it was called slave of love when i bought it . next time it is sold , it will be called something else .
but the police . . .
the police ? they know less than you do .
do you think she is safe ?
yeah . probably .
you like this , do not you . showing me . . . this .
i ai not cheated you , pilgrim . this is research , damn it ! that girl could have told us something .
oh , fuck off . you should stay where you belong .
i am only human , you know .
get out .
but this is my apartment .
what are you doing here ?
i felt like such a shit , pilgrim , after what i did to you not that i did anything wrong that i kept investigating , poking around . there s some poor s . o . b . in l . a . with his face all bent out of shape who you have damaged his movie career . lucky for him , people do not look at his face .
do the police want to arrest me ?
nah . they do not care about some faggot hustler . they are more interested in your daughter s health and yours . like i am .
yeah , sure .
listen , pilgrim , you are way out on a limb here . you do not know what you are into .
you sure as hell have not been any help .
i am sorry about that . have you found anything out ? you have got to tell me .
why do not you tell me something for a change ?
like what ?
where would you hear that name ?
you know , it is possible to buy anything on this earth . you can buy child whores , slaves . you can have people raped , killed . . . one of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named ratan . he usually is not in this country . how would you hear about him ?
it is just a name .
do not do anything more . i will find out what i can .
does she know anything about this ?
what happened , pilgrim ?
just leave me alone .
andy , can you do something for her ? maybe money . . .
you want to go for coffee after we send the girls off ?
no . thanks anyway . i have got to get over to the office .
what is it , jake ?
what happened ?
is marsha there ?
yeah . she is quite upset . i am going to fly out today . they want me to bring some pictures .
how is your business , jake ?
pretty good .
jake ?
how did you find me ?
wes , do me a favor .
what ?
just do what i say . do not ask .
what is going on ?
i think i have found a way to find kristen . i have a plan . but i have to be alone .
what plan ?
you do not want to know . now , wes , leave , please . for me .
what will i tell the others ? they care about you .
hey man .
we are casting for an explicit sex action feature . . .
i know . word s out on the street word s also out you ai not really hiring anyone .
that is not true , mr . . . ?
jim sullivan . sometimes they call me jism jim .
oh yeah ? i have done a lot of good stuff . shorts , features . no major roles it is true . but good stuff .
oh yeah ? i remember that . it was made by some college kids .
it was called slave of love .
god , i do not know what it was called . i never saw it . i only got twenty five bucks for the whole goddamned thing .
hey , stop , stop . i will do anything you want . it is okay . i can dig it . you can do anything you want to me .
where is she ? where is the girl ?
she is got a man . a white guy . tod something or other .
where does he hang out ?
i do not know .
where !
i hear you got money to spend . i hear you are interested in . . . interesting things .
yeah .
do you work for the san francisco police department , or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency ?
no .
what you got in mind ?
i want to meet ratan .
what is that ? a kind of chair ? i never heard of no ratan .
i was told that there were certain things that only ratan could provide .
you are talking about real excitement ?
yeah . i heard you and ratan just came from mexico . and that you had a film of a girl being , ah you know . . .
who told you about this ?
rucker .
i do not know no ratan , but i may be able to help you out . it is not me , of course . just helping out a friend . it will cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening .
is this with a girl named kristen ?
um hm . you got the five hundred ?
well . . .
take it or leave it .
okay .
meet me here today at seven o clock . with the money . then we will go see the film .
what do you want ? do i know you from somewhere ?
i want to know where my daughter is . her name is kristen , or joanne . she is with you .
you wait here . i will find out where she is .
where is ratan ?
that film was a fake ! everything s phony . . .
who the fuck knows ? the four aces . he goes there .
fifty cents admission .
what ?
do you have a , ah , film called slave of love ?
what we got is just these here . what you see .
it is a short film .
this is from the movie i was talking about .
i do not know what you are talking about .
i wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman . . . . . . right here .
that girl ? no , never saw her . i do not know anybody .
i am just trying to find . . . who owns this store ?
i do not know . look , man , if you are looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops .
but i . . .
you do not want anything for your fifty cents ?
here . take your fifty cents back .
that is all right .
no . i walked up . do not ride elevators .
my secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition .
yes . i am interested in financing an adult feature film . i was told you were the man to come to .
i have got fifty thousand dollars to invest .
oh . why is it that you want to get into film financing ?
well , bill mind if i call you bill ? let me be frank . i have made a lot of money . i have got my own business in detroit . rivets . i make rivets and sell them to fisher body . well , rivets , you know , can get pretty boring after a while . when my business manager told me i should shelter some money , i thought i would try this .
what exactly do you have in mind ?
i thought i would invest in a film . i want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film , meet the people who make films , learn how it is done . . .
in other words , you want to get laid ?
not exactly . . .
it is cool . why do you think i got in the movies ? how much poon do you think you get in the car wash business ? look , fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy . you can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars . so why fuck with the movie business ?
it is an investment .
if you want to watch when we shoot a film , for fifty bucks , i let guys stand around and watch . it is a lot cheaper .
i thought you were a businessman .
do not get me wrong . a couple years ago , i woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing . but the lord s been good to me . i can now finance any films i choose . big ones , small ones . right now we are setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film . live sound . i like to keep my own money in my films . that way you do not have to share the profits . there s plenty of guys in town that will take it , though . but if i was you , mr . . . what was your name again ?
jake .
. . . i would just start my own business . that is what i did . get into kid porn . that is big now . why do not you come around the set ? meet some people . if you still want to invest , i will ask around .
sounds all right .
i got a picture here . i want you to tell me where to find this woman . i been asking everybody . nobody knows anything .
calm down , mister . you do not want to get the cops in here do you ? you got a family ?
i do not suppose you have ever seen this girl before either ? her name s kristen , but i suppose you have never seen her ?
why do not you just go outdoors , mister ? cool off .
hold it , mister .
you going to knott s berry farm with him ?
he asked me . you going with anybody ?
i do not know .
you ever play chicken ?
that is that ?
you never heard of that ?
com on , tell me .
what does that do ?
ssh . i am on a stakeout .
i am staking out this beer bottle . trying to find out if i will finish it or it will finish me .
i am worried about jake .
i am off that case . he fired me .
he did not look good at all . something strange is going on . he is got himself into some trouble . he would not say what .
i want to rehire you . to find out that is happening to my brother in law .
i have been on another case . all day . i suppose i can move it over . seven fifty a week , plus travel expenses .
maybe . maybe not .
i also want you to protect my brother in law .
huh ?
you have to understand . he can be mean , self righteous . he had a vishund once . loved that dog . he came home one day and the dog bit him . he took that dog and staked him out in the back yard . it was winter . every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze . he is capable of doing anything .
to his own daughter ?
you know granville s looking for you , niki ?
my name ai not niki . it is pattica , like in attica .
granville s looking for you anyway .
who s that ?
the guy who bought you that ring .
you can fuck off , too .
you are taking a big chance .
i ai not ever gonna see him again anyway .
jake will take care of me .
hey , piss head , what brings you around ?
you do not have to get uppity with me , bill . i remember when you was running that car wash and could not make it go . and what was that other thing you tried ? a dairy queen ? went busted too .
i want you to take a look at this girl here . she is been in some porn stuff .
no , andy . do not know the kid .
look again , billy boy . this is jail bait . could get you in a lotta trouble .
you remember me . louise ? rhymes with squeeze .
you working in san diego now ?
i am still in l . a . , but i am looking for tod . i heard he was around .
was . he and that shitheel ratan went down to t j . maybe i should not say that . anyway , i hear he is back in frisco now .
was he with a girl ?
no .
hello , i am candy gulf .
you are at the university , candy ?
yes , i am .
and what are you studying ?
poli . sci . with a home ec minor .
eh , poli sci ?
he seems very nice . is harold interested in , eh , that is going on ? i think it is such a super thing to study . and then , of course , i can always fall back on home ec .
i think i should mention , candy , that harold does have his eccentric moments .
lady , you were going miles an hour in a mile zone . could i see your license , please ?
yes . those little pieces of paper with your picture on it ?
yes .
oh , i do not have one .
come again .
i do not have one . i do not believe in them .
how long have you been driving ?
about forty five minutes , would not you say , harold ? we were hoping to start sooner but , you see , it is rather hard to find a truck .
could i see your registration ?
i just do not think we have one , unless it is in the glove compartment . could you look , harold ?
is not this your vehicle ?
no , no . i just took it .
took it ?
yes . you see i have to plant my tree .
your tree .
well , it is not really mine . i dug it up in front of the courthouse . we are transplanting it . letting it breathe , you know . but , of course , we would like to get it into soil , as soon as possible .
lady , let me get this straight .
okay , lady . out .
have not we met before ?
none of that , lady .
oh , well . must have been your brother .
but there is a family resemblance .
you too , buster . stand over here . lady , you are in a heap of trouble . i have you down here for several violations speeding , resisting arrest , driving without a license , driving a stolen vehicle , possession of a stolen tree . . . where is the tree ?
we planted it .
is this your shovel ?
no .
possession of a stolen shovel .
officer , i can explain .
lady , resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense . under the state criminal code , section , paragraph b . . .
oh , do not get officious . you are not yourself when you are officious . that is the curse of a government job .
lady , is it true you are driving without a license ?
check .
and that truck is it registered in your name ?
oh no ! not in u my u name .
then whose name is it registered in ?
well , i do not know . do you know , harold ?
where are the papers ?
i suppose they are in the truck . are you going to take a lot of time with this ?
wait here .
because if you are . . .
this way , edith . harold is out by the garage . he has a new car and he has been tuning it up . he is very mechanical .
oh . it looks like a hearse . very nice . compact .
edith , i would like you to meet my son , harold . harold , this is edith . . . eh ?
and what do you do , my dear ?
i am a file clerk harrison feed and grain .
how interesting .
not very .
oh . well , what is it exactly that you do ?
edith was just telling me about her job .
i am a file clerk .
yes . henderson feed and grain .
harrison . harrison feed and grain . . . at hamilton and fourth . . . i am in charge of the invoices . . . and i type up the schedule for the trucking fleet . . .
she supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed .
what do you want ?
sorry i am late .
a rather free translation but nonetheless correct . greetings to you too , my little one . tell me , what do you see ?
a block of ice .
exactly ! now , ask me what i see .
what do you see ?
here s your shovel .
eh , no . thank you .
you are welcome . did you know him ?
eh , no .
me neither . i heard he was eighty years old . i will be eighty next week . a good time to move on , do not you think ?
i do not know .
it is a question of emphasis , you might say . accentuate the positive , so to speak .
eh , could i have my pen back now , please ?
oh , of course . what is your name ?
harold chasen .
how do you do ? i am dame marjorie chardin , but you may call me maude .
nice to meet you .
can i drop you anywhere , harold ?
no , thank you . i have my car .
do you dance ?
what ?
do you sing and dance ?
eh , no .
yes .
oh , so do i . they are such fun , are not they ? it is all change . all revolving . burials and births . the end to the beginning and the beginning to the end the great circle of life . my , this old thing handles well . ever drive a hearse , harold ?
yes .
well , it is a new experience for me . good on curves . shall i take you home , harold ?
but this is my car .
your hearse ?
yearse !
of course , i have had to make some additions for the new models , but not as many as you might think . once you have your basic set it is then only a question of variation .
and you get into any car you want and just drive off ?
not u any u car . i like to keep a variety . i am always looking for the new experience , like this one . i liked it .
thank you . but when you take these cars do not you think you are wronging the owners ?
what owners , harold ? we do not u own u anything . it is a transitory world . we come on the earth with nothing , and we go out with nothing , so is not ownership a little absurd ?
still , i think you would upset people and i am not sure that is right .
it is all memorabilia , but incidental and not integral , if you know what i mean .
it is very interesting .
she is very sweet , but so old fashioned . please sit down , harold . i will put on the kettle and we will have a nice hot cup of tea .
thank you , but i really have to go .
but it is oat straw tea . you have never had oat straw tea , have you ?
no .
thank you , but it is an appointment . i really should not miss it .
oh , at the dentist s ?
sort of .
well , then , you must come back and visit .
all right .
my door is always open .
all right .
harold ?
how about some ginger pie ?
eh , fine .
i will heat some up . my , it is nice to see you again , harold . how is your hearse ?
oh , it is fine . fine .
do you often model for glaucus ?
heavens no ! i do not have the time . but i like to keep in practice and poor glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form . do you disapprove ?
me ! no . of course not .
really . do you think it is wrong ?
no .
a self portrait . but over here is my favorite . it is titled rainbow with egg underneath and an elephant . do you like it ?
yes . very much .
now i will pump it up . . . . . . and you just turn the handles . okay . what do you smell ?
subways . . . perfume . . . cigarette . . . . . . cologne . . . carpet . . . chestnuts ! . . . u snow ! u
it goes on and on .
what do you think ?
oh . eh , i like it .
here we are , harold . oat straw tea and ginger pie .
certainly a new experience for me .
you look as if you could .
me . ha ! did i tell you i will be eighty on saturday ?
you do not look eighty .
that is the influence of the right food , the right exercise , and the right breathing . greet the dawn with the breath of fire ! of course , there s no doubt the body is giving out . i am well into autumn . i will have to be giving it all up after saturday . sweeten the tea with honey , harold . it is delicious .
that is a nice teapot .
well , it is all very thrilling , of course , but i ask you , harold . . . is it enough ?
i should like to change into a sunflower most of all . they are so u tall u and simple . and you , harold , what flower would you like to be ?
why do you say that ?
because they are all the same .
boy , maude . the way you handle cars . i would never handle a car like that .
the universal language of mankind . what music do you like , harold ?
what happened ?
look .
what ?
over there by the courthouse .
what is it ?
look at it , harold . it is suffocating . it is the smog . people can live with it , but it gives trees asthma . they cannot breathe . see the leaves are all brown . harold , we have got to do something about this life .
but what ?
we will transplant it . to the forest .
but we cannot just dig it up !
why not ?
but this is public property .
do not you think we should get some tools , maybe ?
yes , you are right . we will go see glaucus . come on .
oh , my . we are too late .
is he all right ?
we will come back in the morning .
what is that he is working on ?
an ice sculpture . it is venus the goddess of love , the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream .
it is kind of rough .
he is never finished one yet . he has around him every kind of hand tool known to man , but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake .
look , the ice is melting .
a little after dinner liqueur , harold ?
well , i really do not drink . . .
thank you .
some nuts ? some licorice ? it has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait .
that is that ?
my umbrella ? oh , that is just a relic . i found it when i was packing to come to america . it used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition . a long time ago .
what were you fighting for ?
no .
no more revolts .
oh , yes ! every day . but i do not need a defense anymore . i embrace ! still fighting for the big issues but now in my small , individual way . shall we have a song ?
well , i do not . . .
oh , that was fun . let s play something together .
but i do not play anything .
okay ?
i think he is following us .
he is stopped .
there . oh , i like the feel of soil , do not you ? and the smell . it is the earth . the earth is my body . my head is in the stars . who said that ?
i do not know .
oh , those motorcycles are awfully chilly .
i u think u i see it .
the ice is melting .
yes .
do not you think we should turn off the heat ?
i like glaucus .
yes , so do i . but i think he is a little . . . old fashioned . like a puff , harold ?
well , i really do not smoke .
it is all right . it is organic .
i am sure picking up on vices .
vice ? virtue ? it is best not to be too moral . you cheat yourself out of too much life . aim above morality . as confucius says , do not simply be good . make good things happen .
did confucius say that ?
well they say he was very wise , so i am sure he must have .
you are the wisest person i know .
me ! when i look around me i know i know nothing . i remember though , once long ago in persia , we met a wise man in the bazaar . he was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay . his specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin . the wisest , he said , the truest , the most instructive words for all men at all times . frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel i peered through a magnifying glass to read the words and this too shall pass away . well , the wise man was right if you remember that , you cannot help but live life fully .
yes . i have not lived . i have died a few times .
what was that ?
died ! seventeen times not counting maiming . shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood .
how ingenious ! tell me about them .
well , it is a question of timing , and the right equipment , and plenty of patience . . . you really want to hear about this ?
of course .
yes . i understand . a lot of people enjoy being dead . but they are not dead really . they are just backing away from life . they are players but they sit on the bench . the game goes on before them . at any moment they can join in . reach out ! take a chance ! get hurt maybe . but play as well as you can . go team , go ! give me an l . give me an i . give me a v . give me an e . live ! ! ! ! ! otherwise you will have nothing to talk about in the locker room .
i like you , maude .
look at that sky . it is so big .
it is so blue .
and beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos .
spreckled with uncountable stars . the stars are shining right now . we just cannot see them . just another instance of all that is going on that is beyond human perception .
maude , do you pray ?
pray ? no . i communicate .
with god ?
this is really nice . makes me feel like a kid . i want to do somersaults .
well , why do not you ?
no . i would feel stupid .
want to join me in some cartwheels ?
no . i feel more like yodeling .
it is sinking , harold . going over the horizon where we are all going to go . it is getting dark . let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where er he can .
where is that ?
from the guys who got the matches , of course .
oh , harold . you make me feel like a schoolgirl .
shall i drop by tomorrow ? oh , i have a luncheon date . with this girl .
oh .
i have never met her . my mother set it up .
maude , i must speak to you .
what is it , harold ?
they are going to draft me . in the army . i am going to be sent away .
but they cannot do that . you have not even got the vote .
but they have .
but they will put me in jail .
they would put you in jail , eh ? well , historically you would be in very good company . that is what my husband used to say when we were in the french underground dealing with the gestapo . would you like to do a little raking ? work , i am told , done with no selfish interest , purifies the mind . you sink your separate self and become one with the universal self . on the other hand , senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided .
maude , do you think you can help me ?
do not you talk to me like that , you little foul mouth degenerate ! really , sir , i thought that you at least . . .
do not you advance on me .
just like this .
give me that . i am going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs .
that was not very scary .
no . it had nothing on this afternoon .
oh , you were not scared .
scared ? swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours . i was petrified .
how about some candy floss ?
you sure have a way with people .
look at the stars .
yes . they are old friends .
do you think there is any life up there ?
i do not know . perhaps .
science thinks there is not . that we are all alone in the universe .
we u are u alone you and me and everybody . but we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in china is looking at them , too . someone we do not know and most likely will never see that someone is breathing along with us . and the star gazers of the past from peasant to princes and the star gazers of the future all of us breathing and looking up there . we are alone but look at the stars and never feel lonely .
you should have been a poet .
end where i began .
maude .
yes .
why are there no photographs in these frames ?
i took them out .
why ?
they mocked me . they were representations of people i dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me , and that in time all i would have left would be vague feelings but sharp photographs ! so i tossed them out . my memory fades , i know . but i prefer pictures made by me with feeling , and not by kodak with silver nitrate .
it looks like you . thanks .
harold , that picture is almost twenty five years old .
i was remembering how much this meant to me . it was after the war . . . i had nothing . . . except my life . how different i was then and yet how the same .
you have never cried before . i never thought you would . i thought , despite anything , you could always be happy .
supper for two .
oh , you have thought of everything . and champagne .
it is all right . it is organic .
oh , harold .
. . . which i hope will make you very happy .
oh , i am happy , harold . ecstatically happy . i could not imagine a lovelier farewell .
farewell ?
why yes . it is my eightieth birthday .
but you are not going anywhere , are you ?
oh , harold ! what a fuss this is . so unnecessary .
maude , please . do not die . i could not bear it . please , do not die .
but , harold , we begin to die as soon as we are born . what is so strange about death ? it is no surprise . it is part of life . it is change .
but why now ?
i feel giddy .
but maude , you do not understand . i love you . do you hear me ? i have never said that to anyone in my life before . you are the first . maude . please do not leave me .
oh , harold , do not upset yourself so .
it is true . i cannot live without you .
and this too shall pass away .
never ! never ! i will never forget you . i wanted to marry you . do not you understand ! i love you . i love you !
chardin . dame marjorie . but you may call me maude .
please , do not you realize ? she is dying .
of course , harold s father had a similar sense of the absurd . i remember once in paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next i hear he is arrested for floating nude down the seine experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings . well , that cost quite a little bit of enfluence and d argent to hush up , i can tell you . harold , dear , stop playing with your food . do not you feel well ?
i have a sore throat .
mother .
not now , harold . . . you cannot put me down for monday ?
mother .
harold , please ! i am on the phone .
mother . i am going to get married .
fay , i will call you back . what did you say ?
i am getting married .
to whom ?
i suppose you think this is very funny , harold .
what ?
love ? love ? what do you u know u about her ? where does she come from ? where did you meet her ?
at a funeral .
oh . . . that is wonderful . . . i get an eighty year old pallbearer for a daughter in law ! be reasonable , harold ! you are dealing with your life ! what will people say ? !
i do not care what people say .
i am going to marry the woman i love .
this is insane .
how do you do ?
would you like a cigarette ?
is sunshine your real name ?
do you play ?
no . i am learning the banjo . do you ?
oh , is this your father ?
no . my uncle .
this one is particularly interesting . it is a hari kari blade .
ohhh . that is hari kari ?
an ancient japanese ceremony .
like a tea ceremony ?
tell me , harold , how many of these , eh , suicides have you performed ?
an accurate number would be difficult to gauge .
and why is that ?
well , some worked out better than others some had to be abandoned in the planning stages do you include the first time ? then there s the question of maiming . . .
just give me a rough estimate .
well , a rough estimate . . . i would say fifteen .
fifteen .
a rough estimate .
and were they all done for your mother s benefit ?
i would not say benefit .
i do not think i am getting through to mother like i used to .
does that worry you ?
yes . it does .
why ?
i put a lot of effort into these things .
ah , yes .
and a lot of time .
i am sure . but what else do you do with your time ? do you go to school ?
no .
what about the draft ?
my mother spoke to my uncle victor . he is in the army and he fixed it up .
oh . well , how do you spend your day ?
you mean when i am not working on a . . .
i see . junkyards . what is the fascination there ?
i do not know .
is it the machines ? the noise ? the people ?
no . it is the junk . i like to look at junk .
that is very interesting , harold , and i think very illuminative . there seems to be a definite pattern emerging . your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state , your self destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction . what do you think ? and of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with . recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution . but tell me , what do you do for u fun u ? what activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others ? what do you find fulfilling ? what gives you that certain satisfaction ?
harold ?
huh ?
you do not seem to be listening . i asked do you have any friends ?
no .
none at all ?
well , maybe one .
would you care to talk about this friend ?
no .
is this a friend you had when you were away at school ?
no .
i see . were you happy at school , harold ?
yes .
you liked your teachers ?
yes .
your classmates ?
yes .
your studies ?
yes .
then why did you leave ?
we are not relating today , harold . i sense a definite resistance . a lack of true and helpful communication . i find you a very interesting case , harold , but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho analytical process , and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment . do you understand ?
yes .
i see . tell me , harold , do you remember your father at all ?
no . i would have liked to .
why ?
i would have liked to talk to him .
what would you say ?
i would show him my hearse . and my room , and stuff .
good idea of yours to come out here , harold . it is a lovely spot .
thank you , uncle .
call me sir , harold . first thing you learn in the army an officer deserves your respect .
yes , sir .
let s examine the facts on it . i say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war . i say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy . hell , world war ii gave us the ballpoint pen . that is common knowledge .
during wartime the national suicide rate goes down .
is that a fact ? well , that fits in right along with everything i have been saying . war is not all black .
and so i ask you why the hell did we give up on the germans ? those damn politicians in washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace . hell , look at history . the two best wars this country has fought were against the jerries . now i say , get the krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong , and let s get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support .
they came at me from all sides , hundreds of em . we kept firing zat tat tat tat ! throw the grenades , i shouted . mac , throw the grenades ! he is dead , joe said , and kept right on feeding me bullets . zat tat tat tat ! they kept falling , but they kept coming . bullets whizzing all around me . zot ! joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head . i thought i was done for . but i kept firing . zat tat tat ! only one thought kept me going . kill ! kill ! for mac , and joe , and the rest of the guys . kill ! a blinding flash . i wake up on a stretcher . did we hold ? i asked the medic . yes , sir , he said , and i slipped into unconsciousness .
jeez ! that is a great story ,
well , you will soon have stories like that to tell of your own .
you think so , sir ?
sure . be able to tell your children . something for them to look up to . be proud of .
i hope so , sir . golly i never knew it could be so exciting .
it is the greatest excitement in the world .
to pit your own life against another .
that is right .
to kill . the taste of blood in your mouth .
the moment of truth .
another mangs life in your sights .
yes .
will they really teach me to shoot ?
oh , sure . a variety of weapons .
and to use the bayonet ? pachoie !
oh sure .
how about hand to hand combat ?
yes .
to strangle someone . choke him . squeeze out his life between your hands .
eh ?
how about to slit his throat ?
well , i do not . . .
i would like that . you could see the blood squirt out .
harold , i think you are getting carried away here .
sir , how about souvenirs ?
souvenirs ?
of your kill ears , nose , scalp , privates .
harold !
boy , to think i could maybe make my own .
parasite !
harold !
harold , calm down ! this is . . .
stay where you are , harold .
good afternoon , officer . bit of trouble here ?
yes , ma am . somebody had some trouble parking .
well , it is a tricky turn .
eh , yes , ma m .
tell me is that car parked all right ?
oh yes . that is fine .
ah ! there you are , madam . were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday ?
was that the one with the st . christopher medal on the dashboard ?
yes .
were you also the one who painted the statues ?
oh , yes . how did you like that ?
well , i did not .
oh , do not be too discouraged . for aesthetic appreciation always a little time .
oh , kirsty so eager to play , so reluctant to admit it .
it is different for us .
we have always been here .
oh . no boxes . such a shame .
no more delays , kirsty . no more teasing . time to play .
well , well . all my family together again . how very sweet .
julia .
frank .
i knew you would come .
you knew ?
yes . you are a girl who remembers her promises .
oh , right . daddy s died and gone to heaven , eh ?
yes !
see ? he is here . you should learn to believe your uncle frank .
no ! he should not be here ! it should have been a trick !
he . . . he loved me .
daddy ! daddy ! i love you ! help me !
yes . . . yes . you look . . .
surreal ? strange ? nightmarish ?
it is a beautiful dress . . .
she is done it .
she certainly has .
it is coming .
i want to go back !
i knew you would come back .
so . . . you are kirsty , huh ?
sad , huh ? she is been here six months . her name s tiffany .
that is the matter with her ?
almost complete withdrawal . she has not said a word for nearly two years .
god , that is terrible .
i . . . i had a visitor .
what ?
oh , jesus . i cannot explain . it is . . . it is . i do not know how to help ! i have to save him and i do not know how to help !
kirsty , i am sorry . . . do not understand . i . . .
help . no , no one can help . i just want someone to listen or i will go crazy .
no bad dreams .
well , the sofa is not often used for sleeping on . . .
and you are sure it was a woman ?
do not worry about it . your attitude sucks anyway .
the box . i need the box .
what ?
the boxes . in the house . i told you .
what do you mean ?
the boxes ! i told you .
you did not tell me . do you mean malahide s got . . .
get out of the way .
are you crazy ?
i do not know , kyle . you are the fucking expert . now get out of the way !
why ?
o . k . let s go .
kyle , you do not have . . .
i have to go back . or it will never stop .
what are you talking . . .
i have got to finish it .
i am scared .
well . . . g bye .
but i did not open it ! i did not !
then why are you here ?
but it is true , he is his own hell . just as you are in yours .
wait !
no more deals , kirsty . it is your flesh we want to experience , not your skill at bargaining .
no deals ! just information . information . free of charge . no strings . just information .
what is this ? someone else you think escaped us , like frank ?
no , no , this one did not escape . you told me you would always been in hell . you were wrong . look at it . look . it is you .
nonsense , i . . .
i . . . remember .
where am i ?
you are in the malahide institute . it is a psychiatric hospital . but , hey , do not feel judged it was just the nearest place to bring you . remember ? you and your boyfriend . . . ?
steve . . .
what was it , kid ? smack ? angel dust ? do not tell me acid s back in fashion ?
what are you talking about ? who are you ?
i thought steve had talked to you ?
he talked about demons , huh ?
what the hell are you asking me for ? tag it . move it .
easy , easy . whatever happened , whatever you saw , it is not here now .
i saw it . . . him . but i got away . and i took the box . and i solved it . and they came .

there is a place a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return . from there it infects our dreams . our thoughts . grigory gave us a glance tonight
grigory that is russian , right ? thought they were on our side . . .
grigory yefimovich rasputin
c mon rasputin ? ?
spiritual advisor to the romanovs . in , at a dinner in his honor , he was poisoned , shot , stabbed , clubbed , drowned and castrated .
what the hell was that ? an ape ?
it is got a big stone in its hand
every time the media get a look at him , they come to me . i am running out of lies , trevor .
i thought you liked being on tv .
i do . how many escapes ? this year alone five !
tom he is our guest , not a prisoner .
your guest happens to be six foot five , bright red , and is government funded .
these freaks , trevor , they give me the creeps . and i am not the only one . you are up for review . you and your petting zoo .
a th century statue was destroyed . saint dionysius the aeropagite .

c mon , champ . you look a little woozy , there .
they are not speaking . professor broom had him grounded .

in the end , after you have killed and captured every freak out there there s still one left you .
one falls , two shall arise . so you pop one , two come out . you kill two , you get four . you kill four , you are in trouble . we have to nail em all at once . and the eggs .
we have installed a very handy timer . set it , walk away . cable pulls the safety pins , k boom ! easy to clean , easy to use . . .
those things never work . never .
each of us gets a belt .

it is just a puzzle box .
it is a means to summon us it is called the lament configuration .
who are you ?
cenobites . explorers in the further regions of experience . demons to some . angels to others .
this is not for real .
he does not see us , or hear us . we belong to you , kirsty . and you to us .
let me alone , will you ?
no time for argument .
you did this before , right ?
many times .
nobody escapes us .
suppose he had slipped us . what significance has that ?
we want the man who did this
just in time .
we have got such sights to show you
please . get back into bed .
i have to speak to my father .
that is easily arranged . but first , back into bed .
it is important .
please listen to me
you were holding onto it like grim death .
i do not remember .
well the police are going to want to speak to you . you know that .
oh christ .
julia !
kirsty . it is frank . it is uncle frank .

i am very happy .
julia .
oh my god .
do not look at me .
who are you ?
help me .
tell me who you are .
no . god no .
believe me . it is me . it is really me .
what happened to you ?
his blood . . . on the floor . . . it brought me back .
back from where ?
. . . somebody . . .
you cannot let me stay like this . please . you cannot .
what do you want me to do .
i am hurting
hurting .
my nerves . . . are beginning to work again .
good .
to heal me completely . then we can be away from here , before they come looking .
who ?
poor larry . obedient as ever .
ssh . do not want babe to hear .
you are hurting .
well ?
better . very much better . i would like something to wear . and some cigarettes . will you bring me some ?
later .
what ?
i want an explanation first . i want to know what happened to you .
not know .
a long time .
this is what began it .
a box ?
it is not any box . it is called the lament configuration . it is a puzzle .
let me see .
do not touch it . it is dangerous . it opens doors .
what kind of doors ?
to experience beyond anything ever known . at least that is what i was promised when i bought it . pleasure from heaven or hell . i did not much care which .
hell . . .
i was bored . i would done everything . i would gone to the limits . there was nothing left to experience . at least nothing i could buy on earth .
and you came back here to solve the puzzle
sure . somewhere safe . safe . christ ! they tortured me here . in this room .
who did ?
the cenobites . the creatures the box set free . sometimes i think they are still here . just behind the walls . them and their hooks and their beasts . just waiting to break out again . except that i have got the box .
you are still afraid .
you would be . they tore me apart .
so you were cheated .
they took my body , but my spirit . . . they left that here . in the boards , in the walls . watching the world , but not able to touch it .
and the blood let you out ?
it gave me a little chance , and i took it . they will not get me back . i am going to live , and you are going to help me . yes ?
you cannot love him .
i do not .
so where is the harm ?
i said no .
she will tell them everything . . .
i do not think so . she will want larry first .
that is probably her now . or the police .
maybe .
do not you care ?
there s very little i can do about it .
maybe we should just leave
like this ? look at me ! like this ?
well we cannot just stay here
kirsty .
hi . i got soaked .
there s a towel in the bathroom .
which is where ?
what happened ?
just an accident . he is all right . will you drive ? he needs stitches .
sure .
kirsty ? it is very late .
where is daddy ?
that is the problem ?
i have to see my father .
you look terrible . have you had an accident ?
i was here this afternoon .
this afternoon .
i saw everything .
no , damn you
it is one of these .
we are going to freeze to death .
maybe somebody changed the lock .
like who ?
just a thought
it smells damp .
how long since you were here ?
why did not he want to sell it ?
not exactly modern .
we will sell it . sell everything .
i thought half of it was your brother s ?
you know we have to let kirsty see this place , before we do anything to it . she will love it .
you are still blaming me .
no . i am not .
all right .
so that is the argument ?
no argument .

why not ?
how are you doing through there ?
what have you done ?

i do not know , i have not looked . you know me and blood .

i am going to throw up .
take it slowly .
so damn stupid .
you are done worse .
i will be scarred for life .

i hate to quibble with you rob , but she married her first boyfriend . kevin bannister .
you gotta be kidding me .

i beg your pardon ?
turn it off , barry .
what are you doing ?
i do not want to hear public enemy right now .
public enemy ! all i am trying to do is cheer us up . go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if i care .
i do not want old sad bastard music either . i just want something i can ignore .
but it is my new tape . my monday morning tape . i made it last night just for today .
yeah , well it is fucking monday afternoon . you should get out of bed earlier .
do not you want to hear that is next ?
that is next ?
play it .
say it .
how can it be bullshit to state a preference ?
since when did this shop become a fascist regime ?
since you brought that bullshit tape in .
great . that is the fun of working in a record store . playing crappy pap you do not want to listen to . i thought this tape was going to be , you know , a conversation stimulator . i was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a monday morning and all that , and you just had to ruin it .
we will do it next monday .
nice , barry .
rob . top five musical crimes perpetrated by stevie wonder in the s and s . subquestion is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter day sins ? is it better to burn out than to fade away ?
you just drove a fucking customer away , barry .
we did not even really have it . i happen to know for a fact that the only stevie wonder single we have is do not drive drunk . i was just goofing on the straight , and it never cost you a penny .
not the point .
oh , so that is the point then ?
i do not want you talking to our customers like that again .
barry , i am fucking broke ! i know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we did not like , but it is gotta stop .
bullshit . the guy was going to buy one record which we did not even have and leave and never come back again anyway . why not have a little fun ? big fucking deal .
what did he ever do to you ?
he offended me with his terrible taste .
it was not even his terrible taste . it was his daughter s .
yeah .
i wanna date a musician . . .
i wanna live with a musician . she would write songs at home , ask me what she thought of them , maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes .
what did you tell her about the shop for ?
we are only on the fucking list for marie s gig at the pulaski pub , that is all ! all three of us .
that is fucking great , barry . we can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each . fantastic , barry !
we can take your car .
what ?
what do you mean , what ?
what are you snickering about ?
i am not snickering . i am smiling . because i am happy .
okay . top five side one track ones . number one . . . janie jones , the clash , from the clash .
ehh .
thunder road , bruce springsteen , from born to run . smells like teen spirit , nirvana , nevermind .
oh no , rob , that is not obvious enough . not at all . dick , did you hear that ?
shut up . let s get it on , marvin gaye , from let s get it on . airbag , radiohead , from ok computer .
there s something different about the sound of her voice . . . and what did she mean last night , she has not slept with him yet . yet . what does yet mean , anyway ? i have not seen . . . evil dead ii yet . what does that mean ? it means you are going to go , does not it ?
you are like a little squirrel of music , storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music , musical lint , old shit , shit , shit
just . . . come on , what would it mean to you ? that sentence ? i have not seen evil dead ii yet ?
to me , it would mean that you are a liar . you saw it twice . once with laura oops once with me and dick . we had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off screen in the fourteenth century .
i would think you were a cinematic idiot . and i would feel sorry for you .
no , but would you think , from that one sentence . that i was going to see it ?
i am sorry , rob , but i am struggling here . i do not understand any part of this conversation . you are asking me what i would think if you told me that you had not seen a film that you have seen . what am i supposed to say ?
just listen to me . if i said to you
i have not seen evil dead ii yet , yeah , yeah , i hear you
would you . . . would you get the impression that i wanted to see it ?
. . . but the word yet . . . yeah , you know what , i would get the impression that you wanted to see it . otherwise you would say you did not really want to .
but in your opinion , would i definitely go ?
why would they care ?
i never thought i would say this , but can i go work now ?
fine by me . i still want pay to o clock .
un fucking believable . dick s out on a hot date , rob s boning marie lasalle , and the best looking and most intelligent of all of us is not getting anything at all .
how do you know about that ?
shut the fuck up , barry .
do not be sad , barry . you will find true love someday .
suck my ass .
hey .
what the fuck is that ?
my band .
what band ?
the band that found me and asked me to join .
you are not in a band , barry . you are not a musician . and no posters .
thanks for your support , rob . really appreciate it .
barrytown . barrytown ? is there no end to your arrogance ?
i did not make up the name . it is the steely dan song . and it was in the commitments .
you cannot be called barry and sing in a group called barrytown .
they were fucking called that before i was in it , okay ? it was not my idea .
is not it ?
that was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally , yes . but
great ! that is fucking great ! they only asked you to sing because of your name ! you can stick it above the browser racks over there .
how many tickets can i put you down for ?
none . christ !
you are not even coming ?
of course i am not coming . do i look like i would want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave ? where is it ? the fucking bucktown pub ? ha !
so much for friends , then . you are a bitter bastard , rob , you know that ?
that is up ?
laura . her dad died .
it was jan , and it was a long time after
whatever . okay . tell laura i love her . that would bring the house down . laura s mom could sing it .
fuck off , barry .
i would want one step beyond by madness . and you cannot always get what you want .
because it is in the big chill .
have not seen it .
liar . we saw it in the lawrence kasdan double bill with body heat .
oh . right . but i would forgotten about that . i was not biting the idea .
the little skate fuckers .
no way .
what the fuck is that ?
what ?
i heard you , man . do not give me that what shit . you just told them that you are gonna put out a record with them .
so ? you even said they are good .
like fuck you are .
laura said we could . if we helped out with the posters and stuff . and we did . and we are .
i will give you of the door if you do not play .
we are getting that anyway .
what is she doing ? okay , .
no . we need the gig .
. that is my final offer . i am not kidding . that is how much it means to me not to hear you play .
we are not as bad as you think , rob .
you could not be . look , barry . there s going to be people from laura s work there , people who own dogs and babies and tina turner albums . how are you going to cope with them ?
we are not called barrytown anymore , by the by . they got sick of the barry barrytown thing . we are called sdm . sonic death monkey .
sonic death monkey .
what do you think ? dick likes it .
barry , you are over thirty years old . you owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called sonic death monkey .
i owe it to myself to go right to the edge , rob , and this group does exactly that . over the edge , in fact .
you will be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next friday night .
i am looking for a record for my daughter . for her birthday . i just called to say i love you . do you have it ?
great . can i have it then ?
why not ?
because it is sentimental tacky crap , that is why not . do we look like the kind of store that sells i just called to say i loved you ? go to the mall and stop wasting our time .
that is your problem ? what did i . . . why are you
it is almost impossible to find , especially on cd . yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables . but every other echo and the bunnymen album
i have all of the others .
oh really . well what about the first jesus and mary chain ?
they always seemed . . .
well what about the new echo
that is perverse . do not tell anyone you do not own fucking blonde on blonde . what about television ?
i have a television .
holy shiite ! what the fuck s this ?
mitch ryder and the detroit wheels ?
no . the righteous brothers .
what ?
nothing .
no , not nothing . that is wrong with the righteous brothers ?
nothing . i just prefer the other one .
she should not done it on the number four with a smile .
is not her album called number four with a smile ?
that is what i said .
no , no , no , you said the number four with a smile , and there s no the at the front of the title of the album .
it is a reference to a chinese meal in toronto and i think that there is a the . but i could be wrong .
he is got one !
on clark street !
a couple blocks ! about six !
we work there !
i cannot go to the club tonight , guys .
who are you going to see ?
anna .
anna who ? anna green gables ? anna conda ?
anna moss .
do not do it , rob !
okay , okay leader of the pack . the guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right ? dead mangs curve , jan and dean . . .
did you know that after that song was recorded , jan himself crashed his
somebody s gonna die by blitz . bella lugosi s dead , bauhaus . it is got that creepy halloween feeling .
hey , barry .
oh , hi .
where is rob ?
the malcolm mcclaren of clark street is in his executive suite . do you have an appointment ?
what are you talking about ?
may i help you ?
i am looking for deejay rob gordon .
uh . that is me .
i am caroline fortis from the reader . i want to do a story on you .
right . why ?
well , i used to go to the dodger on your nights , and i saw you are doing it again and that your putting out a record , and it is sort of a then and now story against the backdrop of the chicago music scene with the emphasis on now .
oh . okay .
i thought i would ask you a few questions if that is okay .
what i mean is , i did not mean you look young . you do not . you do not look old either . you look just as old as you are . a bit younger maybe , but not a lot . not much . just right .
right . so . you must have an enormous record collection .
yeah , well . . . let s see . . . what are you are all time top five records ?
pardon me ?
your desert island top five .
oh boy . . . in the club , or at home ?
is there a difference ?
of course . . . well yeah , a bit . sin city by the flying burrito brothers is an all time top five , but i would not play it at the club . it is a country rock ballad . everybody would go home .
nevermind . any five . so four more .
what do you mean , four more ?
well if one of them is this sin city thing
can i go home and work this out and let you know ? in a week or so ?
oh , i am sure i can manage something . . . sin city . new rose , by the damned . hit it and quit it by funkadelic . shipbuilding , elvis costello , japanese import , no horns , or different horns , anyway . . . um . . . mystery train by elvis presley . . . and . . . spaced cowboy by sly and the family stone . a bit controversial , i know , but . . .
fine . that is great .
is that it ?
well , i would not mind a quick chat , if you got the time .
sure , but is that it for the list ?
that is five . so . why did you decide to deejay again ?
well it was a friend s idea , really , and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it . so . . . i should really put a james brown in there
nice friend .
yeah .
that is his name ?
who ? oh . my friend . my friend is laura . a girl . a friend who s a girl .
music for old people . what does that mean ?
okay . dance music for old people ?
oh , you know . . . a lot of people are not too old for clubs but they are too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that . they want to hear old funk and stax and new wave and old school hip hop and some new stuff all together and there s nowhere for them .
and the new label ? and the kinky wizards ?
oh , well , the kinky wizards are you know what ? why do not i just make you a tape ?
would you ? really ? wow . i could have deejay rob gordon play in my own home .
rob , hi , so sorry i missed your call . in la on business . you know how it gets .
yeah , sure . . .
good . great . yeah . . . wow . rob gordon . seems like a million years ago now .
yeah . a billion . right . . . how are you ?
fantastic but i am a little busy right now . listen . do you want to come to dinner saturday ? i am having some friends over and i need a spare man . are you a spare man ?
uh . . . yes , at the moment .
hey charlie .
hey rob .
why did you break up with me for marco ?
fuck ! i knew it ! you are going through one of those what does it all mean things .
huh ?
there s been a rash of them , recently . i find it a little unnerving . in fact marco called a few months back , and he wanted to see me , and rehash the past as they say , and i was not really up for it . do all men go through this ?
it is all kind of lost in the . . . in the dense mists of time now . . . it was not that i really liked marco more . in fact i thought you were more , shall we say , attractive than him . it was just that he knew he was good looking and you did not , and that made a difference somehow . you used to act as if i was weird for wanting to spend time with you , and that got kind of beat , if you know what i mean . your self image started to rub off on me and i ended up thinking that i was strange . and i knew that you were kind and thoughtful . . . you made me laugh , and i dug the way you got consumed by things you loved . . . and marco seemed a bit more , i do not know , glamorous ? more sure of himself ? less hard work , because i felt like i was dragging you around , sort of . a little sunnier . sparkier . i do not know . you know what people are like at that age . they make very superficial judgements . do you think that is superficial ? he was a clown , if it is any consolation .
did you tell that to marco when he did his what does it all mean thing with you ?
morning , dick .
oh , hi . hi , rob .
good weekend ?
yeah , ok . i found the first licorice comfits album at vintage vinyl . the one on testament of youth . never released here . japanese import only .
great .
i will tape it for you .
no , that is okay . really .
cause you like their second one , you said , pop , girls . etc . the one with cheryl ladd on the cover . you did not see the cover though .
yeah , i have not really absorbed that one .
well , i will just make it for you .
that is this ?
hey . did not you steal that one already ?
are you all right ?
yeah . i am sorry . . . look dick , laura and i broke up . she is gone . and if we ever see barry again maybe you can tell him that .
i have ah . . . got some other stuff to tell him anyway , so it is no problem . i will just tell him about , you know , laura , when i tell him the other stuff .
fine .
or rather , bad news and good news , because he likes this person playing tonight . i mean , he liked laura too , i did not mean that . and he likes you . it is just that
i understand , dick .
i always hated this song .
let s not .
rob .
liz , hold on a second what ?
rob !
i will now sell four copies of cats and dogs by the royal trux .
well we rang today .
do not worry about it , dick . barry s an asshole .
i am sorry , rob , that is , it is
can i do anything ?
what is this .
it is vince and justin .
laura ? are you okay ?
yeah , i am fine . i am off the phone .
you look upset .
i am upset , but i am fine .
maybe i should talk to him .
mmmm , no . not a good idea .
conflict resolution is my job , laura .
can i help you ?
what needs sorting out ?
come on , rob . my relationship with laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal .
funnily enough i have not been too thrilled about it .
we are not talking jokey understatement here , rob . we are talking actionable harassment . ten phone calls a night , hanging around outside my house . . .
yeah , well , i have stopped all that now .
we have noticed and we are glad . but , you know . . . how are we going to make peace here ? we want to make things easier for you . what can we do ? obviously i know how special laura is , and i know things cannot be good for you at the moment . i would hate it if i lost her . but i would like to think that if she decided she did not want to see me anymore , i would respect that decision . do you see what i am saying ?
yeah .
good . so shall we leave it at that then ?
i dunno .
good . so shall we leave it at that then ?
good . so shall we leave it at that then ?
so shall we leave it at that then ?
i dunno .
you do not have to go this second . you can stay until whenever .
we have done the hard part now . i might as well , you know . . .
jeez . he goes on long enough .
shit !
hi .
hi .
i thought i could give you a lift back .
are you coming home ?
yes . well , i am coming over to your house to get some things .
how can you like art garfunkel and marvin gaye ? it is like saying you support the israelis and the palestinians .
it is not like saying that at all , actually , rob . art garfunkel and marvin gaye make pop records
made . made . marvin gaye is dead , his father shot him in
whatever , and the israelis and the palestinians do not . art garfunkel and marvin gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute , and the israelis and the palestinians are . art garfunkel and marvin gaye
alright , alright but
hey ! marvin gaye ! got to give it up ! that is our song ! marvin gaye is responsible for our entire relationship !
is that right ? i would like a word with him .
but do not you remember ?
you used to care more about things like marvin gaye than you do now . when i first met you , and i made you that tape , you loved it . you said and i quote it was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection .
well , i liked you . you were a deejay , and i thought you were hot , and i did not have a boyfriend , and i wanted one .
so you were not interested in music at all ?
but laura . . . that is me . that is all there is to me . there is not anything else . if you have lost interest in that , you have lost interest in everything .
yes . look at me . look at our the apartment . what else do i have , other than records and cds ?
and do you like it that way ?
have you tackled the great reorganization yet ?
so . where have you been staying for the last week ?
i think you know that .
i am sorry . i have not been very fair to you . that is why i came here to the store this evening . i feel terrible , rob . this is really hard , you know .
good . so . is it my job ?
what ? gimme a fucking break . is that what you think ? that your not big enough a deal for me ? jesus , gimme a little credit , rob .
i do not know . it is one of the things i thought of .
what were the others ?
just the obvious stuff .
that is the obvious stuff ?
i guess it is not that obvious , then .
what ?
did you say something ?
no . so . is it working out with ian ?
rob . do not be childish .
why is that childish ? your living with the guy ! i am just asking how it is going .
i am not living with him . i have just been staying with him for a few days until i work out what i am doing . look , this has nothing to do with anyone else . you know that , do not you ? i left because we were not exactly getting along , and we were not talking about it . and i suddenly realized that i like my job , and i like what my life is could be turning into , and that i am getting to a point where i want to get my shit together and i cannot really see that ever happening with you , and yeah , yeah , i sort of get interested in someone else , and that went further than it should have , so it seemed like a good time to go . but i have no idea what will happen with ian in the long run . probably nothing .
look . maybe you will grow up and we will get it together , you and me . maybe i will never see either of you again . i do not know . all i know is that it is not a good time to be living here .
so , what , you have not definitely decide to dump me ? there s still a chance we will get back together ?
i do not know .
well , if you do not know , there s a chance , right ? it is like , if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said , i do not know if he is got a chance of survival or not , then that does not mean the patient s definitely going to die , now does it ? it means he might live . even if it is only a remote possibility .
i suppose so .
so we have a chance of getting back together again .
oh , rob , shut up .
hey , i just want to know where i stand . what chance
well if you could tell me roughly it would help .
okay , okay , we have a nine percent chance of getting back together . does that clarify the situation ?
yeah . great .
i am too tired for this now . i know i am asking a lot , but will you take off for a while so i can get my stuff packed up ? i need to be able to think while i do it and i cannot think while you are here .
no problem . if i can ask one question .
fine . one .
it sounds stupid .
nevermind .
you will not like it .
just ask it !
is it better ?
is what better ? better than what ?
well . sex , i guess . is sex with him better ?
jesus christ , rob . is that really that is bothering you ?
of course it is .
you really think it would make a difference either way ?
i do not know .
well the answer is that i do not know either . we have not done it yet .
never ?
i have not felt like it .
but not even before , when he was living upstairs ?
no . i was living with you , remember ? we have slept together but we have not made love . not yet . but i will tell you one thing . the sleeping together is better .
the sleeping together is better but not the sex because you have not done it was him yet .
hi .
hi . i have been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and i am thinking i did not take them with me . have you seen them around ?
i will look for em . how you doing ?
i am sorry to call , but i need that stuff . . .
fine , i am sure it is in the file at home . i will call you when i find it , and then we will talk .
we will talk some other time .
so , how are you ?
have you slept with him yet ?
i told you i slept with him .
no , not i mean have you , you know
is that why you wanted to see me ?
i guess .
oh , rob . what do you want me to say ?
you kind of have to start with elvis costello , but where ? motel matches ? i want you ? i hope you are happy now ? green shirt ? his records should be sealed in cases that say in case of vicious betrayal , smash glass . where did you sleep last night , sure , but by robert johnson or by nirvana ? maybe a liz phair track . there are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with . some devil s advocate stuff . the silver jews could be good when you are ready to start putting it all behind you . . . but i think we are getting ahead of ourselves there . ah . dylan . bob fucking dylan . now bob dylan would the phone rings . he pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing .
and anyway , i keep trying to tell you , that is not really the point , is it ? the point is we got ourselves into an awful mess , rob . . . are you there ? what are you thinking ?
nothing .
we can meet for another drink if you want . so i can explain it better . i owe you that much .
look , i gotta go . i work too , you know .
will you call me ?
i do not have your number .
call me at work . we can arrange to meet properly . i do not want this to be the last conversation we have . i know what you are like .
hello .
it is me .
i figured it was . where are you ?
i think the big question here is where are you , if you do not mind my saying so , and i think i know where you are . you are running . on the run . you are running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship , and you are just going to hit it again with ian but it is going to be with a world music bunny rabbit looking earth shoe wearing doctor who watching twit who does not really understand you , not the way that i do and will more in the future , and you will have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you are in now , only later . and with . . . him .
are you still in love with me ?
jesus . i do not know . i will talk to you later .
think about what i said . i mean , if you want to experiment , or whatever
i am not experimenting . why do not you go experiment .
i do not want to . do not need to . i love you .
you do not ever think about other people ?
i called and called but you were out . i thought i would be gone before you got back .
is that the last of it ?
yep . i might have missed some stuff . i am so used to some things being here that i do not even notice them .
those look heavy . where is ian ?
he is at home . listen , i cannot believe he went to the store . i am mortified , actually . i am really sorry . he had no right to do that , and i told him so .
i am sure .
you still together ? going all right ?
i do not really want to talk about it , to be honest .
that bad , eh ?
fix it up . it will make you feel better .
i will bet you cannot remember what you were doing here , can you ? i mean , how much are you making now ? sixty ? seventy ? and you were living in this shitty place .
you know i did not mind . and it is not as if ray s place is any better .
i am sorry , but can we get this straight ? what is his fucking name , ian or ray ? what do you call him ?
ray . i hate ian .
this is where you are supposed to say that you have not laughed this much in ages , and then you see the error of your ways .
you make me laugh much more than ray does , if that is what you are getting at . but i already knew you could make me laugh . it is everything else i do not know about .
you know i am a good person .
mmm hmm .
you know that i can cook my ass off when i feel like it .
do not forget your cds .
those are not mine .
sure they are .
they are not really , though , are they ? i know you bought them for me , and that was really sweet of you , but that was when you were trying to turn me into you . i cannot take them , i know they would just sit around staring at me , and i would feel embarrassed by them and . . . they do not fit in with the rest of that is mine , do you understand ? that sting record you bought for me . . . that was a present for me . i like sting and you hate him . but the rest of this stuff . . . who the hell is nick lowe ? or gram parsons ? or the boredoms ? i do not know these people . i . . .
okay , okay . i get the picture .
i am sorry to go on about it . but , i do not know , there s a lesson here somewhere , and i want to make sure you get it .
i got it . you like sting but you do not like gram parsons , because you have never heard of him .
you are being deliberately obtuse .
i guess i am .
hello .
guess who i just saw , right by my store ? ian . in starbuck s . neat , huh ?
i cannot talk right now .
are you alright ?
pigsty .
do not worry about it . just get into bed . worry about that when you are better .
pig died .
who the fuck s pig ?
i am sorry .
no , no . when are you going home ?
me ?
my dad liked you . and mom never told him we would split , because he was not up to it and . . . oh , i do not know . i do not really understand it . i think she thinks he will be able to see that is going on . it is like . . . he is been through so much , what with dying and everything , that she does not want to upset him any more than she has to .
do you want me to be there ?
look , are you coming or not ?
yes , of course .
liz will give you a lift . she knows where to go and everything . . . i do not have time to talk , rob . i have got too much to do .
are you going to lie in that flower bed all night ?
you are soaking .
mmnn .
i can see why you say that . look , i am sorry . i really am . the last thing i wanted was . . . that is why i left , because . . . i lost it , and i did not want to blow my top in there , and . . . look , the reason i fucked everything up was because i was scared . i just wanted you to know , that is all .
thank you . i appreciate it . i cannot reciprocate .
what do you mean ?
i did not mess things up because i was scared . i slept with ray because i was sick of you . and i needed something to snap me out of it .
sure , i understand . look , i do not want to take up any more of your time . you get back , and i will wait here for a bus .
i do not want to go back .
what do you want to do ?
when are you going back ?
i do not know . sometime . later . listen , rob , would you have sex with me ?
what ?
i want to feel something else than this . it is either that or i go home and put my hand in the fire . unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm .
i have only got a couple left . i am saving them for later .
hello . it does not seem so long ago that i looked at you from here .
hi .
you know , with ray . . .
oh , rob , we are not going to go through that again .
no , no . it is not . . . are you still on the pill ?
yes , of course . there s nothing to worry about .
look , we can do other things .
laura . . .
so if you had a bit more energy we would stay split . but things being how they are , what with you wiped out , you would like us to get back together .
everything s too hard . maybe another time i would have the guts to be on my own , but not now i do not .
what about ian ?
ray s a disaster . i do not know what that was all about , except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade , i guess , and blow it all apart .
mission accomplished .
let s go home . okay ?
c mon . i want to know .
want to know what , exactly ?
what it was like .
it was like sex . what else could it be like ?
was it like good sex or was it like bad sex ?
that is the difference ?
you know the difference .
look , we are okay now . we just had a nice time . let s leave it at that .
oh , c mon , laura . just say something . lie , if you want . it would stop me asking you questions and it would make me feel better .
well i was gonna lie and now i cannot , because you would know i was lying .
well why the fuck would you want to lie , anyway ?
to make you feel better .
look , rob . if great sex was as important as you think it is , and if i was having great sex with him , then we would not be lying here now . and that is my last word on the subject , okay ?
. . . like mexico . or jamaica . or new york , even .
hey , great idea . what i will do is , tomorrow i will get a hold of a box full of mint elvis presley s on the sub label , and i will pay for it that way .
i will pay for you . even though you owe me money . we have to do something with the money i earn . i need to . i deserve it . you can just think of it as winning the lottery .
fantastic . the girlfriend lottery .
money does not matter . i do not care how much you earn . i would just like you to be a little happier in your work , but beyond that you can do what you like .
but it was not supposed to be like this . when i met you we were the same people and now we are not , and . . .
how ? how were we the same people ?
well , you were the kind of person who came to the artful dodger and i was the kind of person who deejayed at the artful dodger . you wore jeans and t shirts , and so did i . and i still do , and you do not .
because i am not allowed to . i still do , after work . so , what ? should we just break up ? is that what you are saying ? because if you are , i am going to run out of patience .
no , but . . .
but what ?
but why does not it matter that we are not the same people we used to be ?
you have not changed so much as a pair of socks in the years i have known you . if we have grown apart , then i am the one who s done the growing , and all i have done is change jobs .
and hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and . . .
i cannot go to work with my hair dyed pink . and i can afford to go shopping more now , and i have met a couple people i like over the last year or so .
you are tougher .
more confident , maybe .
harder .
less neurotic . are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life ?
i am alright .
yeah , you are alright . but you are certainly not happy . so what happens if you get happy ? and yes i know that is the title of an elvis costello album , i use the reference deliberately to catch your attention . should we split up because i am used to you being miserable ? what happens if you , i do not know , start you are own record label , and it is a success ? time for a new girlfriend ?
you are being stupid .
all i am saying is , you have to allow for things to happen to people , most of all to yourself . otherwise , that is the use ?
hi .
hi . what are you doing ?
nothing .
wanna go to dinner ?
where ?
at paul and miranda s . paul from work .
oh . well . we do not really get along . paul and i .
i know . but you have never met . it just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him .
you did that deliberately . you knew all along i would like them . it was a trick .
i called dan koretzky because he
has drag city records , i know , i know . you told dan koretzky about this ?
yeah , and he said it is a good way to break out a record . especially for what he said , and i quote , would be a highly anticipated event , locally . he helped me put out a press release .
what ?
just local , of course .
and the triumphant return of dj rob gordon ? triumphant ? return ?
i had that idea when i was living with ian and it was such a good idea that i was annoyed we were not together anymore . it might even be why i came back .
you had no right . supposing i was doing something that could not be cancelled ?
what do you ever do that cannot be cancelled ?
that is not the point . i mean , what if the single is not done in time ?
barry said its done .
barry ? barry knows about this ?
they will go on early . nobody will even be there yet and i told them they cannot play for more than a half hour .
it is no joke . i am responsible for what happens , you know . embarrassment aside , there s a lot of money and effort in this , at least by my standards . i have to put down a deposit for the room . i have to pay the pressing plant for the records , sleeve them , sticker them
i am sorry i have been acting like a jerk . i do appreciate what you have done for me , and i know you have done it for the best possible reasons , and i do love you , even though i act like i do not .
that is okay . you seem pissed off all the time , though .
are you worried about tomorrow night ?
are you going to talk to me , or shall i get my paper out ?
i am going to talk to you .
what are you going to talk to me about ?
i am going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not . to me .
ha ha ha . hoo hoo hoo .
i mean it .
i know .
oh , well thanks a fucking bunch .
i am sorry . but two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for the reader , were not you ?
not in love , exactly , but . . .
well forgive me if i do not think of you as the world s safest bet .
would you marry me if i was ?
no . probably not .
right . okay , then . shall we go ?
do not sulk . what brought all this on ?
i do not know .
very persuasive .
are you persuadable ?
no . i do not think so . i am just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days . fair enough ?
fair enough .
so ?
i am just sick of thinking about it all the time .
about what ?
this stuff . love and marriage . i want to think about something else .
i have changed my mind . that is the most romantic thing i have ever heard . i do . i will .
shut up . i am only trying to explain .
i mean , maybe you are right . but were you really expecting me to say yes ?
i dunno . did not think about it , really . it was the asking that was the important thing .
i am an idiot . i should have played the record first . this place is about to get burned down .
rob here .
hey . it is liz .
that is happening .
you called this morning ?
yeah . i just wanted to thank you for that message last night . it made me feel like . . . like less of an asshole .
how are you holding up ?
actually , i am fine . i am great . last night i got to thinking , you know what ? maybe it is time to move on . maybe we are just not right for each other . or maybe we are . but time will tell and at this point i am going to be fine with whatever s meant to be . you know ?
that is the hey , liz
to think i sympathized with you for two seconds ! poor rob ! laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs . you let me believe that !
it is true !
rob ! two years ago you got laura pregnant you then proceeded to cheat on her ! you borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back ! and then , just a few weeks ago , you told her you were unhappy with her and were kind of looking around for somebody else !
so the minister says nice things , and then , what , we all troop outside and they bury him ?
it is a crematorium .
you are kidding . a crematorium ? jesus .
what difference does it make ?
is ray going ?
no . they do not know him . and ken liked you . rob , ken did not die for your benefit , you know . it is like everybody s a supporting actor in the film of your life story .
enough , liz .
enough of what ?
i know i cannot speak now because laura s father died , and i just have to take it because otherwise i am a bad guy , with the emphasis on guy , self centered . well , i am fucking not , not all the time , anyway , i am really sorry jo . but you know , liz . . . i can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself . and maybe you think i should , but it is not much of a life , you know ?
maybe i have been a little unfair . but is this really the time ?
only because it is never the time . i cannot go on apologizing my whole life , you know ?
good . cause i am enjoying myself .
so you live in chicago now ?
do not you like that ?
hi , marie .
she just wanted to pick up some stuff . no big thing . a relief , actually .
god , i hate that time . that pick up stuff time . i just went through that before i came here . you know that song patsy cline times two i play ? that is about me and my ex dividing up our record collections .
it is a great song .
is that why you came to chicago in the first place ? because of , you know , dividing up your record collection and stuff ?
you share a place with t bone ?
no way ! i would cramp his style . and i would not want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall . i am way to unattached for that .
awhile back , dick and barry and i agreed that what really matters is what you like , not what you are like . . .
yeah , but if you heard this band called the crumblers , you would
what do you mean , the crumblers ? you know the crumblers ? nobody s heard the crumblers . except me .
books , records , films these things matter . call me shallow but it is the damn truth , and by this measure i was having one of the best dates of my life .
yeah , but you know that is his best film and nobody s even seen it ?
the conformist .
exactly ! fucking ex actly !
you have not even seen it !
are you okay ?
yes . you ?
for now . but i would not be if i thought this was the end of the evening .
i am sure it is not .
good . in that case , i will fix us something else to drink . you sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee ?
tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees rob , standing and holding his jacket .
i would better go . i gotta get up early . go over to my parents .
i would like it if you could stay the night .
oh , right . alright .
jesus , so much for delicacy . i pegged you for a master of understatement , beating around the bush and all that buzz .
i use it but i do not understand it when other people use it .
so you will stay ?
yeah .
would you like me to turn the lights out ? or would you like them on ?
which way are you going ?
that way . you ?
that way .
and so it is . i will talk to you later .
i will call you .
yeah ?
hi , mom .
everything all right ?
great . super fantastic .
how is the store ?
so so . up and down .
she left . she is gone .
what do you mean ? where did she go ?
how would i know ? gone . girlfriend . leave . not say where gone . laura move out .
well call her mother .
hello ? anybody there ?
i am all right , if that is that is upsetting you .
you know that is not that is upsetting me .
well it fucking should be , should not it ?
i knew this would happen . what are you going to do rob ?
i am going to drink this bottle of wine watch tv and go to bed . then tomorrow i will get up and go to work .
and after that ?
meet a nice girl and have children . i promise the next time we talk i will have it all sorted out .
i knew this was going to happen .
then what are you getting so upset about ?
what did laura say ? do you know why she left ?
it is got nothing to do with marriage , if that is what you are getting at .
so you say . i would like to hear her side of it .
mom ! for the last fucking time , i am telling you laura did not want to get married ! she is not that kind of girl ! to use a phrase . that is not what happens now .
what do you think ?
it is the best collection i have ever seen .
these are worth at least , i do not know
i know what they are worth . give me fifty and get them out .
but you must have
i must have nothing . their my husband s .
and you must not be getting along too well right now , huh ?
he is in jamaica with a twenty three year old . a friend of my daughter s . he had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and i told him to fuck off , so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever i go , minus a ten percent commission . which reminds me . can you make sure you give me a five ? i want to frame it and put it on the wall .
it must have taken him a long time to get them together .
look . can i pay you properly ? you do not have to tell him what you got . send him forty five bucks and blow the rest . give it to charity . or something .
that was not part of the deal . i want to be poisonous but fair .
look . . . i . . . i am sorry . i do not want to be any part of this .
suit yourself . there are plenty of others who will .
that is why i am trying to compromise . what about fifteen hundred ? they are worth five times that .
sixty .
thirteen hundred .
seventy five .
eleven hundred . that is my lowest offer .
with eleven hundred he could come home , and that is the last thing i want .
i am sorry but i think you better talk to someone else .
can i buy this otis redding single off you ?
sure . ten cents .
oh , come on ! let me give you ten dollars for this , and you can give the rest away for all i care .
eno import . sigue sigue sputnik . break beats . serge gainsbourg . ryuchi sakamoto , syd barrett . . . that is going on here ? are you guys stealing for other people now ?
naw . those are for us .
i think you have more .
well we do not .
jesus . that thing s been in the bargain bin for six months ! was it just your criminal nature or what ? hell , i would have given it to you for free .
uh , yes i , like , do . . . it is simple . you make the tracks recording studio deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut , the master is then dubbed to submasters , which are the mothers , as their called , for each press in the plant . you press the cd s or records , put in your cover art , and that is it .
records are those big round black things , right ?
it is rough . but it shows promise . we record a couple of songs right , in a studio . i will take care of the rest . i will put out your record . any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle , between us and you guys .
wait a minute . island records charged u a million five against their overhead for one plane ride .
we are not there yet , justin .
i am vince .
we saw this ad in the personals for two swingers looking for a renaissance fair .
nice .
i cannot figure out why he is doing it . he is been richard taupin at least since . and the guys rich . you should see the stuff he has in that shop .
maybe he is hiding from something .
probably just some exec ducking an ex wife .
dr . kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral . the father looked just like richard . even had a mark on his cheek .
how old is richard ?
p . d . says , but he barely looks .
taupin , is not that the guy moran picked up the other night ?
yeah .
he would want to know about all this .
mr . congeniality ? let him find his own clues . there s a journal article in this somewhere .
well , the cream of society awaits . if you are ever in the neighborhood . . .
i warned you .
does not have a head , does he ?
how is your uncle ? i hardly ever see him anymore .
did not look like it came from toys are us , that is why i called you .
did not think it was my buddy over there .
figured you knew more about swords than i did .
claymore .
huh ?
scottish claymore . take a french epee , add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business , and you have got a claymore .
you are the expert .
that stuff will put you away if you are not careful .
there was a count . count dusan . he would invite the local peasants to his chateau , fill them full of wine , then slice their bellies so he could reuse it . the symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me .
you are very macabre .
it is my birthday .
happy birthday .
would you like more tea ?
he was unsual .
why ?
well , this is a small town , and it was even smaller then . most all the babies i delivered were from local families . richard s parents were just passing through when his mother s time came . i did it right here at the house .
then you did not know richard later on .
no .
i have been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies .
do not know about any of that . suppose nobody does .
i do not follow you .
poor little tyke did not have a chance . hopelessly premature . he died a few days after he was born .
the boy died ?
have you spoken to anyone else about this ?
there was this one fella . asked a lot of questions . i was out of town but i heard he spent near a full day in the records office .
would you remember his name ?
this is against the rules .
so s playing choo choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of
okay okay .
taupin , richard marshall . born march , in church hill , maryland . received first driver permit in philadelphia .
church hill , that is pretty close , is not it ?
do you play ?
yes .
miss cartwright , what is it i can do for you ?
i would like to ask you about the claymore .
it is not mine .
it is quite rare you know , some thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years .
byzantine ?
basil the ii .
charming guy , basil . once after beating an army of serbians he blinded all but
good reflexes .
someone beat you .
have you taken to touring small town cemetaries , miss cartwright ?
grave robbers ?
probably .
who ?
people like that rarely leave business cards .
i do not know what you are talking about .
i think you do . better yet , i do not think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place . and i think mr . smith , whoever he is , now knows that .
you have an active imagination .
i have been to church hill .
i have friends .
jesus christ .
you will be safe here . he will not kill in a church .
why not ?
tradition .
he tried to kill me last night .
where ?
who is he ?
at the moment ? carl smith .
what will you do now ?
you need not worry miss cartwright . i have been at this a very long time .
he called you macleod .
not your concern .
i left a man dead in felton . but you do not really care , do you ?
that bothers you ?
he was innocent .
he is dead . whatever i may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now .
what about me ?
you ?
i am a witness to a murder . that seems to put me pretty high on your friend s chop list .
have you gone to the police ?
no .
why not ? i am sure they would love to hear your story .
i would rather hear yours .
you are being foolish .
i am a historian , mr . taupin . only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face .
he sees me as a threat .
no .
no one knows you are here ?
no . i had to talk to you .
you had to do nothing !
you are wrong .
you are a fool .
is this what you killed them with ?
you have been listening to rumors .
our cars were seen together in felton . they are calling me an accessory to murder .
that is all that ?
you did kill those men .
not all of them .
when you finish , what then ?
i go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad mr . taupin .
you make it all sound so simple .
the only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property i have aquired . that requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in gettysburg . but that is where you come in .
you want me to front for you .
there was a man once . just a simple woodcarver . but he understood . more than anyone he could see to the heart of it . it never ends . today is the same as the first . tomorrow will be the same as today . so much time . and all of it wasted . you love history ?
yes .
the estate stuff is pretty straight forward . just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat .
no . so what now ? we just wait ?
yes .
it is some sort of party the town is throwing .
they do it each year .
maybe it would do us both good .
here , try this . i suppose they are still making women the same as back then .
it is beautiful .
i do not know any of these . i will make a fool of myself .
william taupin seems to have left his mark .
yes .
and you are william taupin , are not you ?
you are using your songs name .
then you must be at least years old .
at least .
it is frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people s lives .
a factor of age .
i hope i never get that old .
i must be insane . leaving work , ditching cops . all to follow a murderer . a very old murderer , but a murderer just the same .
why are you here ?
i have been telling myself it is the award winning journal article i am going to write . but it is not . it is you .
i see .
i am not even sure why .
hardly a reason to run off with a murderer .
my life has been chock full of people with complications and weak nesses . i cannot stand it . but you are different . it is in your hands . a clarity .
you are a very perceptive young woman .
who are you ?
that would be difficult to explain .
i carried that rifle in world war i . this book is a th century policy report for the king of austria . the diploma is my con ference of degree in latin from trinity college . class of . it goes on .
that is why smith called you macleod .
yes .
he knows about you .
he is older than i .
what could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction .
sometimes i think it is just for something to do . a conquest to be the last . something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away . some thing to replace the love that can never work .
that is insane .
perhaps . there is something more . an inheritance .
of bodies .
i did not kill the watchman .
you killed those other two .
not the same .
what about that family in ?
sometimes innocents become involved .
you and your buddy make a real team , do not you ? exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between .
there are differences .
you kill with your left hand ?
i have not killed you .
do not .
come here , brenna .
what is it like ? being you ?
empty . and fear . fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you . it can never last , and in the end you always end up destroying both .
but you are known so much . history i will only read about .
it is all the same . half lives that never go away .
what is it you want ?
gettysburg s an hour s drive at most . you should be back by nightfall .
will i see you again ?
that is wrong ?
what is it ?
get out .
no !
the emptyness . the years and years of void . nothingness . bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness . who would have guessed ?
the inheritance .
life . it is the gift and the under standing of life .
you have lived forever .
it will be horrible . the future . i may die tomorrow or , tomorrows . i can promise you nothing . nothing but a moment . maybe two . but a moment of love , is that not worth a lifetime ?
forget it .
i am just curious .
are not you getting a little old for this ? you flunked out of law school .
now there s a new topic .
forgers do it all the time . they take the birth certificate of some one who died young and use it to get legit i . d . usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it .
thanks .
a murder .
you better have a warrant . that is my notebook , you have got no right to be sticking your fingers into it .
i have got a morgue filling up with bodies . that is my right .
what do you want from me ?
i am calling an attorney .
you and i should talk first .
what are you going to tell them ? that you are protecting a man who s killed four people ?
four ?
all fashionably without heads .
spare me the details .
but there s more . wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in felton , delaware . some locals spotted two cars with d . c . plates and surprise surprise , they turn out to be registered to our own brenna cartwright and the ever popular richard taupin .
what are you getting at , moran ?
you have been a busy little beaver . especially with that records mess up in church hill . your notes are very complete . naturally my feelings were crushed when you did not rush right over and tell us what you knew . in fact , we are considering book ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder .
it will never stick .
but we might just give it the ole college try . what with the court back ups , it could be days before you got an arraignment . but then , i am sure the flunk out neice of the d . a . knows all about that .
you are an asshole , moran .
i want taupin .
what makes you so sure he is the one ?
just for laughs we raided wonder boy s house . there was a gallon of one of the corpse s blood in his carpet . i think it was about then i withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year .
that is all of this got to do with me ?
what were you doing in felton ?
research . if your pal was there i never saw him .
i have witnesses that can put the two of you together .
never take up poker , detective .
come on brenna , your ass is already in a sling , do not drag me into it .
all i need is for you to check the name .
you talked to your supervisor lately ? he is burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight . that on top of the cops bugging him .
corey , you owe me .
it is that important ?
good way to lose your job .
some job . card filing and cabinet dusting . four years in this dump and i have not written anything for wilson that a wounded yak could not do .
i liked the bit you did about baltic chastity belts . too bad no one else did .
it is bullshit . everything . my job , the people i get involved with , i am up to here with it .
who is it ?
i do not believe him .
why ?
hang on a sec , you did your little favor for the boys downtown , i am sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here .
someone should check him out . maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over . he has one , he might have two .
you see that desk ? your desk ? you see the crap piled up on it ?
requiem acer nam donaei
what are you doing man ?
et lux perpetua
you will not be bringing the church into this .
be quiet .
auditorium nostrum
stop .
in nomine sanctus esperitu
afternoon .
your name is conor ?
aye .
juan cid romirez . chief surveyor and alchemist .
you are not from these parts .
i have not much to offer , mr . romirez from spain , but you are welcome to that is here .
your back , it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle ?
five years past me clan fought another over some thing i cannot even re member .
your marks would suggest great injury .
i was nearly killed .
i did at that .
and but for a mark you are well as any man , no ?
aye .
i was driven out .
and now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew .
how can you know this ?
hmm , que rico . what is it you call this ?
pheasant .
you scots have a way with game . it still has life in it . spirit . back home the food is so . . . domestic .
why are you here ?
i was sent by his majesty of spain to inverness as a con sultant on matters of metal .
you are a long way from inverness .
in my travels i heard the story of the macleod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this earth .
you know me home . me name .
when i was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me . all thought i would die or be maimed for life . but i healed quickly . and like you i paid the price for being different .
you are the same ?
do you ever feel a flow , as if some thing were pushing against you ?
yes . always .
does it change with me in the room ?
it is less .
you feel you know me .
i do not know why .
he told me there could be only one .
some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad ition their lives have known the game . you and i conor , we are different from all others around us . you know this , you can feel it . we are flesh and bone like any man , but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure , permanently .
i do not understand .
you are still so very young .
i am twenty two .
conor , you and i , we cannot be killed .
what ?
it is as you are .
listen to me . hear the words .
this is madness !
it is the truth .
three days you have laid there . it is time you ate .
this cannot be .
you are not dead , boy . accept it .
this is monstrous . i will burn in hell for all eternity .
what is to become of me ? am i to wander the earth forever like a ghost ?
you will live . survive .
then they were right . i am evil . this is god s punishment .
you have done nothing wrong conor macleod .
why does he want to kill me ?
you recall how i spoke of the push you feel and how i make it less ?
aye .
it is always less with my living . far or near . but if i were to die the push would become stronger than ever before . there is power in this . and as long as you and i live , the knight can never have it all .
but we cannot be killed .
there is an imperfection . for all your healing , if your head ever leaves your neck , you are dead . you can survive anything but steel against your threat . then it is over . the end .
how can i stop such a man ?
hide . run to the ends of the earth till you learn . you must learn to defend yourself . in this i can help .
why ?
harder . concentrate harder .
me arm hurts .
harder ! you swing like an impotent cow !
go to hell .
impotent cow .
it will take less effort as you learn .
you have a gift . one you must protect .
and what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt ?
the fabric of life . the spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another .
you are no match for scot , mr . romirez . we are raised as riders .
what is the fascinatioon ? it is only a leaf .
as they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes . to feel it , to know it , is to be in touch with the will of every living thing .
i do not think i like the sound of that .
it does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds . but the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening . for it gives you great strength . the strength of knowledge . the ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be .
i feel hardly nothing .
you have not been fully trained . but you will learn . and you will be good , i can feel that . you have apt itude . this is why our friend is so concerned .
but why be so concerned about me ?
this power is divided amongst you , me , and others like cuts in a pie . but the cuts are not equal . some , like you and he , have more . much more .
and you ?
i am a small player . but if by helping you i can keep that monster from being the last , then perhaps my life has meant something .
i am not ready for this .
you must be . you have responsibilities . you must learn the rules . you can never attract attention to yourself , never show the side that will draw others to you . you will always know when you are in the presence of another . beware . but more importantly conor macleod , will be your battle against time . in the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat . people will become a transitory , pathetic lot . the only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent . but life without morality , without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love , is no life at all . that is how the others exist . nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last . keep your soul sewed to the earth . do not become one of them .
of course .
you are young , inexperienced . you do not know what time can do . how it can sap all pity , all love .
that is not me .
go ahead , senor . i have my friend to keep me company .
i am your future husband , remember ?
i have no future husband .
my future husband died in battle against the sutherlands .
what are you saying ? i am standing here as real as you .
you cannot be real , conor . you had the last rites . no man has been cut half as bad and lived .
but i did live .
live ? in less than a week you are prancing about the country like a squirrel .
so why the crazy talk ? it is a miracle it is . saint andrew has smiled on me . on us .
some think not .
who ?
there s rumor in the village . some call it magic .
that is mad . surely you do not take their word ?
i do not know , conor . it is not natural . maybe something has touched you .
you are sounding like that mad woman , widow baggins .
please not be touching me , conor .
i will not take that kind of talk from you . from those others below , maybe . but not from you .
leave me alone , conor . please .
if you send me away now , mara , i will not come looking for you .
oh please . another one .
what would you like ?
something pretty .
that is wonderful . where did you ever learn it ?
far away .
david .
who am i deceiving ?
state of grace and all that .
tradition .
not so scared .
perhaps not . you seem to have misplaced a private . no doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck .
no doubt .
you surprise me . eliminating a rival like that . such are the actions of a man of conquest . i was mistaken . years have turned the boy s fear into ambit ion .
you are wrong .
romirez understood . not you .
finish your prayers ?
finish yours ?
our common heritage . i am your only real friend , you know . the only one who truly understands you . i look forward to the day we meet again . and i kill you .
complete your inspection ?
they are nothing but boys . it will be a slaughter tomorrow .
i doubt much can change that . the enemy has five brigades waiting for us .
we need more time .
eat up dupont . it will probably be your last .
your name ?
i thought i gave orders the regiment was to drill .
staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break fast cooking .
what is your position ?
second musketeer .
i understand you joined up in bremen .
you seem to understand a great deal .
i am a major , private . you would do well remembering that when addressing me .
excuse me , sir . i thought we spoke as equals .
equals ?
wait . i think we understand each other .
we have no understanding .
help ? i have seen others help . somehow a head always ended up on the counter .
it can be different . it must be .
we must talk .
stay out of it .
do not threaten me , private .
do not turn your back on me .
you are really going to force this , are not you ?
you see major ? you are not so different . . .
ah , conor , how you look a man .
your grandfather wore that in his service to the king , and i to fight for the duke .
must he go ?
aye . it is his duty . all of ours .
but ian , he is still but a boy .
here . the hook should go just below the head , where the meat is toughest .
fish are creatures of habit . they like their food where they are used to it . at the top , hiding in old leaves .
where did you learn that ?
my father taught me .
your father must be smart .
i want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff .
figure she is with him ?
yeah .
we ran down that church hill info . she is right . there is no richard taupin .
any other i . d . s come up ?
should have seen him the first night . son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and did not even blink .
are you sure ?
will not know till the records department comes back with it this after noon . looks good though . they found the receipt in his townhouse . it was pretty smeared but had taupings father listed as a signatory .
round up who you can and put them on standby .
think we should call the local p . d . out there first ?
where !
i do not know .
smith . carl smith .
how many came ?
the last four .
and the bulgarian ?
he got him . he always does . eventually .
he knows i am here . how ?
answer me .
spare a chair ?
kahn ?
are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night ?
how are you ?
head still secure to the neck .
how did you find me ?
old habits die hard . waitress ! a round of nitzhic ! peasant drool , i know . but it is the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence .
what are you doing here ?
and have you something to settle with me ?
not tonight . tonight i have a drink with an old friend .
i will never forget the look on that papal commander s face when his heretic stronghold turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over neuvich .
neuvich , the clown of the crusades .
but then rides up pope pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross , climbs off his papal horse , draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on . and what did neuvich , dear dear drunken neuvich do ?
had a great swing with his blade . for a pope .
he found us even there .
i have not drunk this much since
i love zoos . ever since i was a kid .
i knew his great grandfather .
you are insane .
no , seriously . we used to shoot pool together in rangoon .
how do you do it , kahn ? how do you live so full of life for so long ?
tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have . all else is just marking time . you are marking time .
the pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth .
you are wrong .
long time .
you have been here from the start .
friend of yours ?
of sorts .
run !
you disappoint me . i thought you would finally gotten over that sort of thing .
leave her out of this .
that is the point ?
this is not done . get up .
that is the point ! you have me , finish it !
i have waited forever for this . you will not cheapen it , little boy .
tradition .
it is all we have .
perhaps miss cartwright would like to play .
leave her alone .
we have some unfinished business .
are you here ?
i want you to come to me .
and if i refuse ?
yes laddie , i have her .
this your present address ?
yes .
mr . taupin , what were you doing in that alley ?
i was walking by when i heard a shout . your men came right after .
did you know the victim ?
no .
his name was iman fasil if that jogs your memory .
it does not .
two days ago a bulgarian national was murdered the same way . he would also been in the country less than a week . what is your citizenship ?
do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh borhood at night ?
what are you getting at ?
what were you looking for ?
that is none of your business .
do you know what this is ?
i presume it is a sword .
a claymore to be exact . you would not know anything about it would you ?
your murder weapon ?
it was covered with mr . fasil s fingerprints , but none of his blood .
a mystery .
my condolences .
where were you tuesday night ?
home .
a neighbor saw your car leave .
look , i do not know what the hell you are up to , but i think i have got a pretty good idea .
do you ?
all i need is time .
ah steven , it is good to see you .
i only just heard of conor . i came up from catroch as soon as i could .
you are a kind man to be sure .
i thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family .
steven , conor did not die .
but i had heard his wounds were mortal .
when your father died i saw to it that the grounds were kept up .
the money in the estate was enough to cover your costs ?
you are one of william s kids , huh ?
his only kid .
sure take after him . never seen a father and son look more alike .
we were very close .
the resemblance is amazing .
when may i expect the cleaners ?
morning mr . north
same .
such a pretty day . if i live to be i will never tire of mornings like this . mind you i am now .
no .
yes sir . when you get older your priorities change . it is the simple things that count . without them growing old can be a very lonely thing .
nothing to be sorry about .
hello , harvard ! got anything new on the hanging ?
this is murphy . more slop on the hanging .
a double guard s been thrown around the jail , municipal buildings , railroad terminals , and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution .
ready ? the sheriff s just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the red army which is leaving moscow in a couple of minutes . up a dime .
the sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life , but he says nothing can interfere with his duty .
cannot you say hello to a fellow ?
are you back ?
no , just a farewell appearance , batting for sweeney . i am going into business for myself .
what doing ?
i am getting married tomorrow .
who is it ?
that is the idea of locking this ?
bensinger of the tribune .
ai not you got any more sense than to ? oh , h hello , mr . burns . why , quite an honor having you come over here .
hello , bensinger .
how do you mean ?
i was having a little chat about you just this afternoon with our mister duffy .
nothing ah detrimental , i hope .
i should say not ! that was one swell story you had in the paper this morning .
oh , did you care for the poem , mr . burns ?
the poem ? . . . the poem was great !
remember the ending ? and all is well , outside his cell , but in his heart he hears the hangman calling and the gallows falling and his white haired mother s tears . . .
heartbreaking ! how would you like to work for me ?
duffy ! i am sending bensinger over to see you . mervyn , is not it ?
no . roy . roy v .
of course ! roy bensinger , the poet . of course you would not know ! you probably never heard of shakespeare , either ! put mr . bensinger right on the staff . how much are you getting on the tribune , roy ?
seventy five .
let him have everything he wants . now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man . he hides , cowering . . . afraid of every light , of every sound . . . hears footsteps . . . his heart going like that . . . and all the time they are closing in . . . get the sense of an animal at bay !
sort of a jack london style ?
i got my rhyming dictionary in
i will keep you in mind .
au revoir , mon capitaine .
i will not be more than ten minutes , i promise you .
i said uh i said even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you .
do not be embarrassed , bruce . i heard it , but i just wanted to hear it again . i can stand being spoiled a little . the gentleman i am going to have a chat with did very little spoiling .
i would like to spoil him just once . sure you do not want me to go in with you ?
my job , bruce . i started it and i will finish it .
i suppose you are right but if it gets rough , remember i am here .
oh , it is not like that .
you know , hildy , he is not a bad fellow .
you are so nice , bruce , you think everybody else is .
oh , he is not the man for you . i can see that . but i sort of like him . got a lot of charm .
he comes by it naturally . his grandfather was a snake .
if anybody had told me i would be sitting at lunch with him but he swept me right off my feet .
too hot ?
say , that is happened to burns ? he looks sunk , does not he ?
i do not use my wife for business purposes , mr . burns !
wait a minute , bruce . that is commission on a , . policy ?
well , at his age , twenty payment life , a little over a thousand dollars .
and that is the matter with a thousand dollars ?
but
according to the budget , we laid out that is more than our food bill for a whole year . listen , bruce , i do not want walter burns to use me , but i am perfectly willing to use him . how long will it take to get him examined ?
about twenty five hundred dollars .
all right , dear .
wait a minute , bruce . have you got that money ?
the five hundred ? sure .
on second thought , would you let me have it ? i will get the tickets .
but
believe me , bruce , i know what i am doing . he would get you in a crap game
but i do not gamble , hilda !
i know a lot of men who did not do anything till they met walter burns . please , dear .
all right . one two three four five . five hundred . be careful , honey .
hildy johnson . . . oh , hello , bruce . have you got it ? is it certified ?
all right . i have done it . now , are you satisfied ?
that is the matter ?
i lost my wallet .
that is right here . gee , it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition .
yes , was not it ?
i cannot imagine who did it . i cannot think of any enemies i have .
i am sure you have not any .
for a minute , i thought maybe walter burns was at the back of it . but then i realized he could not have been .
oh , no . how could you ever think of such a thing ?
oh , i realized right away . he is really a very nice fellow , hildy i found that out .
yes , he is . . . look , bruce , we are taking that next train and when i say next train , this time i mean it !
did you finish the interview ?
no but i am sure it will be all right with walter .
but , gee , hildy he gave us that insurance business and you promised
hildy !
bruce ! ! how would you get out ?
not through any help of yours , hildy .
i waited and waited and then i had an idea and wired albany to send me a hundred dollars so i could get out on bail . . . i do not know what they will think they sent it to the police station !
we will explain the whole thing to them .
i know i got you into this , hildy , but it does seem to me that you cannot care much for me if you are willing to let me stay locked up for two hours .
oh , she was here .
where would she go ?
hildy ! where is mother ?
oh mother she i do not know where she went .
did you give her the money ?
no , i was going to give it to her but she left hurriedly .
then suppose you give me the money . four hundred and fifty dollars .
here it is , bruce . one two three four hundred and fifty dollars .
just a second , walter . here , bruce , here s the check . . . and , oh , bruce , here s your wallet . i got it back .
i am taking the nine o clock train , hildy . and you can meet us at the station .
mr . burns
i have just told you i was busy with mr . bruce baldwin !
you are bruce baldwin ?
yes !
this is a pleasure , mr . baldwin , and i am sorry about the mistake .

oh , i thought there was something funny . . . you see , bruce , you do not mind if i call you bruce , do you ? after all , we are practically related
mr . well no no not at all .
you see , my wife i mean , your wife that is , i mean hildy had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man .
oh .
but i see , she did not mean old in years . you always carry an umbrella , bruce ?
well , er it looked a little cloudy this morning .
attaboy ! come on , bruce .
where are we going ?
where are we going ? i am going to buy you two lunch did not hildy tell you ?
no she did not .
well , so you are getting married tomorrow , eh ? how does it feel , bruce ?
feels awful good . yes , sir we are taking the four o clock train to albany and tomorrow we will be married .
mother ? but your mother
no . my mother .
i know i was not a good husband , hildy , but you can always count on me .
well , i will try to give her one .
i know you will , bruce . are you going to live with your mother ?
just for the first year .
mighty nice little town , albany . they have got the state capitol there , you know .
how is business , bruce ?
well , albany s a mighty good insurance town . most people there take it out pretty early in life .
i sometimes wish i would taken out insurance but , of course , now it does not matter . still , i suppose it would have been the smart thing to do .
well , i honestly feel that way . i figure i am in one line of business that really helps people . of course , we do not help you much when you are alive but afterward that is what counts .
anything the matter ?
just what is the lowdown on williams ?
are you sure williams is not all there ?
all you have got to do is talk to him . but the mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re elected .
but could not you show the man was not responsible ?
how long would the interview take ?
oh an hour for the interview . another hour to write it .
i never knew hildy to be so determined before .
i do not know . this makes me feel funny .
why should not i make hildy my beneficiary ? i have got nobody else to leave it to .
i feel i ought to take care of her .
well , you will take care of her . after all , if that doctor s right , i am going to live for a long time yet . look , bruce , this is a debt of honor . i was a very bad husband hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she would wanted to , but she would not take any . she had it coming to her , but she was too independent .
well , i am independent , too .
figure it this way i ought to be good for twenty five years . by that time , you will probably have made enough so that the money will not mean anything . but suppose you have not made good do not you think hildy s entitled to a quiet old age without any worries ?
well , of course , if you put it that way .
and remember this , bruce ! i love her , too .
i am beginning to realize that .
and the beauty of it is she will never have to know till i have passed on . maybe she will think kindly of me after i am gone .
gee , you almost make me feel like a heel coming between you .
well , bruce , here you are certified and everything .
well , she will know some day .
do not want to forget this , you know . might start to rain again .
well , anyway , i know hildy s getting a good man .
well , i got to get back . you can find your way out , cannot you ?
oh , sure . well , thanks for everything .
do not thank me . i should thank you . so long .
hildy !
no i was just talking to one of the guys at the office .
and i will take that certified check , too . i have decided i can handle things around here . . .
i will see she is there , bruce , i promise you .
i know how you feel , bruce , but you have got to forgive her . she is only a woman , after all .
suppose she is i have feelings , too ! do you know where i have been for the last couple of hours ? locked up in a police station and she did not move to do anything about it .
ts ! ts ! ts !
and now i do not know where my mother is . she may be lost .
i will find her , bruce , if i have to put every detective in the city on the job . tell you what go over to the missing persons bureau and describe your mother . what does she look like ?
she is well , she is very motherly . that is about the best description i know .
oh , bruce , let me see that money hildy gave you .
the money ? why ?
there s a lot of counterfeit big bills going around .
oh , this is all right , bruce . i just wanted to be sure .
who do you think you are , breaking in here like this ?
if you have any accusations to make , hartman , make them in the proper manner . otherwise , i will have to ask you to get out .
you will ask me to what ?
get out !
i can explain that , hartman . when hildy told me she wanted to interview earl williams i thought it might be dangerous and i gave her a gun to defend herself .
you are barking up the wrong tree , hartman .
no ? well johnson , you are under arrest . you , too , burns .
who s under arrest ? you pimple headed , square toed spy do you realize what you are doing ?
i will show you what i am doing . burns , you are guilty of obstructing justice and so is the morning post . i am going to see that the post is fined ten thousand dollars for this .
you will see nothing of the kind , sheriff .
hartman , if you take this desk out of this building , i will put you behind bars .
you will , eh ? well , we will see about that . all right , boys . take it .
i am warning you it will be a federal offense . and you will be an accessory !
what about this , burns ? kidnapping , eh ?
call duffy !
no , you do not !
you are going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we are pulling your nose out of the feed bag .
that is this ?
does it ? you forget the power that always watches over the morning post .
duffy ! get liebowitz !
all the lawyers in the world are not going to help you !
this is the morning post you are talking to !
that is absurd on the face of it , mr . burns ! he is talking like a child .
out of the mouths of babes .
save that for the tribune .
what do you want ?
why , i am surprised , mr . burns . that is no way to talk to your wife even if she is no longer your wife .
hello , hildy !
how long is what ?
you know what . how long since we have seen each other ?
let s see . i was in reno six weeks then bermuda . . . oh , about four months , i guess . seems like yesterday to me .
maybe it was yesterday . been seeing me in your dreams ?
no mama does not dream about you any more , walter . you would not know the old girl now .
you are repeating yourself ! that is the speech you made the night you proposed . any time any place anywhere !
i notice you still remember it .
i will always remember it . if i had not remembered it , i would not have divorced you .
you know , hildy , i sort of wish you had not done it .
done what ?
divorced me . it sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself . it almost gives him a feeling he was not wanted .
holy mackerel ! look , walter , that is what divorces are for .
nonsense . you have got the old fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever till wouldeath us do part . why , a divorce does not mean anything today . it is only a few words mumbled over you by a judge . we have got something between us nothing can change .
i suppose that is true in a way . i am fond of you , walter . i often wish you were not such a stinker .
now , that is a nice thing to say .
well , why did you promise me you would not fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works ?
well , i meant to let you go but , you know , you never miss the water till the well runs dry .
a fellow your age , hiring an airplane to write hildy do not be hasty remember my dimple . walter . ! it held things up twenty minutes while the judge ran out to watch it .
well , i do not want to brag , but i have still got the dimple and in the same place i just acted like any husband who does not want to see his home broken up .
was it my fault ? did i know that coal mine was going to have another cave in ? i meant to be with you on our honeymoon , hildy honest i did .
all i know is that instead of two weeks in atlantic city with my bridegroom , i spent two weeks in a coal mine with john kruptzky age sixty three getting food and air out of a tube ! you do not deny that . do you ?
deny it ! i am proud of it ! we beat the whole country on that story .
well , suppose we did ? that is not what i got married for . that is the good of look , walter , i came up here to tell you that you will have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day sending twenty telegrams all the rest of it , because i am
let s not fight , hildy . tell you what . you come back to work on the paper and if we find we cannot get along in a friendly way , we will get married again .
what ? ! !
i have not any hard feelings .
walter , you are wonderful in a loathesome sort of way . now , would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what i came up here for ?
sure , come on . we will have some lunch and you can tell me everything .
i have a lunch date . i just want
you can break it , cannot you ?
no , i cannot .
sure you can . come on .
do not tell me what to do ! we are divorced i am a free woman . you are not my husband and you are not my boss ! and that is more , you are not going to be my boss .
what do you mean by that ?
just what i said . that is what i
you mean you are not coming back to work here ?
that is the first time you have been right today . that is what i
you have had a better offer , eh ?
you bet i have got a better offer .
well , go on and take it . work for somebody else ! that is the gratitude i get for
i know , walter , but i
what were you when you came here five years ago ? a little college girl from a school of journalism ! i took a little doll faced mugg
you would not have taken me if i had not been doll faced !
why should i ? i thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering .
listen , walter
i made a great reporter out of you , hildy , but you will not be half as good on any other paper , and you know it . you need me and i need you and the paper needs both of us .
well , the paper will have to learn to do without me . and so will you . it just did not work out , walter .
it would have worked if you would been satisfied with just being editor and reporter . but no ! you had to marry me and spoil everything .
i was not satisfied ! i suppose i proposed to you !
well , you practically did ! making goo goo eyes at me for two years till i broke down . and i still claim i was tight the night i proposed . if you would been a gentleman you would have forgotten all about it . but not you !
sweeney ! you cannot do that to me ! not today , of all days ! jumping jehosophat ! oh , no , sweeney . . . well , i suppose so . . . all right . if you have to , you have to . how do you like that ? everything happens to me with days in the year this has to be the day .
that is the matter ?
sweeney .
dead ?
not yet . might just as well be . the only man on the paper who can write and his wife picks this morning to have a baby !
sweeney ? well , after all , he did not do it on purpose , did he ?
i do not care whether he did or not . he is supposed to be covering the earl williams case and there he is waiting at the hospital ! is there no sense of honor left in this country ?
well , have not you got anybody else ?
there s nobody else on the paper who can write ! this will break me , unless hildy !
no !
you have got to help me , hildy .
keep away
it will bring us together again , hildy just the way we used to be .
that is what i am afraid of . any time any place anywhere !
do not mock , hildy , this is bigger than anything that is happened to us . do not do it for me ! do it for the paper .
get away , svengali .
if you will not do it for love , how about money ? forget the other offer and i will raise you twenty five bucks a week .
listen , you bumble headed baboon
all right thirty five , and not a cent more !
please ! will you just
great grief ! that is that other paper going to give you ?
i am not working for any other paper !
oh ! in that case , the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it . trying to blackjack
i tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing . i am getting married , walter , and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as i can get ! i am through .
get married all you want to , hildy , but you cannot quit the newspaper business .
you cannot sell me that , walter .
who says i cannot ? you are a newspaper man .
that is why i am quitting . i want to go some place where i can be a woman .
i know you , hildy , and i know what it would mean . it would kill you .
a journalist ! peeking through keyholes running after fire engines waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think hitler s going to start a war stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen ! i know all about reporters a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets , and for what ? so a million hired girls and motormengs wives will know that is going on ! no , walter , i am through .
where would you meet this man ?
bermuda .
bermuda . . . rich , eh ?
not what you would call rich . makes about five thousand a year .
that is his line ?
he is in the insurance business .
the insurance business ?
it is a good , honest business , is not it ?
oh sure , it is honest . but somehow , i cannot picture you with a guy who sells policies .
well , i can , and i love it ! he forgets the office when he is with me . he does not treat me like an errand boy he treats me like a woman .
he does , does he ? how did i treat you like a water buffalo ?
i do not know about water buffaloes , but i know about him . he is kind and sweet and considerate . he wants a home and children .
say , sounds more like a guy i ought to marry . that is his name ?
well , i will give you a hint . by tomorrow they will be calling me mrs . bruce baldwin .
tomorrow ? tomorrow . . . as quick as that ?
the quicker the better . well i finally got out what i came in to tell you . so long , walter , and better luck next time .
i wish you everything i could not give you , hildy .
thanks . . .
too bad i could not see this guy first . i am pretty particular about whom my wife marries .
well , he is waiting in the anteroom for me now .
say , could i meet him ?
oh , better not , walter . would not do any good .
you are not afraid , are you ?
afraid ? i should say not !
all right then , come on and let s see this paragon . is he as good as you say ?
then what does he want with you ?
now you got me .
you would not believe this , walter , but bruce holds the door open for me .
and he takes his hat off when he is with a lady .
what for ?
and when he walks with a lady , he waits for her !
allow me .
i suppose i cannot call this off without creating a scene but remember , it is your last fling .
well , i will tell you one thing , old man , she never looked at me the way she is looking at you .
i might have , walter , but you were never there .
here s luck to the bride and bridegroom .
what now ?
his wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord . they cannot even find him . i tell you , drink is the ruin of this nation .
you said it .
if he is nuts , why does not the state just put him away ?
because it happened to be a colored policeman .
the colored vote happens to be very important to the mayor of this town .
no , bruce , dear . do not you see ? this is a trick to get your sympathy . no , walter , i have been waiting for something like this but i was not sure when you would spring it . if you want to save earl williams life , you can interview him yourself . you are still a good reporter . bruce and i will be on that four o clock train and thanks just the same .
i am an editor . i know what ought to be written , but i cannot write it the way you could . it needs a womangs heart
why , walter , you are getting poetic !
how can you have any happiness after that ? all through the years you will remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours ! i tell you , earl williams face will come between you on the train tonight and at the preacher s tomorrow and all the rest of your lives !
what a performance ! bravo ! do not let him fool you , bruce it is only an act !
what do you mean , only an act ? have not you got any feeling ?
well , it is either an act on your part or a miracle on sweeney s .
what do you mean ?
i happen to know sweeney was married only three months ago . if he is got twins this morning , i claim it was done with mirrors .
all right , hildy , i am licked . but i will make you and bruce a business proposition .
we are not interested .
now you are talking !
you keep out of this . bruce , suppose you examine mr . burns in his office . i will get my bag and go over to the press room in the criminal courts building . you phone me as soon as mr . burns has given you his check . then i will go get the interview and you phone mother that we are taking the six o clock train . and no tricks , walter !
what tricks would i pull ?
what do you think i am a crook ?
yes and that is putting it mildly ! no certified check no story get me ?
all right . the check will be certified . want my fingerprints ?
exclusive ? that is great .
it cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of cooley .
never mind that . that is the story ?
never mind it ? that is not my money ! that is bruce s money !
you will get it . now that is the story ? i will have the paper send the money right down to you . i swear it on my mother s grave .
wait a minute . your mother s alive .
i meant on my grandmother s grave . do not be so technical , hildy . that is the story ? !
well , i am coming to it . it seems the professor had to have a gun to re enact the crime with and who do you suppose supplied it ? nobody else but that great thinker , sheriff hartman !
no kidding , hildy . say , this is not a rib ?
no , this is on the level , walter . i am not good enough to make this one up . the sheriff gave his gun to the professor , the professor gave it to earl , and earl gave it right back to the professor right in the stomach ! who ? no , egelhoffer was not hurt badly . they took him to the county hospital where they are afraid he will recover .
that is great work , hildy . . . huh ? oh , will you stop worrying about the money ? i will see you get it in fifteen minutes .
it better be fifteen minutes , because bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter s clicking away to beat the band .
walter ! d did you see that ?
yes . where is he ?
she jumped out of the window .
where do you think you are going ?
let go o me ! i have got to get bruce out of jail ! oh , walter , why did you have to do this to me ?
get bruce out of jail ! how can you worry about a man who s resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on ? hildy , this is war ! you cannot desert now !
oh , get off that trapeze ! there s your story ! smear it all over the front page earl williams caught by the morning post ! and take all the credit i covered your story for you and i got myself in a fine mess doing it and now i am getting out ! i know i told you that twice before today but this time i mean it !
you drooling idiot ! what do you mean , you are getting out ! there are three hundred and sixty five days in the year one can get married but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk ? once in a lifetime ! hildy , you have got the whole city by the seat of the pants !
i know , but
you know ! you have got the brain of a pancake ! that was not just a story you covered it was a revolution ! hildy ! this is the greatest yarn in journalism since livingstone discovered stanley for the new york herald !
wait a minute was not it stanley who discovered livingstone ?
do not get technical at a time like this ! do you realize what you have done ? you have taken a city that is been graft ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you are kicking em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that new york s having under la guardia ! we will make such monkeys out of these ward heelers next tuesday that nobody will vote for them not even their wives !
i would like to think .
well , think it then , because it is true ! we will crucify that mob . we are going to keep williams under cover till morning so the post can break the story exclusive . then we will let the governor in on the capture share the glory with him .
i get it !
you have kicked over the whole city hall like an apple cart . you have got the mayor and hartman backed against a wall . you have put one administration out and another in . this is not a newspaper story it is a career ! and you stand there belly aching about whether you catch an eight o clock train or a nine o clock train ! still a doll faced mugg ! that is all you are .
let me get at that typewriter and i will show you how a doll faced mugg can write !
attagirl ! why , they will be naming streets after you hildy johnson street ! there will be statues of you in the parks , hildy . the radio will be after you the movies ! by tomorrow morning i will betcha there s a hildy johnson cigar ! i can see the billboards now . light up with hildy johnson !
whoa wait a minute . we cannot leave williams here . one of the other fellows will
we are going to take him over to my private office . where is our phone ?
not if he is inside the desk . we will carry the desk over . give me duffy !
you cannot take that desk out . it is crawling with cops outside .
hildy !
huh !
get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load , will you ? snap into it !
how much do you want on it ?
all the words you have got .
can i call the mayor a bird of prey or is that libelous ?
how about the time he had his house painted by the fire department ?
for pete s sake , hildy , they are waiting for the rest of that story !
hildy !
listen , did you impress it on butch that i want him and his gang here right away ? you did ? every minute counts . all right . duffy s getting old !
well , keep going ! we want an extra out on the streets before it is too late !
where is bruce ?
bruce ? oh er he went out to get the tickets .
what tickets ?
railroad tickets .
is he coming back here ?
double crossing swine !
tear into it , will you ? do not sit there like a frozen robin !
i am finished .
bruce ought to be back by now . walter , you are not trying anything again , are you ?
where is mrs . baldwin ?
what did you do with her ?
what happened ?
where is she ? tell me !
do not tell me was she killed ?
it is fate , hildy . what will be , will be .
what am i going to say to bruce ? what will i tell him ?
if he really loves you , you will not have to tell him anything . snap out of it ! would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here ?
look at me , hildy
i am looking at you you murderer !
if it was my own mother , i would carry on ! you know i would . for the paper !
hello hello . . .
gimme western four five five seven .
who ? hello , butch ! where are you ?

i cannot hear . . . you got who ? speak up ! a what ? . . . you cannot stop for a dame now !
is this the community hospital ?
i do not care if you have been after her for six years ! butch , our whole lives are at stake ! are you going to let a woman come between us after all we have been through ?
hello , max , hildy johnson . was there an old lady ?
butch ! i would put my arm in fire for you up to here ! now , you cannot double cross me ! . . . she does ? all right put her on . i will talk to her . . . hello ! oh , hello , madam . . . now listen , you ten cent glamour girl , you cannot keep butch away from his duty . . . that is that ? you say that again and i will come over there and knock your eye out ! hello ? i will kill em ! i will kill both of em ! duffy ! mousing around with some big blonde annie on my time ! that is co operation ! duffy ! !

hello hello ! is this the lying in hospital ? did you have an auto accident in the last
will you come here ?
oh , i see . i beg your pardon .
when i am surrounded , with my back against the wall , you are not going to lay down on me , are you
hildy , you just cannot leave me out on a limb now . it it would not be cricket !
do not open that !
no , you do not ! walter !
no !
wait a minute ! let go there !
murder , uh ?
when did you deliver this first ?
which ought to be about three hours more , i would say .
just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment .
how was that for a tight squeeze ?
do not tell me you were worried !
worried ! i was petrified . were not you ?
uh uh . as long as we were in there together pitching they could not lick us . well , it is been a lot of fun .
in a way .
i mean working together . just like the old days . the things we have been through , hildy .
we have certainly been in some swell jams .
remember the time we broke into the d . a . s office , and copied fifi randell s diary ?
yeah . what about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory ? six scoop interviews !
yeah but that time we stole old lady haggerty s stomach off the coroner s physician . we proved she was poisoned though , did not we ?
we sure did , but we had to go in hiding for a week .
in the shoreland hotel . and our only chaperon was the poor old lady s stomach .
sorry , hildy . i did not mean to be making love to another mangs fiancee .
that is all right , walter . it is as much my fault as yours .
bruce is making the nine o clock train . i told him you would be on it unless you want to write this story yourself .
well , if it is my last story , i would like it to be a good one . but i guess i cannot , walter .
suit yourself , kid . this is not for me to decide . of course , you could make a later train and still be in albany tomorrow morning .
yeah . i suppose i could . but , walter
he is going to have you the rest of his life , hildy . cannot you give me another hour ?
i do not know what to do , walter .
flip a coin .
well what is it ?
hildy !
do not touch me ! i am not doing it for you !
then why are you doing it ?
the greatest yarn ever written by anybody . my hat s off to you , hildy !
thanks .
and what a way to quit . while you are still champion ! that is the way to leave , hildy !
yeah . only only i am not leaving , walter .
what do you mean ? bruce will be waiting for you in albany .
no , he will not . i wired him that i was not coming .
where would you wire him ?
on the nine o clock train . that is the one he took , is not it ?
sure .
it is awfully clear now . bruce needs a wife who can give him a home and affection and peace . i could not do that for him , walter . i am what you made me a cheap reporter who would give up her soul for a story ! . . . is that job still open ?
both jobs are open , hildy . the paper and being mrs . walter burns .
thanks , walter , but it is no good . we tried it .
sure , it was good it was wonderful ! only you expected it to be like other marriages . it cannot be like other marriages we are different ! we are a different world . look at what we went through today . i would not trade that for any honeymoon in the world . i bet you would not , either .
a fine honeymoon , with a murderer right in the boudoir ! and that other honeymoon in a coal mine !
that is what makes it romantic . every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is , and vice versa . but us you never know where i am and i am not sure where you are . that is romance !
well , maybe i would like to know just once !
hildy , if that is what you want , all right . we will even go to how about niagara falls ?
niagara falls ! walter , you do not mean that ?
sure i do . and i will tell you something else i would like a baby .
walter !
sure , i cannot last forever . i want a son i can train to take my place on this paper .
what would you do if it was a daughter ?
well , if she looked like you say ! my brains and your looks that might not be such a bad combination .
that is the matter with my brains ?
that is the good of arguing about something that probably does not exist ? look , hildy , i am proposing to you . what do you say ?
well , i would like to be lady like and think it over .
what !
that is what he said the last time . do not believe him , judge .
hildy , from this time on no tricks , no double crossing everything on the level !
how about bruce s ?
walter , you cannot do that !
hildy , darling !
yes hildy , darling . i am just a fool . that is what i am . i know what it is going to be like .
it will be heaven !
but , hildy i can explain
louie , take this lady over to polack mike s and lock her up . see that she does not take to anyone on the way .
are you referring to me , madam ?
come on , sheriff . we have got to get bail .
oh , dear ! oh , dear !
you grey haired old judas !
down western avenue . we were going sixty five miles an hour . you know what i mean ?
butter fingers ! i give you an old lady to take somewhere , and you hand her over to the cops !
what do you mean , i handed her ? the patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street .
now everything s fine . she is probably squawking her head off in some police station .
you stay here . i will find out everything .
anything you want , boss .
beat it out and get hold of some guys .
who do you want ?
you know me . the shirt off my back .
you got plenty of money ?
sure , boss .
i mean real money not counterfeit !
walter !
i am busy , duffy .
well , you are not too busy to know that the governor has not signed that reprieve !
what ?
and that means earl williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us !
you are crazy . where is mac ?
he is on my phone . he just called me .
do not blame me . i am city editor in name only . you do all the hiring around here .
here s that certified check , walter . i drew out my wife s savings , and if this is not back by i am a ruined man !
hello , hildy ! what are you doing around here ?
i want to interview earl williams , warden . how about a little service ?
say , is not this your twenty dollars ?
i think it is .
cooley , i want to talk to you .
there s money in it , cooley .
i cannot hildy . it means my job ! it means
how much ?
four hundred and fifty dollars . is it a deal ?
let s see the money .
the newspapers ! sheriff , they are the scum of modern civilization .
you said it !
they are always after me for interviews .
me , too .
of course , i sort of promised them i would give out a statement when i got through here . you do not mind ?
well , i do not know if that is ethical . you see , all statements are supposed to come from me .
we will have to satisfy them . what would you say to giving them a joint interview ? i could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects .
a joint interview , eh ? that might be all right . we could have our pictures taken together , doctor .
yes , shaking hands . i do not take a very good picture , though .
it does not matter . the publicity s the main thing .
i do not know
are you gentlemen all through with me ?
you know you are to be executed , mr . williams . who do you feel is responsible for that ?
the system . but i am not afraid to die , doctor . i am dying for what i believe .
i see . you realize , however , that you committed a crime ?
now , the sheriff will be mollie malloy , in whose room you were . you will be earl williams . and i will be the policeman . follow me , mr . williams ?
so now i say to you earl williams , you are under arrest ! and you point your gun at me .
well , it was not exactly that way
well , that about covers everything .
say , that is old prissy bensinger s desk .
i call . what you got ?
three bullets ! any good ?
who locked the door ?
open up there , will you !
hey !
kind of exclusive , ai not you ? we got calls to make , you know .
mollie malloy what happened to her ?
she looks as though she is going to come to .
give me a hand with her , will you ?
a fine bunch of reporters . biggest story in two years and they are too lazy to go after it .
better let us in on it , mollie .
that must be the tenth alienist they have had on williams . even if he was not crazy before , he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him . gimme the desk .
this egelhoffer s pretty good .
yeah ? what did he ever do for his country ?
trouble is , when the red menace shows up the sheriff will still be crying wolf !
well , a guy can win when hildy ai not around .
she says she is gonna write fiction .
you guys wanna play some more poker ?
boy , did you see her go ?
no , i tell you ! nobody knows where he got it .
the crime commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for williams capture .
so have we !
that is the dope , sheriff ?
say , hildy , if i know you , you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us . are you trying to scoop us or something ?
oh , you two are pals now i think you are right , endicott . mollie did give her some kind of story .
come on , you ! before we slap you down .
do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots ?
come on , pinky ! give em a little third degree .
hold the phone !
i will call .
goodbye , yonson .
what a chase !
you ai not getting out o here !
we know what you are up to .
how is everything , gus ?
oh i will take the same , i guess . and coffee .
little rum in yours , too ?
no just coffee , gus .
oh , i am sorry , gus ! my foot must have slipped .
gus , this
same way you did . through that gate .
i gave strict orders that nobody was to interview williams without my permission .
all right , then , i will just run the story that sheriff hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner . of course , with election coming , that might do you a lot of harm , but just as you say .
now , wait a minute ! i am not afraid of anything . what were you going to write about williams ?
oh , nothing much . just that the state had proved he was sane and he admits it himself . if you do not want me to run it
no , thanks sheriff . i am leaving town tonight .
you ought to stay over . you always wrote a good hanging story , hildy .
just a minute , johnson !
take your paws off me !
let me go ! fellows , something s happened to my mother in law .
i do not know anything , i tell you . there s been an accident .
johnson , there s something very peculiar going on .
you can send somebody with me if you do not believe me !
i was not born yesterday . now the boys tell me you and this mollie malloy
johnson , i am going to the bottom of this . what do you know about williams ? are you going to talk or are not you ?
what do i know about williams ?
where would you get this ?
i have got a right to carry a gun if i want to .
he went over to the hospital to call on professor egelhoffer .
what ?
he is harmless .
do not take any chances . shoot through the desk .
that is murder !
if the mayor wants me , he knows where i am .
this tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of sheriff hartmangs bombing squad .
what went off ?
four of mr . hartmangs deputy sheriffs were rushed to the hospital
a fine fair weather friend you are !
the names are merwyn d . mayor , who is the mayor s brother in law
after all i have done for you
where is he ?
i am sheriff hartman . you want me ?
for who ?
read it ! insane , he says . he knows very well that williams ai not insane !
well , wait a minute , will you ? i am in conference .
just one second
pete , i want to talk to you !
i ai not got time , fred , honest . i will see you after .
did you actually give williams that gun ?
the professor asked me for it i thought it was for something scientific !
now , listen , fred . just give me a few hours before you make any decisions . i will get results . i am doing everything humanly possible . i have just sworn in four hundred deputies .
four hundred ! do you want to bankrupt this administration ?
i am getting them for twelve dollars a night .
twelve dollars ! for those rheumatic uncles of yours ? out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it ?
pete , you are through !
what do you mean through ?
i mean i am scratching your name off the ticket tuesday and running czernecki in your place . it is nothing personal . and , pete it is the only way out . it is a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make .
fred !
now , pete ! please do not appeal to my sentimental side .
fred , i do not know what to say . a thing like this almost destroys a mangs faith in human nature .
i wish you would not talk like that , pete .
our families , fred . i have always looked on bessie as my own sister .
that gives you an idea of what i am up against !
williams ai not a red , and you know it !
well , there s a lot of communistic sympathizers around
i know it ! but they have got nothing to do with this case ! do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang earl williams we are going to lose em ?
the governor gave me his word of honor he would not interfere . two days ago !
pure politics !
dementia praecox oh h h !
we got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this . what will we tell em ?
tell em the party is through in this state on account of you .
ah , fred hello . . . this is hartman
and you can tell em as an afterthought that i want your resignation now !
sssh . wait , fred . what ? . . . where ? . . . where ? holy moses !
what is it ?
they got him ! wait a minute hold the wire . they got earl williams surrounded the riot squad has in his house .
tell em to hold the wire .
i did . hold the wire .
no do not out me off .
hold your horses will you , olsen ? hurry up , fred !
we will fix that , too .
all right . tell em to shoot to kill .
what ?
shoot to kill , i said .
i do not know , fred . there s that reprieve if they ever find out .
nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered . now , do as i tell you .
hello , olsen . . . listen . . . shoot to kill . . . that is the orders pass the word along . . . no ! we dont want him ! and listen , olsen , five hundred bucks for the guy that does the job . . . yes , i will be right out there . well , i hope that is the right thing to do .
now take that guilty look off your face , pete and stop trembling like a horse .
fine work , pete ! you certainly delivered the goods . i am proud of you .
look kind o natural , do not they , fred ?
a sight for sore eyes !
aiding an escaped criminal ! and a little charge of kidnapping i am looking into . but that is the jail ! there must be somebody there !
who is this man ?
you drunken idiot ! arrest him ! the idea of coming here with a cock and bull story like that !
that is a lie ! !
take those handcuffs off our friends , pete . that was not at all necessary .
walter , i cannot tell you how badly i feel about this . there was no excuse for hartwell to fly off the handle .
and so do i !
fine , thanks , sheriff .
that is good , earl . oh , they have got another alienist to see you . he ought to be here any minute . do not go to sleep , will you ?
i will not .
i hope you are pretty nearly through with me , doctor , i am getting a little fatigued .
got you , williams !
let him out of here , lieutenant .
but , hildy , i cannot . he is accused of stealing a watch . and they found the watch on him .
and who accused him ? diamond louis ! one of the worst crooks in town ! why do not you arrest louis instead of innocent people that he frames ?
now , hildy
do not hildy me ! are you going to let him out ?
i cannot .
all right . you cannot . but tomorrow the post will run the story of that roulette game on rd street that your brother in law runs . and we will print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it !
now , hildy , do not be hasty ! i cannot let him out .
you can let him out on bail , cannot you ?
five hundred dollars .
you will take fifty and like it !
oh , i ai not doing that any more . i am retired . i am one of you fellas now a newspaper man .
wait a minute , walter . you cannot do that !
where is the old lady ?
we run smack into a police patrol . you know what i mean ? we broke it in half !
i am telling you . can you imagine bumping into a load of cops ? ! they come rolling out like oranges !
what did you do with her ?
search me ! when i come to i was running down thirty fifth street .
you were with her . you were in the cab , were not you ?
nobody s going to rush me into anything ! you keep away from me !
gentlemen of the press ! always picking on somebody who cannot defend himself the littler the better .
phone for you , hildy .
who is it ?
oh , some insurance man . are you in ?
there goes another scrub lady .
well , anyhow , i will not be covering stuff like this any more .
it is getting so a girl cannot step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies . hello , post . . . mr . walter burns , please .
well , hildy , we were only saying that a swell reporter like you would not give this up so easily .
hello , mr . burns . yes , she is still here .
any news ?
you fight it cut .
i do not know why you boys are so good to me .
your poker s improved a lot , hildy . lend me two bucks , will you ?
certified , eh ? who is it your milkman ?
but , bruce , do not keep it in your wallet ! . . . well , you see there s an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you you put in the lining of your hat . that brings you good luck for ten years .
say , i have been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that . where would you get it ?
hello , hildy . i thought you were gone .
did you get that , hildy ?
if walter burns calls , hold the wire for me , will you ? i will be right back .
okay . forget it .
look out , you
have you got my dough ?
oh , sure . the boss sent me over with it . four hundred dollars , was not it ?
four hundred and fifty and i will cut your throat if you try any tricks !
all right , all right . you cannot blame a guy for trying , can you ?
come on with that money !
first you got to sign a receipt .
where is the money ?
keep your shirt on . i got it right here . one hundred two hundred three hundred four hundred and fifty . now sign .
here !
thanks . so long , hildy !
so long , nothing ! where is bruce baldwings wallet ?
huh ?
none of that innocent stuff , you double crossing hyena ! you stuck bruce baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch , and you frisked his wallet ! now , give me that wallet or i will stick you in jail and it will not be on any phony charge either ! it will be for life !
you know it is !
i did not frisk him . he must have dropped it in burns office . i did not know whose it was .
no and you do not know that your cheap boss has had mr . baldwin arrested again do you ?
kings and sixes .
that is good .
any dope yet on how he got out ?
hildy , i thought you were gone
well i was going , but mollie fainted away and i thought i ought to do what i could .
hiding him where ?
mother !
do not you mother me ! playing cat and mouse with my poor boy ! keeping him looked up making us miss two trains and supposed to be married tomorrow !
mother , i can explain everything . i will go with you in five minutes and
i do not know what she is talking about . i never said any such thing .
mother !
that man there !
i could not plead insanity , because you see i am just as sane as anybody else .
you did not mean to kill that policeman ?
of course not . i could not kill anybody it is against everything i have ever stood for . they know it was an accident . they are not hanging me for that they are hanging me for my beliefs .
what are your beliefs , earl ?
they are very simple . i believe in the golden rule . i am not the first man to die for preaching it . but if they would only listen to it we could have a fine , decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things .
how would you go about applying the golden rule , earl ?
i would do away with the profit system and have production for use only . there s enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we would use some sense .
production for use only . well , maybe that is the answer .
it is the only answer . everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose , we could solve all our problems . food was meant to be eaten , not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved clothing was meant to be worn , not piled up in stores while people went naked . does not that make sense ?
a gun ? why to shoot , of course .
is that how you came to shoot the policeman ?
sure . you see , i would never had a gun in my hand before and i did not know what to do with it . well , when i get stuck , i know that there s an answer for everything in production for use . so it came to me in a flash that is a gun for ? to shoot ! so i shot . simple is not it ?
very simple , earl .
there s nothing crazy about that , is there ?
no , earl , not at all . who sent you the flowers , earl ?
miss mollie malloy . she is a wonderful person .
is not that her picture ?
do not forget about production for use .
you are not going to phone anybody where i am .
you are not going to shoot me , earl . i am your friend , remember ? i have got to write that story about your production for use .
earl , you do not want to hurt your friends , do you ?
maybe you are my friend and maybe you are not but do not come any nearer . you cannot trust anybody in this crazy world . say , i will bet i could shoot you from here .
sure you could , earl but you would not want to do that , would you ? you would not want to kill anybody .
earl , there s just one thing i ought to clear up for the interview .
that is that ? only you are getting too near . i do not trust anybody .
i do not blame you , earl . if i were in your place i would not trust anybody , either .
earl , you must never do that again .
oh , i am awful tired . i could not go through another day like this .
do not talk too loud .
waking me up in the middle of the night talking to me about things they do not understand . calling me a bolshevik . i am an anarchist . it is got nothing to do with bombs . it is the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom . you see that , do not you ?
quiet , mollie , quiet !
do not cry , mollie , there s nothing to cry about .
how would you get here , earl ?
stop screaming , mollie or we are sunk . i am trying to think of something before those reporters get back .
what good will it do ?
come on , mollie . this is no place for you .
they are not human !
they are newspaper men , mollie . they cannot help themselves . the lord made them that way .
where are they gone ? you know where they are ?
they got him surrounded some place gonna shoot him like a dog !
mollie , they have not got him . you gotta help me , mollie ! we have got to do something !
that is that ?
quiet , mollie !
they will get him ! they will get him !
i am coming ! keep dead quiet . do not even breathe .
that is the idea ?
hey
are you all right , now ?
what do you want ?
i am a messenger at the state house . this is from the governor .
that is from the governor ?
they were all standing around when he wrote it . it was after they got back from fishing .
get the governor on the phone !
you cannot get him on the phone . he is out duckshooting now .
now , listen ! you never arrived here with this reprieve . get it ?
yes , i did , just now . do not you remember ?
how much do you make a week ?
huh ?
how much do you make a week ? that is your salary ?
who ? me ?
now , listen . there s a fine opening for a fellow like you in the city sealer s office .
the what ?
the city sealer s office !
you mean here in the city ?
why not ?
i could not work in the city . you see , i have got my family in the country .
but you could bring em in here ! we will pay all your expenses .
no , i do not think so .
for heavengs sake , why not ?
i got two kids going to school there , and if i changed them from one town to another , they would lose a grade .
no , they would not they would gain one ! and i guarantee that they will graduate with highest honors !
this puts me in a peculiar hole .
no , it does not . now , remember you never delivered this . you got caught in the traffic , or something . now , get out of here and do not let anybody see you .
but how do i know . . . ?
come in and see me in my office tomorrow . that is your name ?
pinkus .
you forgot to tell me what a city sealer has to do .
i will explain it tomorrow !
is it hard ?
get out of here !
they would not take it .
here s the picture of my wife .
a very fine looking women .
she is good enough for me ! and if i was to go home and tell my wife
if you ask us , no . if you ask the state alienists , the answer is yes .
well , well miss mollie malloy .
look out !
sure , mollie , you never looked better in your life .
get the cops , somebody .
there she is !
that is your hurry ?
williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered
well williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he is got to save the world . only he makes his speeches , usually , on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it . well , the cops let him alone as much as they can because he is harmless and they are kinda sorry for him . but one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a veterangs parade and the cops chase him . he gets scared and goes into hiding . come in , dave schwartz .
baldwin his name is .
who ? hildy johnson ? she just stepped out . she will be back in a second . who ? oh , mr . baldwin . well , if you will hang on a minute , she ought to be right in . all right .
baldwin . the blushing bridegroom himself .
that is he want ?
the door was locked .
that is that ?
henry chapmangs daughter . it was sheila . i remember her from last year .
can i try ?
never let a rat creep up on you .
that was a googly !
i know .
you are a dark horse , bowling googlies at your age . toss me up another .
want to know why they are called faith , hope , grace and charity ?
why ?
this is going too far , young man .
but grandpa , you said . . .
give him the you know what .
you miserable little tripe hound . i am the one who should be fed up , sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school .
i have to live in rosehill avenue as well .
only till they get you into the local school .
with mrs . evans . i hate her .
it is true .
grandpa , if you think of something hard enough , can you make it happen ?
pauline s mum got killed .
no , she did not .
what are you doing here ? this is our territory
i never was .
i know a secret .
that is that ?
the germans are dropping men on bomb sites .
my uncle s in the war office . he said , do not go on the bomb sites . boys are going missing all the time .
you want to join our gang ?
i do not mind .
do you know any swear words ?
yes .
well go on then . you cannot join if you cannot answer .
that word is special . that word is only for something really important . now , repeat after me . . . bugger off .
bugger off .
sod .
sod .
bloody .
bloody .
now put them together . bugger off , you bloody sod .
bugger off , you bloody sod .
they pulled them up from all the crossroads , so when the germans land they will lose their way .
will not they have maps ?
he is never going to come back . he is gone off to be a soldier and mummy does not even know .
it does not matter , i can drive the car home .
you would not .
would .
you could not .
go and ask her if she wants to play .
ask her yourself .
tell them about pauline s mum .
bruce , look ! dad got some german jam .
i suppose they are still learning , that is why they keep moving about .
it is easy . i have done it .
who with ?
pauline .
i did see them . i did .
you are the biggest fibber .
the next one is ours . either it hits us or it goes past us .
. . . and four and five . . .
please god . not on us . drop it on mrs . evans . she is a cow .
cannot we just see the end ?
they have got the real thing outside .
mind that shrapnel dawn thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in bill s face .
i am starting my own collection .
well , i am not having any . even if it is not poisoned . i do not think it is right . it is not patriotic .
you do not like jam . you hate jam . you never eat jam .
you did that for me , and on the last day of your holidays ?
well , for the baby , really .
crocodiles ! aah !
but dad , it is the news .
now , the googly looks like a leg break , but it is really an off break . got it ? like this .
it is like telling fibs .
you said that last year , dad .
that is that ?
big berthas , shelling france . twenty five mile range , they have .
wow !
they send over a few every day , to let them know we are still here . each shell costs as much as a ford .
who pays for them ?
it was great for me , how was it for you .
a bit too quick .
well . now we can do it slow . are those some kind of stockings you are wearing ?
they might be .
take it away . i know your husband s been away a long time , but . . . .
boy , that was some air raid .
air raid ?
what is it ?
we are not supposed to say , but we are being shipped out tomorrow .
where ?
i do not know ?
you do , you do . you are just not saying .
you expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring ? and you will meet some french girl who can speak your own language . no thank you !
could you seal it over with hot pitch , clive ? caulk it like the hull of a ship .
. . . it was a toss up . his company went to india , mine went to france . flip of a coin .
. . . two indians to fan me all night . the heat .
and jim .
root it out clive . . . the thought of it , before it takes hold .
weeds will grow , mac .
consider grace , the kids . i love them like my own . and you .
you are a mug , clive . we did our bit in the last lot .
what did we know ? we were seventeen .
what kind of war is this mac ? up there in cumberland , we never see an air raid . the worst problem i have is getting a new typewriter ribbon . when i rode in against the turks , i knew what it was about .
what about it ?
rosehill avenue . no roses . no hill . and it is certainly not an avenue .
why not ?
you need trees for an avenue .
there was talk of planting some when we first came .
how is your war , mac ?
never done better . on the fiddle . like everyone else .
except the servicemen .
naturally .
i do not understand . is there any point to it ?
you always were , clive . steady the buffs .
do not panic ! keep your head !
so you are going to be a grandfather .
and i am still just a lad myself .
here s to music . and absent friends .
and absent bridegrooms !
no turks .
we did not know that . it was a suicide mission . machetes against artillery . volunteers only .
we all had to write a last letter home .
has sue got it right ?
that is that ?
you joined up .
oh , that .
and that is that ?
we do not know anything about it
well , it is off ration . we know that .
well ?
it looks . . . . foreign .
taste it . why do not you taste it ?
you mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission ?
that is it .
why did not they say that before you started ?
i was not too old when i started the course . i was too old when it finished .
what are you going to be then ?
when do you think you will get leave again ?
i am glad you did not send them to your aunt .
i have had a letter from her . they have moved house .
i have found a bungalow to rent up the towpath , clive . i never want to leave the river again . the children have had such a wonderful summer .
i doubt if a few bombs would wake up dawn on a sunday morning .
this phoney war get s on my nerves . if we are going to have a war , i wish they would get it started .
you know it ? it must be an old one .
ancient . have you finished your homework ?
he always knows .
what would we do if a german came into the house ?
do not be silly , dawn .
tell me the truth . you had to get married , did not you ? because of me .
the ideas you get in your head .
i will not have this vulgar talk in my house .
and where do you think you are going ?
out .
you go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick .
i want him . i want him so much . i will kill myself if i cannot have him .
you better bring him home , if you really love him . do not kill love . you will regret it for the rest of your life .
what is it , pet ?
he is being posted . i was terrible to him .
what did he say ?
he said i was right . i should not wait for him . i was better to make a clean break .
i think it is very sensible in the circumstances .
i do not believe this is happening to me .
it looks a bit fishy to me .
now take deep breaths , and push .
is it peace in out time ?
no , mother ! it is war ! war !
did they say how long it would take to get new ration books , grace ?
up to six weeks , i think .
. . . such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers . all the punts lit up with chinese lanterns . like fireflies . and the gramophone going on one of the boats . always the charleston , the charleston , the charleston . oh , you girls .
it was the best time of his life .
i cannot do it . that is the point ?
please yourself . let them go , if they want .
it seems to have survived .
mac , that was wonderful . i have not been to a concert since . . .
. . . since i used to take you to the proms ?
remember this beach , mac ? all those summers . out two families , together .
mac , did you ever find out who molly went off with ?
she said , i know you love me , mac , but you have never loved me enough .
it is all better left unsaid , grace .
you were never apart , you and clive . he kept asking and asking . and i waited and waited for you to say something . and you never did .
he could always make me laugh .
we did the decent thing .
this war s put an end to decent things . i want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once , hold nothing back .
we cannot change that is past . not even the war can do that .
bless you , mac . what would i have done without you ?
you might still have a house .
i wish it could all have been different .
to mary mcdonald , thelma richardson , bobo hinds , lily sanderson . . . . . . little sarah whats it , now there was a spirit . and marjorie anderson .
father , that is enough now
what did i do to deserve this ?
you married that fool , clive , that is what . never mind , you can stay with us .
what can you do with four daughters , i asked myself , a string quartet was all i could come up with . they hated me for making them learn .
it is not fair on them . it is selfish to keep them with you .
it is so far way . i could not bear it .
i did not mean it like that , grace . why does it always come out wrong ?
god , how i hate all this scrimping and squalor .
i do not know how you cope , grace . three kids , army pay . on your own .
molly !
you are having me on , molly .
am i ? maybe i am .
you have been drinking . your tipsy .
i am so glad you could come . here we are , all together again .

that is this ?
how long have you been running this place ?

shit , i do not remember exactly . i took over for my pa just after the duke nabbed the oscar .
the duke ?
yeah , my pa was not right in the head after that .
you mean john wayne ?
hell , boy there some other duke you know about ? a great american .
yeah , i was never that big of a western fan . i like science fiction .
i figured that much . why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for ?
you see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions . you know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country .
i do not drive cross country .
but if you did .
i do not .
but suppose for a second you did .
y all find us country people real funny like do not ya . . . well , god damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits , i ze a gotta get me some schooling .
no , no i think it is really interesting .
really ? huh , i thought for sure you would say lynette fromme . she is got that snooty vibe i know you dig .
sqeaky ! no way , she ai not that hot .
she is pretty cute .
yeah but , she reminds me of this chick that i remember from fourth grade . . . called a . . . shit , what did we call her ? oh yeah , patty pee pee pants . . . when ever she got called on by miss chumski , this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling .
there always one kid with no bodily controls . we had this dude , jeff baxter , he was a puker . the fucker would just sit there puke all over himself .
better than pissing . . . anyway so , that is your choice ?
if we are talking cute . . . like regular cute , i would say leslie van houton , but cute ai not hot .
yeah , no shit .
as far a hot . . . goes i gotta go with . . . ruth ann moorehouse .
oh yeah , i forgot about her . she was pretty hot .
fuck yeah , she is . i would join a cult to get some of that . . . and the best part is she did not try to kill the president or nothing , so that baggage ai not hanging around .
i thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution .
i will let it slide , she was only seventeen .
dude , talk about baggage , that ai not no carry on shit , that is some heavy duty samsonite shit .
yeah , i guess . . . hot chicks are always nuts .
hold on , i have heard this before . . . but i cannot remember the end .
so , the guy goes to hell and the devil says , do you smoke ? the guy say , yeah . . . the devil say , great cause tuesday is cigar night , sweetest cuban cigars you ever had .
shit , we really need to find some gas .
then the devil asks , do you drink ? guy says , yeah . . . devil say , wonderful , wednesday is free drinks night , best booze you ever had . . . all made from the finest stuff .
yeah .
then the devil says , are you gay ? guy says , fuck no . . . devil says , well then , i guess you are gonna hate thursdays .
oh yeah , i remember now .
yeah , no shit i just told ya . hey , you think this place called alien ed s ufo welcoming center is still around ? it says , where the fact is separated from the fantasy .
i dunno . . . we will ask around as we get closer . man , i really do not want to run out of gas out here in the middle of petticoat junction , man .
do not panic yourself , way too much caffeine guy . . . i see a sign . captain spaulding s museum of madmen and monsters . . . cool . also . . . fried chicken and . . . gasoline . . . next exit .
perfect .
i will pump the gas . go inside and see if it is worth thinking about .
holy crap . you gotta see this place . it is awesome .
how awesome ?
really fucking awesome .
wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome ?
keep straight on this road here .
how much further ?
i am not exactly sure . . . it looks close . did we pass an abandoned school bus yet ?
come on , we need something like this . it could be the real deal . it is too far out of the way to come back to .
it is a hitchhiker .
she looks like she stinks .
that reminds me of a film i saw once of a guy who got out of his car at lion country safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions .
oh yeah , i heard about that . i always thought it was bullshit .
what was that ?
ok , let s relax . i will check it , maybe i am wrong . do not everybody freak out just yet .
i will help ya .
i hope you fixed the spare like i asked ya .
yeah , i fixed it . well , i ai not . . . um , i cannot remember . i think i took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back .
jesus christ , jerry .
well , technically i did what ya said .
tire s fucking gone crap on us , man . there s no saving it now .
do not forget the flashlight , it is pretty dark out there .
thanks .
oh , do not worry she did not get offended by what i said . you two got to lighten up . . . right , bill ?
whatever , at this point all i care about is food . i am starving and i got a fucking killer headache .
hey , i asked you if you wanted some chicken .
did not look like chicken to me , more like fried pussy cat .
i cannot believe what i am seeing .
almost there .
i like sleep .
honk at him . scare him .
fuck ! we are fucked !
yeah , maybe r . j . could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage .
that is he so excited about ?
just grin and bear it .
shit , i am all for being a sport , but this is ridiculous .
yeah , i would say at this point all we can do is just wait it out . there s nothing else .
do not look back , just get in the car .
we will need pictures of the inside too .
well , do not even think about playing the good samaritan , there s way too many psychos wandering loose these days .
should we stop ?
we cannot leave her out here in the rain . . . maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area .
sounds like a magical trip through the heartland .
why are we stopping ?
go around him .
there s not enough room .
hey , he moved .
well , i got some bad news and some bad news .
fine . i will go straight .
what !
forget it . i will just go .
screw that , no way , i ai not letting you go by yourself .
i hope to christ she does not expect us to wear these things .
check this out .
this is starting to make me real uncomfortable .
how much is a person supposed to stand ?
quiet .
what are you doing !
i gotta open the gate .
drive through it !
officers , officers what can i do for you today ? i ai not fried up the birds yet . . . if that is what you are ring a ding dinging about .
what i need are some answers .
well , i will try but i do not know nothing about nobody . i am a guy who likes to mind his own business , if ya get what i am saying .
come on , get with the facts .
hmmmmmmmmm ?
what would you see , who was she with , where were they going ?
and . . .
and i gave em directions out there , up by the old farm row . . . i figured that is the harm . stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit .
is that all . . . think real hard .
yeah , they were not here but a few minutes , did not really have time to get as up close and personal as i do with most of the assholes that wander through here .
how is about you give me those same directions .
yeah , yeah , sure . you do not have to get all true grit all over my ass . . . i will give m to ya . . . you can knock yourself silly for all i care .
i . . . i got back a stack today . some nice shots . see , a good topless june wilkinson . . . unfortunately she personalized it . . . to stucky , love june .
hmmmmm .
shit , this ai not worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it . i was a fixing on trading it to jackie cobb .
the retard over at molly s fruit stand .
fascinating .
that kid is one horny retard .
christ , ai not they all . all them retards wanna do is fuck and eat .
well , yeah . . . i think that if you knew him . . . i mean if you would understand his urges , shit the guy s like forty or something .
worse than a fucking rabid baboon .
yeah , i guess , you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes .
what ?
yeah , does not hurt himself , just spins it around next to his eyeball .
i am sure that ai not the only place he is sticking those pencils .
naw , he do not do anything else with em , but he did get caught once with a planet of the apes doll hanging out his asshole .
goddamn .
had to take him to the hospital . kid had dr . zaius stuck half way up his butt , could not get it out .
i always loved that mute broad that chuck heston was shacking up with .
nova , yeah she looked pretty sweet .
yeah , now there s the perfect woman .
ya hear me ? you bust that crapper and i will beat your ass .
fuck your grandmother .
huh ? oh , hi . you really do not have a phone ?
no , he is just joking . we do not really have any plans other than spending the night at my dad s house . . . . . . which is where we were headed when our car broke down .
that is nice .
how long is that gonna take ?
tiny ai not got no car , he ai not even got a bicycle .
you sure you do not need any help in there ?
you will have to forgive tiny , he cannot hear so much .
oh .
yeah , my poor baby . it is his daddy s fault . i mean earl was a good man . . . i mean he never hit me or nothing , but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all .
what happened ? oh , i am sorry , it is none of my business .
huh ?
great , you are back . let s go . we already paid for the tickets .
tickets for what ?
this is not everything . get ready for this . . . there s a museum of murder and mayhem .
aw , come on . it will be fun .
ugh , that is that smell ?
hey , maybe she knows where this is ?
fuck , it is freezing .
hey , listen to this . . . i think this is related to our dr . satan .
oh , yeah .
yeah , in this book there s a chapter called self made freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show . it mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of borneo and shit like that , but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm less wonder .
yeah , so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree ?
it says , records show that ellie thompson was born in of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings , until such time that she was placed in the care of the willows state mental facility .
so .
now she was put in the nuthouse in at the age of .
why ?
blah , blah , blah . . . it does not say , but she was released sometime in , only to reappear as ellie bogdan , the arm less wonder . says she , criss crossed the united states constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in .
yeah ?
these dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved dr . satan working at the looney bin . i will bet he amputated her arms .
so what ?
i do not know , i just thought it was interesting .
you know what jerry , who really cares at this point ?
yeah , jerry , she said some pretty fucked shit to us .
when ?
hey , nice outfit billy bob .
thanks for coming to get us . little brother almost scared us to death .
thank you .
really , now is not the time to make waves .
hey , i am just waiting for cousin itt to show up .
what are you laughing at ?
i do not know , i think he is funny .
you gotta be kidding me . this chick is wasted .
we have got get out of here , we got get out of here .
think , think . try to open the lid , try to kick a hole in the wood .
i cannot . . . i cannot move my arms . i hurt so much .
that was good babe , just keep doing that .
that is not me . i did not . . . i am not doing that .
someone is out there . . . . . . help , we are in here !
hello . . . . . . hey denise . . . what , that is wrong , did you break down ?
no , nothing like that . . . yeah , we are gonna be a little late . we stopped for gas at this place called capt . spaulding s outside of ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing , so we are kind of behind schedule .
oh yeah , yeah i have driven by that place before . i seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place .
yeah , well he is still here . i think him and jerry are fast becoming buddies , you know jerry . . . yeah , he is gotta see everything . . . yeah , i know . . . thinks there s some unsolved mystery around every corner .
well , do not take too long , the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix . . . i know , i know i forgot to mention that halloween falls on a school night , so they are trick or treating tonight . . . i got the joint decked out this year , built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid .
hopefully i can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home . . . yes , dad i am kidding .
come on sleeping beauty , time to go to work .
sleeping .
rise and shine .
no please , let me sit this one out .
let s go . you are the one who wanted to be a photographer .
i resign .
too late . you are in for life , let s move it out private shutterbug .
christ , i hope this is not more crappy folk art . it is so quaint . . . it is so primal . . . it is so crap .
aw , it ai not crap . . . it is . . . cute . . . . and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin can mona lisa ?
i swear i have aged five years since this trip started .
tell me about it .
god , i hate falling asleep in the afternoon . now i will be up all night . . . . . . ugh , my back is killing me .
it will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate . this trip is fun , but it is starting to get brutal .
yeah , i hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady s place . watching her dance around with those ratty looking animals was ridiculous .
i know , that was some crazy shit . i never in a million years would have believed it if i had not seen it .
a decent meal every once in a while would not hurt either , this road food is crap .
if i never eat at another waffle house again , i can die a happy girl .
scattered , smothered and covered .
geez , he never gets tired does he .
never . i swear to god he never sleeps , he goes to bed after me , wakes up before me . he is always working on .
let s just skip it . it is probably nothing anyway .
stick her in the front , if you want to pick her up so bad . she is soaked .
do not even say it .
you got to be fucking joking .
i think i am going fucking crazy .
she said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that .
how long has it been ?
what was that ?
what ? i did not hear anything .
i do not hear anything .
shhhhhh , quiet .
i still do not .
jesus christ .

a vehicle registered to a william s . hudley .
holy jesus , somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing .
yeah , no mercy here .
recover any bodies ?

just in the wrong place at the wrong time .
that is the understatement of the year .
god damn .

what would ya got there ?
keys .
well christ boy , do not stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree .
huh ?
open up the trunk .

his name is rufus , rufus jr . , but we all call him r . j .
oh , right .
what do they call you , sweety ?
so , what brings you kids way out here , ai not you got something better to do for halloween than wander around out here in the sticks ?
well , i thought i would maybe take in a hoedown .
oh , really . . . . . . well , i am a pretty good dancer if you know what i mean . . . i bet i got a few moves you ai not never seen .
and i am gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples .
i will bet you are . . . you are a naughty little thing are not ya .

huh ?
that stupid hillbilly slut .
oh , do not blow everything out of proportion .
hold on , hold on ! everybody calm down ! it is the tow truck guy .
ok lassies , i think it is time you get to gripping reality .
this is way too fucked up for words .
i am with denise , cannot we just walk to someplace , this is getting fucking stupid .
oh , i get it . . . i guess you think you are too good for the simple pleasures of halloween .
no , just a little too old .
i know you are my guests and welcome but i would please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house , thank you .

what are you doing ? . . . no , stop . . . please , please .
well hello , officer .
excuse me , i am sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon .
aw , you ai not disturbing me , but it kind of looks like rain , do not ya think ?
my name is lt . wydell , i would like to ask you a few questions .
questions ? well , heck , i will tell you anything you want to know .
i appreciate your cooperation . i am looking for a missing girl . . . . . . this girl here , denise willis . . . have you seen her ?
please , could i please come in and talk to you for a minute ? maybe you could take a better look at the picture . . . might stir up something .
i um . . . no , i do not think so . . .
please , just a minute .
thank you .
think . . . do any of these kids look familiar in any way ?
grampa . . . watch the language .
otis ! otis ! come quick , there s cops outside .
i do not know . i only saw one .
i am sure there s more than that . . . fucking pigs always travel in packs . . . . . . here , take this .
what should i do ?
i am the one who brings the devil s brandy . . .
who s your daddy !
get in . . . now !
that is true , otis . . . not that we are having a bad time , but . . .
hey .
local girl , karen murphy , been missing for a couple months , figured for a runaway .
fit the profile ?
christ , four kids could not just disappear .
no they could not , somebody had to see something .
turn up this road .
shit , do not these packrat hillbillies throw anything away ?
yeah , i hear it . . . where is it coming from ?
we gotta break it open .
tell it to my daughter .
jesus christ .
fuck , go to the car . . . call for backup . tell em officer down .
mr . willis ?
yes , sir .
well , we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town . . . closest thing we got to a lead at this point .
that is it ?
well , all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call deadwood to play nancy drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls dr . satan .
what about the body you found ?
her part in this i cannot figure . . . but i will .
i am sure there s a logical explanation .
well , let s go see if the nut that runs this place can help us .
boss , the way i see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere , bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced .
i hope you are right , but my guts are telling me different .
your spidey senses tingling .
yeah . . . . . . huh , what the hell are you talking about ?
you know , your hyper sensitive spidey senses . . . like spider man . . . . . . you know , like in the comics .
how old do you think i am ? i know who the fuck spider man is . get to your point .
you know , his senses start tingling . . . when he was approaching danger and shit .
i always favored the hulk .
hulk was dumb as shit .
aw , fuck .
plates match .
you sure this guy s supposed to ride with us ? seems kind of weird .
chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house . guy s an ex cop , thinks he can help .
sounds like a bad idea to me , probally just get in the way .
yeah , well i guess it is tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid s missing . . . besides , ai not no such thing as an ex cop .
i guess not .
yeah it is horseshit , just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with .
do not worry , we will find her .
i am gonna see if anybody s home . you and mr . willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything .
wydell .
over .
and furthermore . . . tell him , harold .
that is the wrong fork , young man . harold , tell the boy .
harold ! tell the boy again .
no buts . go to your room now .
and ?
tell him , harold .
tell him , harold .
lila , what are you doing in there ? i need to get ready for my date .
i do not know why you did not tell me about this .
it is embarrassing , okay ?
it is not so bad . so , it just keeps growing ?
yeah , natalie . it is hair . it grows .
well , do not jump down my throat . i am just trying to help .
how is that helping , natalie ? how exactly ?
look , if you are going to be like that . . . you should be appreciative that i am interested .
why , because i am a freak and you are beautiful , and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak , nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles ?

oui . perfect !
oh , hi , gabrielle .
no . do not be . i really enjoy hearing that . you are a terrific assistant .
merci . i . . . do you . . . would you like to go get a cup of coffee , perhaps ?
well , i do not know . i am actually on my way to . . .
now i am truly embarrassed . forgive me . i should not have asked such a stupid question . i know you are a very important man and . . .
no . do not be silly . it is just . . .
thank you so much for accompanying me .
not at all .
i have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man . . . but i am talking too much again , no ?
of course not .
listen , you are the best assistant i have ever had . . . gabrielle .
oh , doctor . i did not know . i am sorry to disturb you . i just came for some papers i left .
gabrielle . no , i am sorry if i startled you . i came to think . god , did i hang up on you ?
oui . perhaps i called at a bad time . i am sorry .
no . i just got distracted . i am so sorry .
is everything fine ?
oui . now you have got me talking french .
i was in my p . j . s when i remembered i left some papers i need to go over . see ? i rushed right out of the house . i must look a mess . i am so embarrassed .
coincidence , yes ? and how is our son ?
our . . . ? oh ! he seems fine . i guess we woke him . the lights and all .
i should turn them off . maybe i sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when i was a little girl .
when you were a little french girl ?
oui .
shall we close up , then ?
maybe we should just sit for a while . it is very peaceful .
it is nice , yes . i am glad i ran into you , both in our silly pajamas . it is two happy coincidences , no ?
yes . happy happy .
yet you look so sad . a great man like you should not be sad .
i am sleepy .
i should not say this , but you are pretty , gabrielle . it is unprofessional , i know .
really ? i always think myself so ugly . no , not ugly , but plain . a wallflower .
really ? no . not at all . you are a very pretty girl . you should know that . you should be confident .
thank you so much . merci . it is very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment .
it is true . i would not lie .
so soft . so smooth . i am sorry . it is just . . .
what is wrong , my darling ?
dr . bronfmangs line . yes . one moment please . lila .
yeah . okay . be home around seven . bye . what ? i am sorry . what was i supposed to do ?
i do not know , nathan . what are you supposed to do ?
you do not abandon somebody because they have a physical problem .
is not puff doing spectacularly , honey ?
hmmmph .
gabby , what is it ?
hmmph . hmmph . nathan , we have to talk , you and i .
fine .
not in front of the boy .
my little french .
stop . get away .
what is it ?
you have to choose nathan . it is like sophie s choice . only it is nathangs choice . did you ever see that movie , sophie s choice ? it is like that . only it is this .
gabby , you know i am trying to sort things out .
i love you so much , gabrielle .
but ? . . . but ? there is a but , nathan .
you were wonderful today , darling . such authority with the ape man boy . it made me so hot for you .
unnhh .
the way you are taming him , it sends chills down my girlish spine and . . . everywhere else , too .
urgh .
yeah ? what ?
call you back . you bastard ! what do you want ?
i just want to talk .
please . just one minute of your time .
why ? you have made your decision , mister stinky american ! now i hate you ! no , i do not hate you i do not even think about you !
like what ?
well , i think it would be easier if i could talk to you in person .
well , i think . . .
you think too much . i need a man who does not think so much but acts more than he thinks . . . is what i need !
what ?
you heard me ! you make me sick when you pretend to not understand what i am saying to you ! go away from here !
well ?
god , you are beautiful .
please . i look a mess .
no . you look so beautiful .
anyway . come already to the point .
i am . . . i am going to leave lila . i cannot stop thinking about you .
i have moved on .
no !
i have been seeing johannsen in chemistry .
that goddamn neanderthal ? i am the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray sun screen ! did you know that ? !
that is not how he tells it .
of course not , that swedish thief ! he is a thief of hearts ! i love you , gabrielle .
hunh .
just give me some time to let lila down easily . she is a really nice girl and i do not want to hurt her more than is necessary .
you were wonderful !
was i ? i was not a tad stiff ?
so we have got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements , my wonderful men .
lila ?
a penny for your thoughts , mon cheri .
yes , please , somebody ask him what is wrong .
i want our boy back .
oui .
that bitch . i worked so hard . we worked so hard , you and i . he would have made us famous .
we still have you and i .
i know . and that is great . but it would be great in a better way , not a better way but a different way , if i could find him and bring him back .
where do we look for little lost puff ?
i have some thoughts . i think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape .
that is horrible . apes are dirty . no ?
i am going alone . this could be dangerous .
okay , my sweet . good night .
a little resistance would be nice , damn it .
please let me go with you .
no .
my apologies , madam .
it is okay , puff .
it sha not happen again . i swear it . i am just getting my sea legs , you know .
very well .
we are going back to nature , you and i . i am going to retrain you . i am going to make you free again if i have to kill you doing it .
you what ?
i want to be the way i was before .
nice night .
you will thank me eventually , puff . well , you will not thank me , because we will not be speaking , but you will sort of thank me with a special look , the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you .
he is dead .
we bury the body . we disappear into the woods . nobody knows .
no . this is the end of the road . there s a dead human being here . for all of his faults , he was a human being , and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody .
forget him , lila . we will disappear . we will never talk about it again . we will never talk again period . i love you .
puff , what happened to you is as much my fault as nathangs . maybe more so , because i knew it was wrong and i went along with it anyway . i am taking responsibility for the murder . i want you to go back to your old life .
i will not let you do that . i shot the bastard . and i am glad .
no . go back to the woods . this is a sacrifice i need to make . in my world we have something called penance . it is another abstraction , but i had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent . it does not exist for you , and it should not . see , i could never be free again anyway , so i might as well be in jail .
then i will live for both of us , lila . i will be the most free , truest animal in the whole forest . for both of us .
that is what i am counting on .
but first i will live among them , just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind .
progress !
ouch . yeah ?
oh yes , honey . getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over . smooth as a baby s butt .
i love it , rose . i am getting to be a real girl .
you still in the market for a real boy ?
always . ow .
cause there s this guy . my brother knows him . might be right up your alley .
tell me . i could use someone up my alley .
i do not get that . is that sexual ?
shut up and tell me .
handsome , thirties , psychologist . . .
loves animals ? ouch . must love animals , rose .
loves animals . loves you .
what do you mean ?
somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine . mr . handsome , animal loving psychologist said he would love to meet you .
holy shit . your brother did not tell him about the nature of our relationship , did he ?
my brother is discreet .
will not he be able to tell ?
my brother says the guy s a thirty five year old virgin , so maybe he will not know how women usually feel . plus he is got bad eyesight , almost legally blind , which is helpful in this situation . plus he is got an extremely small penis , of which he is mortifyingly ashamed , so chances are he will be so grateful for any non judgmental attention , that he will be yours forever .
god , he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff .
so ?
i really like him , rose . he is so . . . . . . passionate about his work .
my brother says he likes you , too .
really ?
my brother says things are going really well between you and nathan .
i cannot believe how in love i am with this man .
yeah ?
he is so cute . i even like his cute little penis . it is like a little pig s penis or something . rose , we connect on every level . i have finally found someone i can feel completely safe with .
do not throw that away . i had that once with a guy . but i threw it away for a cheap thrill .
one night stand ?
no . i married a midget .
marrying a midget was a cheap thrill ?
well he was not really a midget . he was on the cusp of midgethood . that is what made it cheap . had he been an actual midget , there would have been nothing cheap about it , my dear .
i did not know you were into that sort of thing .
let me tell you , honey , midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship . they are portable . they are controllable . they are eager . and they are exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor .
i have a friend you might like to meet .
oh ?
three foot one .
be still my crotch .
rose , nathangs no midget , but he is asked me to move in with him .
yeah . my brother told me .
and i think i am going to .
no maid service ! for god s sake , cannot you read the fucking do not disturb sign on the fucking doorknob ?
lila , it is rosie .
go the fuck away , rosie .
please , honey , let me in .
rose , please go away .
how would you know where i was ?
nathan told my brother .
your brother should have his license revoked .
yeah , although i am not going to turn him in . i like hearing the dirt .
i do not know , honey . i do not know . maybe he just did not want to get involved .
oh , rosie .
done !
uh , tie them up , rosie . if you will .
i am going to miss you .
oh , rosie .
and i am going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me .
i like you so much , with or without hair . but do not spread that around . bad for business .
i will be in touch .
meditations on a banana slug was a delightful read .
thank you so much . i love slugs . all slugs , not just banana slugs .
as do i .
they are so even keel . they forge ahead with slow determination . they do not get distracted or side tracked . they do not care what they look like . they do not care that people look at them and go , ewww . a slug .
they do not seem to be especially ego driven , this is true .
you have got to respect that .
i have to say that i am not there yet .
where ?
slugdom . sluggishness . whatever you would call it . i am not there yet . i still have many human characteristics .
that is not necessarily a bad thing .
yes . i suppose not . but still . one would like to move along . to move beyond .
i am not sure we can escape our natures . believe me i have tried . i am not even so sure anymore that we should want to .
i love that you said that . it makes me feel a bit lighter . i have been rather heavy lately . thinking about my childhood . realizing how much a product i am of my upbringing . i have been seeing someone . a therapist .
you are a therapist , right ?
no no . i am a psychologist , but i do research . i am a behaviorist . i work with animals . mice at the moment .
i hope you do not perform any of those dreadful torture experiments , nathan .
heavens no . my work now is . . . right now i am teaching mice . . . well , table manners , to be candid .
how is it going ?
quite well , really . it is a lot of work . a lot of reinforcement , mostly positive . right now i have gotten two of my subjects to use napkins . tiny napkins of course .
paper or cloth ?
i hope you do not think me daft . it is important work . it is part of a larger sociological experiment . i am federally funded .
that is the larger experiment ?
it is my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice , they can be taught to humans .
going out on a limb , are not you , nathan ?
the truth is most people do not have table manners today . and when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear , civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels .
i am not sure .
courtesy , decorum , manners , are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse . rudeness , vulgarity , meanness are the norm .
we are animals after all .
it looks wonderful .
um mmm . oh nathan , this salad is delish . . .
my god ! the fork ! the fork !
i am sorry ?
tell her , harold . . . it is just that . . . it is nothing . it is just that the outside fork is the salad fork . one goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses .
oh , i am sorry . i am sorry , nathan . i never really learned those things .
boy , this is good !
i am sorry that i became so upset .
no , i am sorry . i am really backward in certain areas .
it is only that i really enjoy your company and . . .
you do ?
yes , and . . .
you really enjoy my company ?
it is just that i have some peculiarities , and . . .
i like you , too , nathan .
you do ?
yeah but i have some peculiarities also .
actually , mother and father , you look very , very old . you look terrible .
what are you doing in there ?
i will be out in a minute .
i am sorry about my parents .
you did not seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother s stupid , tasteless , cruel animal jokes .
i was simply attempting to keep the evening light . you know that i feel similarly to you about nature .
do you ?
do you ? oh do you , darling ?
oh , darling . i am so relieved . let s celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow !
it will be wonderful ! i will show you my old stomping grounds !
shaving cream ?
darling , did you bring the insect repellent lotion ?
yes , darling .
oh , and the sun block ?
of course .
what spf , sweetie ?
fifteen .
perfectomundo ! we are ready ! say , would not it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block ? think of all the time one would save .
yes , darling .
i think i will get johannsen in chemistry on that . oh ! did you bring the first aid kit ?
yes .
flares ?
absolutely .
we could call it quit bugging me , sunny . get it ? sunny . s u n n y .
that is very funny .
did you see that ?
what ?
i do not know . something .
a deer ?
no . too . . . upright . might have been a person .
come on .
you will catch cold . it is cold . what do you suppose he is , a survivalist ?
i think he is feral .
feral ? do not touch him ! he might be diseased ! he might . . . my god , rabies !
he looks perfectly fine .
i think we should go . please . before he wakes up and , i do not know , eats us , or whatever feral things do .
i do not understand you . this is fascinating and you just want to run away . i mean , here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization , totally free , and all you want to do is run back to your . . .
actually , i just had an amusing thought .
what ?
feral , huh ? totally uncontaminated ?
look at him . he does not understand english . he moves like an animal .
it is perfect !
nathan , what the hell are you talking about ?
forget mice ! actually forget guinea pigs , cats , monkeys , and chimps also . i am on to stage five the human subject .
oh no . you cannot take him from his home , nathan .
do not you see ? he is my tabula rasa , my eliza dolittle . he is my ticket to the top of the behaviorist food chain . he is going to make me famous .
i will not allow you . it is wrong . he is happy here .
is he , lila ? is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness ? never to know the love of a good woman , never to revel in the pitter patter of little feet , never to read moby dick , or marvel at a monet , or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work , smoke a pipe , and wonder about the nature of reality .
you would be taking away his freedom , nathan .
. . . what is it that makes us human , if not the knowledge that we are indeed human ? think of this poor soul s education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon . . .
all right .
what are you doing in there ?
who is it ?
who is it ?
who from work ?
it is hormonal , nathan . i cannot help it . i am sorry .
your entire body ?
i am getting electrolysis . it is working , but it takes time . so meanwhile i have to . . .
you have to shave ? like an ape ?
apes do not shave , you son of a bitch !
do not quibble . you know what i mean .
i am sorry . please do not be mad at me for this .
mad ? i am i am . . . disgusted !
i am the same person i was before you knew , damn it ! oh god !
was that okay ? i mean , was i able to . . . satisfy you ?
you are an animal .
really ? wow ! that is that is terrific to hear from someone so . . . feminine , so female .
i love being female because it , how do you say , allows me to be close to men .
so , how is it going today ?
good . making progress .
everything s fine , honey . we do not need to talk . besides i have to work late .
are you seeing somebody else , nathan ? i just have to know .
of course not .
it would just be helpful to know .
no .
because , you know , you seem so distant . and you work late every night . and we hardly ever have sex , and when we do , it is . . . i do not know . it feels different .
i am just preoccupied .
do you like my new look ?
yeah . it is nice . it is really good .
i am trying , you know . i am trying to be what you want . i want to be what you want , nathan . all i want is to be what you want .
shh . it is okay . it is okay , lila . you are what i want . you know that . you are exactly what i want .
really ?
sure . of course .
because i am really trying , you know . rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis .
that is great .
that is great . it is a great color for you .
oh ! i did not see you there , sneaky boy ! you are like a boy sneaking in . . .
. . . the back door of a movie theater . yes , indeed .
you remember that from my book ? i am touched ! that is wrong ?
nothing . hard day . gonna have a drink .
how is work ?
cruddy , okay ? are you satisfied ?
no . i do not want your work to be cruddy .
my assistant quit today . okay ? he was highly valuable to the project .
oh , baby . i am sorry . cannot you hire somebody else ?
hey ! i could come work for you ! i know i have not been all that supportive of this project , but i have come around .
have you ?
oh yes , baby ! i think that this is a wonderful project you are doing , taking this poor unfortunate , uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being ! what a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are !
really ?
yes ! and i want to help . you will not have to pay me , and i was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway .
how come ?
who needs it ? i have you and i have being a woman and i have thinking about womanly things ! i love being a woman because . . .
such as what womanly things ?
such as my man and how to please him ! such as making wonderful dinners for my man ! such as looking pretty for my man ! and i am writing an article on quilting for the ladies home journal !
i had sold my fucking soul .
bravo to you , puff !
i think he is ready .
you just have to control it . we are not apes .
puff , i am proud of you ! you did remarkably well under difficult circumstances .
i am going to go down and check on puff . see how he is holding up .
should i come with ?
nah . you just relax . how is the book ?
you were gone a long time .
yeah . puff and i got into a big , philosophical discussion . he is really quite well read , considering he is only been literate for a month now . he is going to make us famous , lila .
so he is doing okay ?
seemed fine . quiet evening enjoying his new digs .
that is funny because , you know , i just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside . he called here when he ran out of his mad money after spending an entire evening drinking , watching strippers , and fucking a whore ! oh , and what did you do tonight , honey ?
shit .
and what did you do tonight , honey ?
i have fallen in love with somebody else , lila .
and what did you do tonight , honey ?
i fucked her ! okay ? i fucked her . i am sorry . but that is what the hell i did .
do you know what i gave up to be with you ?
yes .
i gave up my soul , my beliefs . i gave up my body hair !
yeah , well , i am sorry . the human heart is a strange thing .
how the hell would you know anything about the human heart ?
shut up ! yeah , this is lila , cunt . and do not let the hirsutism fool you . i know more about being a woman , and more about the black hearts of men than you , in your pretty little powdered , bullshit fantasy world , can ever imagine . i know the darkness and cruelty of nature , sweetie pie .
lila , you do not intend to hurt us , do you ?
aha ! finally . i have covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern ohio .
look at you two . you both disgust me .
oook . oook .
shut up ! i gave you . . . life . i created you in my image , puff . i took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners . and this is how you repay me ? by heading back to the ooze first chance you get ? i should leave you here with lila the ape woman . it would serve you right , you ungrateful piece of crap . but i am not going to . you are too valuable to me . totally selfish of me . you serve my purpose . but if you had any smarts you would realize that i serve your purpose as well . life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit .
ooka .
good eve n ing lay dees and gent elmen .
oh boy !
now , puff , we are leaving on the electronic collar . i do not think we will need to shock you , but just in case .
this is great , puff . you are doing fine .
i do not think this aversion therapy is really necessary , doctor . i understand the problem .
humor me , puff . it is essential that i am able to trust you to function independently in the world .
i bow to your expertise in these matters .
excellent work , puff . extra desert tonight .
yahoo !
did i ? i tried so hard ! i really concentrated ! oh , i am so happy !
and because you did so well , we have a little surprise for you .
extra dessert ?
free to come and go as you please . there s some mad money in the night table drawer .
it is wonderful ! do you think i am ready ? do you really ?
i trust that you will make good , mature decisions . i trust that you will do the proper thing .
oh , i will ! your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me . i do not want to disappoint you .
good . remember , when in doubt do not ever do what you really want to do .
puff , why do not you say a few words to the assemblage .
thanks to you , nate .
and of course to you , my sweet , for your . . . moral support .
interesting .
ugnh .
oh please , is that as articulate as you can be after all the time i spent teaching you ? we have discussed wittgenstein , for christ s sake . not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject .
unn .
puff , put the gun down .
ounpoo . ungh .
let s be reasonable human beings here . we are all reasonable human beings , are not we ?
unka unka unka unka unka .
look , why do not you and lila stay here and have your natural life . i will just go on my way . you will never see me again .
you did create me in your image , nathan . before you i was a simple , happy , complete being , in harmony with the world around me . after you i became duplicitous , cynical , angry , anal , totally out of touch with my surroundings . in a word , nathan , i became you . lila has reintroduced me to myself . and , incidentally , what i am about to do , kill you , is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the earth . before when i killed , it was for food or in self defense . now i will kill for revenge . revenge is an abstract concept , nathan . and i learned abstract thinking from you .
so anyway , that is the nightmare i have been having lately .
do you suppose it has anything to do with lila s unusually hairy body ?
no , why ?
well , it seems that since lila broached the subject of children , you have been on edge and i know you have an issue with the , uh , body hair .
oh , i see . yes , that is something to think about . that is very good . that is what you get the big bucks , right ? ha ha .
i just think it might be important to explore your feelings for lila .
i love lila . i mean , she is a wonderful person . and . . . she loves me ! that is no small potatoes . i mean she really loves me . she is sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me . and she is a good person . a truly good person . how rare is that in this world , eh ? and how could i stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection , if it can even be called that . i mean , god knows i am not perfect ! what about my eyesight ? it is lousy , that is what ! lila s not going to leave me because of my eyesight . what about my penis ?
wait !
yes ?
mother ?
it is a pleasure to meet you , mother . but i am an ape like dad was . . . and i have to go back into the woods now . . . forever .
yes , i suppose so . i suppose i knew that was going to be what you would say . it is good to see you again though .
yes .
i am in the book , if you ever want to drop me a line or something .
boys just passing through ?
yep .
pittsburgh ?
mm hmm .
coming in or going out ?
going in . we got a sales convention . gotta be there tomorrow .
thanks . sure is a hot day for driving . late afternoon is better . you guys have plenty of time . make pittsburgh in two , maybe three hours .
about sixty , seventy bucks .
give me some bourbon . j . t . s . brown .
you want a chaser ?
hey , another one for me and another one for the lady .
check !
give me a bottle of beer .
huh ?
you sure you going to be comfortable enough there , miss . . . ah . . . ?
packard . sarah packard .
it always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind . are you sure you do not want anything ?
no , i am fine .
you , uh , you ever been to louisville during derby week , miss , ah , packard ?
i have never been to louisville .
i am ready .
what makes you know so much ? how do you know what eddie was thinking ?
does not your lighter work , mr . gordon ?
it is all right , eddie . i am sure mr . gordon meant no offense . it was a figure of speech .
that is right , miss packard .
and a fact is a fact .
oh , wait a minute , miss packard .
i want to talk to you .
do we need words ?
yeah , i think we do . we could try to cut each other up . but that would be bad for everybody . bad for me , bad for you . and worst of all , be bad for eddie .
you know that is good for him ?
to win .
for whom and for what ?
for what makes the world go round . for money , and for glory .
you did not answer my first question . for whom ?
all right . today for me , tomorrow for himself .
no , there s no tomorrow . not with you . you own all the tomorrows because you buy them today , and you buy cheap .
you bastard .
i will make it up to you .
how ?
are you ready for another ?
in a little while . that is what you want , is not it ?
put it on the bed . that is the way it is done , is not it ?
that is the way it is done .
and the way you are looking at me , is that the way you look at a man you have just beaten ? as if you would just taken his money , and now all you want is . . . his pride ?
all i want s the money .
could be .
we will be there .
oh , we will start small . . . a hundred dollars a game .
i am sure mr . felson knows what he is doing . certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out .
how much ?
oh , about five hundred .
do you really think you can beat him ?
of course he thinks he can beat me , bert . he would not be playing me if he did not . right , felson ?
have you noticed , bert ? this fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you . it seems as though you might have modeled for the artist .
that seems a shame . the night is young .
will you take a check , bert ?
cash .
how much do i owe you ?
hey , mister .
the name s gordon . bert gordon .
stay with this kid . he is a loser .
okay ?
make it twenty .
cut .
bourbon . j . t . s . brown .
i am buying .
thought you only drank milk .
only when i work .
yeah ? why ?
i like it . it is good for you . besides , you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing . that is something you do not need an excuse for losing . how did you make out in the poker game ?
i lost twenty bucks .
poker s not your game .
what is ?
pool .
you being cute ?
i do not think there s a pool player alive shoots better pool than i saw you shoot the other night at ames . you got talent .
so i got talent . so what beat me ?
character .
yeah . sure , sure .
you are damned right i am sure . everybody s got talent . i got talent . you think you can play big money straight pool , or poker , for forty straight hours on nothing but talent ? you think they call minnesota fats the best in the country just cause he is got talent ? nah . minnesota fats s got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body .
i got drunk .
he drank as much whisky as you did .
maybe he knows how to drink .
you bet he knows how . you think that is a talent too , huh ? knowing how to drink whisky ? you think minnesota fats was born knowing how to drink ?
okay , okay . . . what do i do now , lie down on the floor and , uh , bow from the ankles ? what do i do , go home ?
that is your problem .
maybe by that time you will die of old age . how much do you think you will , uh , need ?
a thousand .
no , three thousand at least . he will start you off at five hundred a game he will beat the pants off you . that is the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is . he will beat you flat four or five games maybe more , depending on how , uh . . . steady your nerves are . but he might he just might be a little scared of you , and that could change things . but i would not count on it .
how do you know ? huh ? when nobody knows that much ?
see that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in ? well , that is mine . i like that car . but i get a new one every year because i make it my business to know what guys like you and minnesota fats are gonna do . i made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over .
eddie , is it all right if i get personal ?
whaddya been so far ?
eddie , you are a born loser .
that is that supposed to mean ?
first time in ten years i ever saw minnesota fats hooked , really hooked . but you let him off .
i told you . i got drunk .
sure , you got drunk . that is the best excuse in the world for losing . no trouble losing when you got a good excuse . and winning ! that can be heavy on your back too . like a monkey . you drop that load too when you got an excuse . all you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself . it is one of the best indoor sports feeling sorry for yourself a sport enjoyed by all , especially the born losers .
thanks for the drink .
wait a minute . maybe i can help you .
to do what ?
get the three thousand . play minnesota fats again .
why ?
ten reasons . maybe fifteen . and also there s something in it for me .
oh yeah , i figured that . how much ?
seventy five per cent .
for who ?
for me .
that is a that is a pretty big slice . who do you think you are , general motors ?
how much you think you are worth these days ? i am putting up the money , i am putting up the time . for that i get seventy five per cent return on my money if you win .
you think i can lose ?
i never saw you do anything else .
you saw me beat minnesota fats for eighteen thousand dollars .
look , you wanna hustle pool , do not you ? this game is not like football . nobody pays you for yardage . when you hustle you keep score real simple . the end of the game you count up your money . that is how you find out who s best . that is the only way .
why back me then ? why not back yourself ? go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich . you know all the angles .
i am already rich . but i like action . that is one thing i think you are good for is action . besides , like i say . . . you got talent .
yeah , you already told me that . you cut that slice down to bite size and maybe we can talk .
no , we do not talk . i do not make bad bets . seventy five , twenty five . that is it .
hey , wait . what are you gonna do about the money ?
there are places . i will scuffle around .
word s out on you , eddie . you walk in the wrong kind of place and they will eat you alive .
now , when did you adopt me ?
hello , eddie .
hi . how is business ?
ahh , slow . . . why the open hand bridge ? something wrong with your hand ?
yeah . had a little accident . a place called arthur s .
oh . you seem to do all right that way .
i would say my game is about twenty per cent off . maybe more .
what happened ? somebody step on your hands ?
yeah . big creep . broke my thumbs .
man named turk baker ?
you know everybody , do not you ?
everybody who can hurt me , everybody who can help me . it pays .
maybe you oughta give me lessons .
sign up .
where do i sign ?
the first match i got in mind for you is in louisville , kentucky .
you name the place , boss . i will be there .
what happened to you anyway ?
like i told ya . my thumbs .
no , i do not mean the thumbs . you already told me about the thumbs .
i been thinking .
thinking about what ?
maybe i am not such a high class piece of property right now . and a twenty five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothing .
sarah packard . . . bert gordon .
james findley is a very rich man . grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company .
what ? and he he hustles pool ?
he is a gentleman . gentleman gambler . he gets his kicks playing with hustlers . he is got an old southern mansion with a pool table in the basement , drinks eight year old bourbon , smokes cork tipped cigarettes .
how good is he ?
you must have a lot of confidence in me .
i do not . but i got confidence in findley .
that is that supposed to mean ?
here , i got it .
fats knew the game was in the clutch , knew he had to do something to stop ya . he played it smart .
i played that game , bert . in my head i played it a thousand times .
fine .
good . i would hate to think i was putting my money on a cripple .
you know , that is real sweet music in there . you can almost smell the action and the money . you know , i can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes .

i can beat him .
i will beat him the next game .
how are the hands ?
they are fine .
hey , bert . wait a minute !
i can beat him , bert . now he suckered me cause he knows how to hustle . i did not think he did . but i can outplay him . i can beat him .
i do not believe you , eddie . i think you are still a loser .
please do not get off me now .
i know when to quit . you do not . win or lose , you do not know when to quit .
i wanna walk .

i got time , bert .

if we want it , it is .
wow . there s the town . and there s the air base . this is a great hill .
it is got a name . copper ridge . there used to be a copper mine near here .
a meteorite , dad , look !
it is that time of year again . we should get a pretty good show out here .
why , dad ?
there are more this year than last .
this should be the heaviest shower of the year .
. . . and rigel .
which one s that ? the dull , red one .
well , son ? should we call it a night ? i for one have had a long day .
jim that is wrong ? !
it was big and it glowed and it went down over there behind the hill .
what did it look like ?
are you sure you saw that ? in the rain it may have u looked u like it changed shape
i do not know , dad . but it was big .
are you all right , dad ?
i lost it . it is kind of muddy out there .
i had an awful dream .
what , jim , what ?
. . . and then everything blew up . and then i woke up .
that is a doozy of a dream , son .
it was so real , dad .
i know , ellen . we will settle down soon .
i was so scared .
i have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping . this house needs just u everything u . i will probably be gone all day . jimmy , hurry up and eat or you will be late .
i will take you to school .
it is probably the solenoid . take it back to gleasongs , they said they would fix it if we found anything wrong .
what happened to you ? who was that ?
that is ed . ed works with the bell telephone switching division .
where is your car ?
i left it at work .
i am home now .
you know , it really is beautiful up there . let me show you . we will take a walk after dinner .
that is wrong , ellen ?
better get some sleep , son , or you will be pretty tired at school tomorrow .
we will be by to pick him up in ten minutes .
what do you mean gone ? what the hell kind of a nurse are you , anyway ?
what did he talk to you about ?
he was upset with moving , i believe .
is that all he said ?
hello , this is ms . magnuson speaking .
i understand , miss , that you have my son in your office .
yes , i do , mr . gardner .
may i ask why ?
we were having a little talk .
about what ?
children often have trouble adjusting to a new school .
i do not know what he is told you what u has u he told you ? would you like to tell u me u ?
mr . gardner , i
you people have a lot of nerve , taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn . i am of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle . . . what sort of training do you have anyway ?
mr . gardner , i do not think this is the place to discuss this matter .
i am not particularly interested , u ms . u magnuson , in what you think is correct . my wife and i are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want jimmy with us . keep him in your office until we arrive .
this is a new town for you . do you like it here ?
no .
why not ? moving is hard for anybody . was it hard for you to leave all your friends ?
i do not have many friends . dad s all the time moving .
that is quite a story . you know that , do not you ?
yes .
how did it get mrs . mckeltch ?
she said the frog came from around the copper ridge . she must have been behind the hill .
what would you think if somebody told you a story like this ?
i would believe him .
why ?
do you know how to follow a map ?
yes . i can even read star maps .
jimmy , calm down ! what happened ? tell me what happened !
i got trapped in mrs . mckeltch s van and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them behind my house . i saw them .
where , jimmy ?
behind my house , up on the ridge .
this is where it was the tunnel opening .
i do not see anything .
i swear it was here .
but it is not , jimmy .
no .
they will get us .
does it look to you like anything landed here ?
stay here . i am going to make a phone call .
who are you calling ?
did you call the state police ?
no one comes here after dark .
damn .
what is it ?
but you saw the men go under the sand . . .
do not go in .
i am not . they must be tunneling under the whole town .
we cannot do this alone . we have got to get help .
there was a man named colonel wilson , from the air force base . he was talking in our class . he said we could visit him any time we wanted . i will bet he could do something .
you are looking for life ?
well , come on , you two . time to go to bed .
mom this is the best show all year .
what do you think he saw ? could it have been something from the air base ?
george , where have you been ?
your father asked you a question .
hi . sorry i am late .
mom . i gotta talk to you .
what ?
when ?
this afternoon . it is wonderful up there you still have not seen the best part .
i have school .
it is all this moving from place to place . we are never settled . i am having nightmares myself .
what kind , mom ?
that is the story on jimmy gardner ?
gardner ? oh , um he is a new student . just moved here . why ?
his teacher brought him in to see me . said he would been acting up in class . creating a disturbance . i could not get a thing out of him .
oh ?
that is his family background ?
ms . magnuson , is jimmy gardner with you ?
why , yes .
jimmy s father is on the phone . i wonder if you would take the call .
penicillin . at least it will help keep his fever down .
it is really nice of you to help us .
i wish i could do more but we are moving out .
we are going with you . i mean , we are going too .
this could be our last night on earth . i do not want to die a virgin .
what do you want ?
you have to leave the white house .
this is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion .
in case you have not noticed , we are in a little bit of a crisis here .
i have worked with embedded loading . they are communicating with a hidden signal . they are going to attack . . .
you are being paranoid .
what ?
connie , do not hang up .
david ? how would you get this number ?
and when is the countdown supposed to expire ?
what do you want me to do ?
i want you to leave with us . right now .
i cannot leave . we have to tell this to the president .
you cannot be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons ?
just my luck , no ice .
i take it you have heard .
you still believe in him .
he is a good man .
better be . you left me for him .
thirty seconds ? is not that cutting it a little too close ?
with you ? i do not understand why you cannot just show someone how to plant the virus , somebody trained for this kind of mission ?
are you all right ?
did it work ?
david thought i was having an affair , which i was not .
moishe martinsburg , mr . president .
he still gets air sick , huh ? in all of this i did not get the chance to thank you two .
spunky . he told you about that ?
all he could think about was getting to you . there s still love there i think .
love was never our problem .
can we expect the same kid of panic here as in russia ?
i do not know how you put up with him .
he used to run the nasa . he knows where all the bones are buried . comes in handy .
you saved a lot of lives .
we are losing them .
what the hell is the point of having a beeper if you do not turn it on ?
it was turned on . i was ignoring you . that is the big emergency ?
what the hell is this ?
did you try to switch to transponder channels ?
let s retrofit the dish to another satellite .
there s good news and bad news .
that is the bad news ?
you are in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch .
and the good news is you will not charge me .
no . the good news is i found the problem and it is not our equipment . there s some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed .
yes , because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it . when i find the exact binary sequence and i apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer i built you last christmas , we should be able to block out the overlay completely . . .
i have got a lock on the signal pattern . we can filter it out .
huh ? oh , good , good .
strange thing is , if my calculations are right it will be gone in approximately seven hours anyway . the signal reduces itself every time it recycles . eventually it will disappear . are you listening ?
can you believe this ?
what are you talking about ?
tell her to get the kids and leave town .
what happened ?
okay , why did i just send my family to atlanta ?
remember i told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction .
not really . . .
that signal . it is a countdown .
a countdown to what ?
then what ?
what are you waiting ? my social security will expire , you will still be sitting there .
i am thinking .
you have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose ?
david , i have been meaning to talk with you . it is nice you have been spending so much time with me , but . . .
dad , do not start .
i am only saying , it is been what ? four years , you still have not signed your divorce papers .
three years .
pops !
the television said they have started with the looting already . vultures .
you still got the olds ?
you want to borrow the car ? you do not have a license .
it is the white house , for crying out loud . you cannot just drive up and ring the bell .
cannot this thing go any faster ?
you think they do not know what you know ? believe me , they know . she works for the president . they know everything .
they do not know this .
and you are going to educate them ? tell me something , you are so smart how come you spent eight years at m . i . t . to become a cable repairman ?
dad . . .
what the hell is that ?
this , pops , is every phone book in america .
you think an important person like constance is going to be listed ?
not listed , huh ?
i just have not found it yet . i tried c . halbrook , connie halbrook , spunky halbrook . . .
spunky ?
college nickname .
you try martin ?
perfect , she is using it .
it is perfect the line is busy ?
yes . i can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the white house .
sure he will listen . why would not he ?
because last time i saw him i punched him in the face .
you punched the president in the face ?
it is air force one for crying out loud . still he gets sick ?
dad , please . . .
david , david ! what the hell are you doing ! ?
i am making a mess .
this i can see .
we have gotta burn the rain forest , pops . dump toxic waste , pollute the air , rip up the ozone . maybe if we screw this planet up enough they will not want it anymore .
pops , you are a genius !
what would i say ?
thanks , pops .
i will see how they are doing with the radio transmitter .
oh shit , we are late .
i have a confession to make . i am not real big on flying .
what the hell are you doing ?
must be thousands of them . what are they doing ?
get us out of here !
what are you doing ?
nice meeting you .
we are loose !
does not matter . game s over .
with your permission , mr . president , i would like to remain my your side .
i had a feeling you would .
sir , what happens if they do become hostile ?
general grey , co ordinate with atlantic command . tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can .
but mr . president . . .
is my wife in the air ?
any news on my wife ?
where are they ?
atlanta , chicago and philadelphia , destroyed ?
and our forces ?
we are down to approximately fifteen percent , sir . if you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on , we are looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours .
organize every plane you can find and get some goddamned pilots to fly them .
how are we doing ?
we have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world . most of europe , the middle east and asia are battle ready .
and our troops here ?
we have been collecting planes from all over but . . .
but what , general ?
pilots , sir . we do not have enough people to get them in the air .
mr . president , just what do you think you are doing ?
grey , you read me ?
where is it headed ?
do not engage until we have confirmed the package has been delivered .
get on the horn with atlantic command . let s upgrade the situation to defcon .
organize a military escort to crystal mountain .
more ships keep arriving , fifteen in total so far .
this is crazy . we are loosing our first strike capabilities !
that is impossible . . .
my god , the vice president and the joint chiefs . . .
you were the head of the national intelligence agency ! you knew all about this . when were you planning on informing the rest of us ! ?
it had been deemed classified .
this is ridiculous .
with their shields down it might be possible .
a meteor ?
no sir . definitely not .
how do you know ?
well , er . . . it is slowing down .
it is doing what ?
he is trying to impress you .
you cannot go . call them back .
baby , you know how it is . i have to report to el toro right away .
you said you were on leave for the fourth .
wait . i have to tell you something .

dylan , come here . i want you to meet the first lady .
i thought you did not recognize me .
i do not believe it . they make you learn how to fly everything from an apache to a harrier and still they turn you down ? what else do they want you to learn ?
jasmine has this thing for dolphins . i had them make it . . .
that is an affirmative . i have victory dance . mmmmmmm .
do not get premature on me , jimmy . we do not light up til the fat lady sings .
i should not have left her .

i did not even see them fire !
jimmy , kick it ! they are gaining .
we are already over mach !
stevie . . . i cannot . . .

it is all fuzzy .
i do not need it .
he is got that sega saturn cd , bit , right ?
yeah . what would you think if we went there to live for a while ?
but i gave you some this morning .
just what the hell do you think you are doing ?
i am bringing home the bacon . earning my keep . and doing a fine job if i do say so myself .
it is the wrong field , you idiot ! lucas farm is on the other side of town .
you sure ?
they let you out ?
we are leaving , do not try and stop us .
troy s still my son no matter how you feel about me .
i could not find anything . everyone is packing up , they are leaving . word is a space ship is heading this way .
we should leave too .
how he doing ?
i am not leaving .
we must maintain a working government in a time of crisis . . .
i want the vice president , secretary of defense , the whole cabinet and the joint chiefs taken to a secured location . i am staying here . i am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives .
but , mr . president . . .
what the hell s going on ?
i spoke with the joint chief when they arrived at norad . they agree , we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike . hit em with everything we have got .
above american soil ?
why the hell was not i told about this place ?
mr . president ?
call them back .
the other bombers might have more luck . we should not just give up . . .
mr . president , a real pleasure . they do not let us out much , you know .
yes .
see , we cannot duplicate their type of power so we have never been able to experiment . but since these guys started showing up , all the gizmos inside turned on . the last twenty four hours have been really exciting !
what can you tell us about the enemy we are facing ?
can they be killed ?
why did you people come here ?
air . . . water . . . your sun .
where do your people come from ? where is your home ?
here . . . now .
and before here ?
many worlds . . .
can we negotiate a truce ? is there room for co existance ? can there be peace between us ?
peace ? no peace .
what do you want us to do ?
oh , sallah ! what a relief !
marcus brody , sir . and where is indy ?
oh , he is in austria . a slight detour .
yes , but do not panic . everything s under control . have you . . . have you arranged our supplies ?
oh , yes , of course . but where are we going ?
oh , what ? . . . your servant , sir .
my reputation precedes me .
yes .
yes .
egyptian mail . morning edition . run !
may we go home now , please ?
marcus ! i did it !
you know how long i have been looking for that ? !
all your life .
all my life !
your treat .
what has the old fool got himself into now ?
dad ?
venice , italy !
it is dad s grail diary . every clue he ever followed . every discovery he made . a complete record of his search for the holy grail . this is his whole life . why would he have sent this to me ?
i do not know . but someone must want it pretty badly .
do you believe the grail actually exists ?
but if you want facts , indy , i have none to give you . at my age , i am prepared to take a few things on faith .
call donovan , marcus . tell him i will take that ticket to venice now .
ah , venice . . .
yes . uh , how will we recognize this doctor schneider when we see him ?
that does not look much like a library .
marcus i have seen this window before .
look , indy . the roman numerals !
dad was onto something here !
how is the head ?
the present city of iskenderun is built on its ruins . marcus you remember what the grail tablet said . across the desert and through the mountain to the canyon of the crescent moon . but where exactly ?
now , he knew there was a city with an oasis due east . here . he knew the course turned south through the desert to a river , and the river led into the mountains . here . straight to the canyon . he knew everything except where to begin , the name of the city .
alexandretta . now we know .
yes . now we know .
what about you ?
indy . . . indy , you must hurry ! ! come quickly !
marcus !
henry ! what are you doing here ? !
henry , the pen
what ?
look what you did !
the word of god . . .
no , henry . try not to talk .
indy ! henry ! follow met i know the way ! haaa !
tell me , that is going to happen when we get to venice ?
do not worry . doctor schneider will be there to meet you .
schneider ?
i maintain an apartment in venice , at your disposal .
care to wet your whistle , marcus ?
well , marcus , we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind .
are you expected ?
do not take that tone with me , my good man . now buttle off and tell baron brunwald that lord clarence macdonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries .
tapestries ?
dear me , the man is dense . this is a castle , is not it ? there are tapestries ?
this is a castle . and we have many tapestries . but if you are a scottish lord , then i am mickey mouse .
my name is donovan . walter donovan .
i know who you are mr . donovan . your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous . some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive .
well , it is sandstone . christian symbol . early latin text . mid twelfth century , i should think .
that was our assessment as well .
where did this come from ?
where the cup that holds the blood of jesus christ resides forever .
the arthur legend . i have heard this bedtime story before .
eternal life , doctor jones ! the gift of youth to whoever drinks from the grail . oh , now that is a bedtime story i would like to wake up to !
an old mangs dream .
hard to resist , is not it ? the holy grail s final resting place described in detail !
what good is it ? this grail tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons . pretty vague . where do you start looking ? maybe if the tablet were intact , you would have something to go on . but the entire top portion is missing .
let me tell you another bedtime story , doctor jones . after the grail was entrusted to joseph of arimathaea , it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three knights of the first crusade . three brothers , to be exact .
i have heard this one as well . two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the grail and began the long journey back to france . but only one of them made it . and before dying of extreme old age , he supposedly imparted his tale to a to a franciscan friar , i think .
this is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the knight s story . . . it does not reveal on location of the grail , i am afraid . . . but the knight promised that two markers that had been left behind would . this tablet is one of those markers . it proves the knight s story is true . but as you pointed out it is incomplete . now , the second marker is entombed with the knight s dead brother . our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of venice , italy . as you can now see , doctor jones , we are about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago . we are only one step away .
that is usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet .
you could be more right than you know .
yes ?
we have hit a snag . our project leader has vanished . along with all his research . uh , we received a cable from his colleague , doctor schneider , who has no idea of his whereabouts or that is become of him . i want you to pick up the trail where he left off . find the man and you will find the grail .
you have got the wrong jones , mister donovan . why do not you try my father ?
donovan !
impossible ? what do you say , jones ? ready to go down in history ?
as what ? a nazi stooge like you ?
nazis ? ! is that the limit of your vision ? ! the nazis want to write themselves into the grail legend and take on the world . well , they are welcome . but i want the grail itself . the cup that gives everlasting life . hitler can have the world , but he cannot take it with him . i am going to be drinking my own health when he is gone the way of the dodo . the grail is mine , and you are going to get it for me .
shooting me will not get you anywhere .
i am through !
doctor jones ?
yes ?
and my mother s ears . but the rest belongs to you .
the last time i saw your father we were in the library . he was very close to tracking down the knight s tomb . i have never seen him so excited . he was as giddy as a schoolboy .
fraulein will you permit me ?
i usually do not .
i usually do not either .
it would make me very happy .
but i am already sad by tomorrow it will have faded .
my dad sent me this diary for a reason . until we find out why , i suggest we keep it to ourselves .
bingo .
you do not disappoint , doctor jones . you are a great deal like your father .
except he is lost , and i am not .
pagan symbols . fourth or fifth century .
right . six hundred years before the crusades .
the ark of the covenant .
are you sure ?
it must be one of these . . .
that is that ?
would not it be wonderful if he were here now to see this ?
do not wander off .
i said go around !
you said go between them !
my room !
mine , too .
this .
the grail diary .
uh huh .
at least i let you tag along .
oh , yes . give them a flower and they will follow you anywhere .
knock it off . you are not mad .
no ?
no . you like the way i do things .
what do you know about this place ?
what are you going to do ?
this one . i think he is in here .
this book contained a map a map with no names precise directions from the unknown city to the secret canyon of the crescent moon .
how did you get here ?
you came back for the book ? why ?
is that what you think of me ? i believe in the grail , not the swastika .
yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the grail stands for who gives a damn what you think ?
all i have to do is squeeze .
i never expected to see you again .
elsa ! elsa , do not move !
it is ours , indy . yours and mine .
elsa . elsa do not . elsa . elsa . give me your other hand , honey . i cannot hold you .
dad !
out !
it is important !
then wait count to twenty .
no , dad . you listen to me
it is you junior !
do not call me that , please .
but what are you doing here ?
oh , it breaks the heart .
and the head . you hit me , dad !
i will never forgive myself
do not worry i am fine .
no ! dad , get your stuff . we have got to get out of here .
well , i am sorry about your head , though . but i thought you were one of them .
dad , they come in through the doors .
humpf so i was wrong this time . but by god , i was not wrong when i mailed you my diary . you obviously got it .
i got it and i used it . we found the entrance to the catacombs .
through the library ?
right .
found it .
he was actually there ? you saw him ?
well , what was left of him .
and his shield . . . the inscription on sir richard s shield . . . ?
alexandretta . it is a great moment in henry s life . he turns aside , lost to himself for a moment , then turns to indy with joy .
. . . you did it .
no , dad . you did . forty years .
if only i could have been with you .
there were rats , dad .
rats ?
yeah , big ones . what do the nazis want with you dad ?
they want my diary .
you did not , did you ? you did not bring it , did you ?
well , uh . . .
you did ! !
look , can we discuss this later ?
i should have mailed it to the marx brothers .
will you take it easy !
take it easy ? ! why do you think i sent it home in the first place ? so it would not fall into their hands ! !
i came here to save you .
no ! do not shoot !
she ransacked her own room and i fell for it . how did you know she was a nazi ?
umh ?
how did you she was a nazi ?
ooooh . . . i like the austrian way better .
so did i .
let s try and get these ropes loose . we have got to get to marcus before the nazis do !
you said he had two days start . that he would blend in . disappear !
what am i looking for ?
my lucky charm .
feels like a cigarette lighter .
i ought to tell you something .
do not get sentimental now dad save it til we get out of here .
the floor s on fire ! see ? !
what ? ? ?
and the chair .
dad !
what ?
dad !
what ?
what ?
head for the fireplace !
this is intolerable !
dad !
come on , dad . come on !
stop !
what ?
you are going the wrong way ! we have to get to berlin !
brody s this way .
my diary s in berlin .
you do not need the diary , dad . marcus has the map .
there is more in the diary than just the map .
all right dad tell me .
well , he who finds the grail must face the final challenge .
what final challenge ?
three devices of such lethal cunning .
booby traps ?
oh , yes . but i found the clues that will safely take us through , in the chronicles of st . anselm .
but what are they ? cannot you remember ?
i wrote them down in my diary so that i would not have to remember .
half the german army s on our tail and you want me to go to berlin ? into the liongs den ?
yes ! the only thing that matters is the grail .
what about marcus ?
marcus would agree with me .
that is for blasphemy . the quest for the grail is not archaeology . it is a race against evil . if it is captured by the nazis , the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth . do you understand me ?
this is an obsession dad . i never understood it . never . neither did mom .
what did you get ?
i do not know . the first available flight out of germany .
when we are airborne , with germany behind us , then i will share that sentiment .
you know , sharing your adventures is an interesting experience .
that is not all we shared . it is disgraceful . you are old enough to be her fa . . . er , her grandfather !
well , i am as human as the next man .
i was the next man .
do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink ? i had a milk shake .
hmmm . . . what did we talk about ?
we did not talk . we never talked .
and do i detect a rebuke ?
a regret . it was just the two of us , dad . it was a lonely way to grow up . for you , too . if you had been an ordinary , average father like the other guys dads , you would have understood that .
actually , i was a wonderful father .
did i ever tell you to eat up ? go to bed ? wash your ears ? do your homework ? no . i respected your privacy and i taught you self reliance .
what you taught me was that i was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country . and i learned it so well that we have hardly spoken for twenty years .
you left just when you were becoming interesting .
dad , how can you ?
well . . . i cannot think of anything .
then what are you complaining about ? look , we have work to do . when we get to alexandretta we will face three challenges . first , the breath of god . only the penitent man will pass . second , the word of god , only in the footsteps of god will he proceed . third , the path of god , only in the leap from the liongs head will he prove his worth .
what does that mean ?
i did not know you could fly a plane .
dad eleven o clock ! !
dad , are we hit ? !
nice landing .
those people are trying to kill us !
i know , dad !
it is a new experience for me .
this is intolerable !
what do you think you are doing ? ! get down !
now , who are all these people ?
dad ?
you call this archaeology ?
dad ? !
only the penitent man will pass . only the penitent man will pass .
the penitent man will pass . the penitent . . . the penitent . the penitent man . . .
the penitent man is humble before god .
penitent . penitent . . .
but in the latin alphabet , jehovah begins with an i .
junior , give me your other hand ! i cannot hold on ! !
elsa never really believed in the grail . she thought she would found a prize .
what did you find , dad ?
what did you find , junior ?
i like indiana .
ready ?
uh huh .
after you , junior .
i knew you would come , but my strength has left me .
who are you ?
the last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the grail and to guard it .
that was seven hundred years ago .
you are strangely dressed . . . for a knight .
i am not exactly . . . a knight . what do you mean ?
get that camel out of the way !
what happened to marcus , sallah ?
that car belonged to my brother in law .
i am going after those horses .
i will take the camels .
i do not need camels .
but , indy
sallah , i said no camels ! that is five camels . cannot you count ?
compensation for my brother in law s car . indy , your father and brody
where is my father ?
why are you trying to kill us ?
because you are looking for the holy grail .
my father was looking for the holy grail . did you kill him too ?
no .
where is he ? talk or you are dead . damn it , tell me ! tell me !
if you do not let go , doctor jones , we will both die .
then we will die .
this is your last chance .
all right ! where is my father
if you let me go , i will tell you where he is .
who are you ?
my name is kazim .
and why were you trying to kill me ?
ask yourself , why do you seek the cup of christ ? is it for his glory , or for yours ?
i did not come for the cup of christ . i came to find my father .
captain blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the natives .
just a routine inspection tour .
dr . jones , you know very well that the thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century .
well , mr . prime minister , my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in pankot .
i am sure that will please the maharajah , captain .
interested in local curios ?
charming .
it is like the voodoo dolls of west africa . the kryta represents your enemy and gives you complete power over him .
thank god all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing .
you think so ?
you are hanging on better here than you did in america .
the prime minister does not seem that naive .
i am sure it is nothing . just rumors . what was it they claimed was stolen ?
rather bizarre menu , would not you say ?
i have spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels i should not have let somebody like willie go in there with me .
miss scott panicked ?
then she must have run out of the room and you found her .
i believe we are being called to dinner .
jones is not in his room . miss scott my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to delhi
no you cannot go ! something awful s happened . they have got short round and i think indy s been
what ?
who ?
hard to believe , is not it . . . ?
the plane crash and your journey here sound most incredible .
he is not exactly what we call a spring chicken .
no , no , that is uhmed singh , the present maharajah s late father .
they will escort you to your rooms now . you will be provided with fresh clothes . tonight you will be dining with his highness .
listen , mr . lal , what do you call the maharajah s wife ?
his highness has not yet taken a wife .
miss scott , you are not making any sense .
i sense the fumes of opium in all this . perhaps miss scott picked up the habit in shanghai .
i would say you look rather lost . but then i cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home . . .
lost ? no , we are not lost . we are on our way to delhi . this is miss scott and mr . round . my name s indiana jones .
we would appreciate it if the maharajah would let us stay tonight . we will be on out way in the morning .
i had a question , mr . prime minister . i was examining some of the maharajah s artifacts .
a very fine collection of very old pieces , do not you think ?
i suppose stories of the thuggees die hard .
there are no stories anymore .
their stories are just fear and folklore .
you know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them .
dr . jones , in our country a guest does not usually insult his host .
there , you see , captain . a rock !
when they lost this rock their fields and animals died . they also said their children were taken from them .
i was dubious myself at first . then something connected the village s rock and the old legend of the sankara stones . . .
dr . jones , we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors . i seem to remember that in honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist .
the newspapers exaggerated the incident .
and did not the sultan of madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country ?
that was a misunderstanding .
mola ram is telling the faithful of out victory . he says the british have left the palace , which proves kali ma s new power .
you understand what he tells us ?
dr . jones .
lao she .
you never told me you spoke my language , dr . jones .
so , it is true , dr . jones ? you found nurhachi ?
you have insulted my son .
next time i will cut off more than his finger .
that is that ?
now what about the antidote , lao .
wow ! holy smoke ! crash landing !
step on it , short round !
you got the tickets , short round ?
indy ?
indy , they make our plane crash ? to get you here ?
i ride with you , indy ?
indy , look !
what you look at , indy ?
that little maharajah think he big stuff .
you do not like him do you ?
next time i flatten him ! did you see his eyes ?
no .
he was afraid of you . he knows a tough guy when he sees one .
get to sleep indy i stay up and keep eye on things . . .
what does it mean , indy ?
the village knew their rock was magic but they did not know it was one of the lost sankara stones . . .
why they glow like that ?
this is nainsukh from the village . they bring him here to dig in the mines .
come one , that is wrong ?
slow on the curves or we will fly off the tracks !
let up on the brake !
you were caught trying to steal the sankara stones .
there were five stones in the beginning . over the centuries they were dispersed by wars , sold off by thieves like you . . .
two are still missing .
no . they are here somewhere . a century ago when the british raided this temple and butchered my people , a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs .
that is what you have got these children these slaves digging for ?
they dig for the gems to support our cause . they also search for the last two stones . soon we will have all five sankara stones and the thuggees will be all powerful !
nobody can say you do not have a vivid imagination .
that is far enough !
give me the stones !
no , the stones are mine !
on the way to delhi , you will stop at pankot .
pankot is not on the way to delhi .
you will go to palace there .
has not the pankot palace been deserted since the mutiny of ?
it is pankot palace that kills my village .
i do not understand . that is happened here ?
the evil starts in pankot . then like monsoon , it moves darkness over all country .
what evil ?
it is why krishna brought you here .
nobody brought us here . our plane crashed . we were shot down by
was the stone very smooth ? it was probably brought here from a sacred river .
long ago before my father s father .
but why would the maharajah take this sacred stone ?
you will find them when you find sivlalinga .
i like the service here .
hey , he is not a waiter . . .
look out , damn it , i need that antidote !
for crying out loud , a kid s driving the car ? !
listen , we just met for crissake ! i am not that kind of girl !
you do not look very good .
what are we going to do ? ! where are we going ? !
i will take the extra ticket . where is this plane going anyway ?
siam .
so , what are you supposed to be , a lion tamer ?
i am freezing . what do you mean , tag along ? from the minute you walked into that nightclub , you have not been able to keep your eyes off me .
are you crazy , a lift raft ? ! we are not sinking , we are crashing !
you all right ?
india . . .
what would he say ?
he told me they knew i was coming here .
what do you mean how ?
the old man saw it in a dream .
dream nightmare is more like it .
god , i am starving , but i cannot eat this . . .
took what ?
and then they took their children .
what would he say now ?
hey , willie i think you better get out now .
stark naked ? you wish . . . if you are trying to seduce me , dr . jones , this is a very primitive approach .
me seduce you ? honey , you are the one who took your clothes off . i just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water .
indy ! help me !
do not worry , i am coming in ! what is it ?
a what . . . ?
hurry , help me out of here ! what are you waiting for ? !
uh , listen willie i got a better idea .
what ? !
do not let it pull you deeper !
it is pulling me deeper !
do not let it curl around you !
listen , willie . do exactly what i tell you now .
what ? !
can you move your arm ?
just one arm !
okay , i want you to lift your hand and pet the snake .
pet it ? ? ! !
yes , stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae .
the what ? !
oh my god it is going to crush me !
that is happening ?
it is starting to let go !
thanks for nothing ! i hate snakes !
where would you find your little bodyguard ?
shorty s family was killed when they bombed shanghai . he was living on the streets .
by the way , how would you end up in shanghai ?
what about the future ?
i would like to find one of those myself .
oh really ?
yeah , but he is got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years . fortune and glory . . .
is that what you are hoping to find at this palace , dr . jones ?
the drawing shows a priest named sankara who lived centuries ago .
what does the writing say ?
it is sanskrit . it tells the story of sankara climbing mt . kalisa where he met the hindu god shiva .
that is shiva ? that is he giving the priest ?
legend says he told sankara to go forth and combat evil . to do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers .
i think you should sleep closer . i meant for safety .
could not keep away , huh ?
he is afraid of something .
he said he could not take us any farther . he has to go sell the elephants .
any more complaints ?
i have always had a weakness for folk dancing .
that is the maharajah that kid ? !
cheer up , you lost your prince , but dinner s on the way .
not leftovers ?
you are nice . listen , i am taking applications how would you like to be my palace slave ?
yeah and nothing else . that shock you ?
primitive sexual practices ?
you are dying to come into my room , are not you ?
you want me so bad , why do not you invite me ?
too proud to admit you are crazy about me , dr . jones ?
we will see who gives in first i will leave my door open .
do not catch cold .
five minutes . . . you will be back over here in five minutes . . .
no do not you see crawling
get the bug off !
oh no oh no ! !
you know , willie , i will bet he is mad because they were eating his friends for dinner .
what ? !
willie ? !
there s bugs ! bugs all over ! help ! help me !
get us out ! willie , shut up and listen ! there s got to be a fulcrum release ! look around !
a fulcrum release lever !
there s a hole ! i found a square hole !
that is it the release lever look inside !
oh god , it is soft it is moving !
what is it . . . ?
oh my god ! he ripped out his he killed him !
let s go ! let s get out of here !
wait what are you doing ?
i am going down .
down ? down there ? ! are you crazy !
i am not leaving without those stones .
you are gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory !
it is okay . you are all right now .
what ?
you have got to go to sleep now .
i want to go home . . .
indy ? did you talk to them ?
yes .
so now they believe me .
i was scared to death last night when i thought they were going to kill you .
no . . . they will not kill me .
what are we going to do ? !
i cannot !
let her go ! our only chance is outrunning them !
anymore ideas . . . ?
i guess mola ram got what he wanted .
the last sankara stone .
and they do not even know what it really is .
well , you did not get your prince , and there goes your diamond .
you did not do so well yourself . finding that stone could have gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about .
i get it !
this is the first time anybody ever cried when i left .
they do not cry about you . they cry about the elephants leaving .
figures . . .
give me your hat . . .
what for ?
i do not appreciate being cooked like a french fry !
i said something .

let me tell you something , lowell . look , look , look . you are talking about two agents in a regional office in louisville . i got the goddamn unabomber threatening to blow up lax ! i gotta move agents from all over the country into l . a . alright ? when i get a chance , i will give it a look . . .

we will give you a heads up before we launch .
how long ?

you bet we are . and i cannot talk to you now .
we gotta hook up .
sure . where ?
p . j . s .
whengs your deadline ?
monday .
push it .
what ? forget it .
it is a smear campaign , charlie .
it is drawn from a selectively circulated . . .
oh , it is real selective . . . about as hard to get a hold of as the manhattan phone book .
well , it is authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented .
and it is bullshit . and if i am right , are you going to put the journal s reputation behind a story that is going to blow up in your face ?
are you all right ?
these are their leads , their sources . i want you to have your reporters . . .
suein hwang and milo geyelin .
i want you to get legal onto corporate confidentiality agreements . boundaries of their constraint . kentucky state law about . i want you to drop everything .
what does that do ?
what do you mean , that is it do ?
what i mean is , like , how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement ?
shit . . .
oh , we need cops on the street . we do not need them on horses .
i do not know what he was thinking .
oh , for god s sake , what has this guy got , a horse fetish ?
alright , alright .
whengs the air date ?
excuse me , lowell . sharongs on line .
what was that about ?
get me wigand .
sure .
i cannot get out of here til mid morning . i will be in tomorrow night . . . listen , could you call a number for me , it is in mississippi . . .
yeah . yeah , sure . i will see if i can find him . hold on . . . yeah , dongs looking for you . . .
good .
can i go to dance tomorrow ? i am better . . .
do you want more rice ?
maybe later .
what are you cooking ?
i am cooking pasta primavera .
i heard wigand s deposition got sealed .
tortious interference ? sounds like a disease caught by a radio .
since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on minutes ?
yeah , i heard rumors .
are you suggesting that she and eric are influenced by money ?
oh , no , of course they are not influenced by money . they work for free . and you are a volunteer executive producer .
cbs does not do that . and , you are questioning our journalistic integrity ? !
no , i am questioning your hearing ! you hear reasonable and tortious interference . i hear . . . potential brown williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of cbs to westinghouse . i hear . . . shut the segment down . cut wigand loose . obey orders . and fuck off . . . ! that is what i hear .
you are exaggerating !
i am ? you pay me to go get guys like wigand , to draw him out . to get him to trust us , to get him to go on television . i do . i deliver him . he sits . he talks . he violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement . and he is only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue , maybe the biggest , most expensive corporate malfeasance case in u . s . history . and jeffrey wigand , who s out on a limb , does he go on television and tell the truth ? yes . is it newsworthy ? yes . are we gonna air it ? of course not . why ? because he is not telling the truth ? no . because he is telling the truth . that is why we are not going to air it . and the more truth he tells , the worse it gets !
you are a fanatic . an anarchist . you know that ? if we cannot have a whole show , then i want half a show rather than no show . but oh , no , not you . you will not be satisfied unless you are putting the company at risk !
so , what are you going to do ?
well , what do you think i am going to do ? quit in protest ? i am not going to do that .
you are taking no for an answer ?
no . i am not going to take no for an answer . no .
i am staying right here . doing my job . fighting to get my show on the air . you do not like it ? hey , i will tell you what . . . fire my ass . . .
what the hell are you doing ?
what does it look like i am doing ? i am editing .
no , not that . i am talking about the associated press . they got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to mike and i . did you tell them that we were lying ?
no . i should have . i told them i disagreed with you , mike and kluster that this segment is as good as the original . i am not lying for you . i am not gonna shut up for you . not on any of it .
the new york times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors ! you fucked us !
there has been so much soul searching about this wigand , i have decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview .
so , what happened to ms . caperelli s checking with outside counsel first , all that crap ?
that is happening . and , hopefully we will not have to use the alternate , but we should have it in the can .
i am not touching my film . . .
i am afraid you are .
no , i am not . . .
so , now , if you will excuse me , gentlemen , mr . rather s been complaining about his chair again . as they start to leave . . .
and what are you implying ?
did you handle the round , mr . wigand ?
a gun ? yes .
what caliber is your gun ?
what caliber is my gun ?
yes , sir . what caliber is your gun ?
you think i put that bullet in the mailbox myself . . . ?
that bullet was for a . caliber . do you own a . ?
yes , i do . a . target master . in my gun safe downstairs . a . gold cup . a . target pistol . so what ?
do you have a history of emotional problems , mr . wigand ?
you cannot take that . . . it is personal property . . . !
we have a search warrant , mr . wigand . there s been a death threat .
that computer has everything . . .
debbie . . .
oh , bill . . . main justice is investigating a major new york bank . laundering narco dollars out of their mexico city branch . you want it for the evening news ?
what about you , you got a crew already ?
i am gonna do a follow up .
okay .
shall i send for coffee ? sorry i am late .
no , no , we are fine . . .
if this holds up , and it very well may not , mike . . . but , if it did . and we aired this segment ? and cbs was sued by brown williamson ? i think we could be at grave risk .
how grave ?
mike . . . mike . . . mike . . .
what does that mean ? rife with ?
i am told unusual promises were made to wigand .
no , only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him . . .
and , i am told there are questions as to our star witness veracity .
his veracity was good enough for the state of mississippi .
well , as a standard . . . i will hang with is the guy telling the truth ?
well , with tortious interference , i am afraid . . . the greater the truth , the greater the damage .
come again ?
they own the information he is disclosing . the truer it is , the greater the damage to them . if he lied , he did not disclose their information . and the damages are smaller .
is cbs corporate telling cbs news do not go to air with this story ?
hey , lowell .
how are you , jim ?
hi , baby .
how prominent ? what kind of placement ?
oh , c mon , lowell . this is the new york times . i do not know . . .
well , until you do , all i can tell you is what you already know . . . they will not air an interview .
hello ?
here s how it works . you ask me questions . i tell you if you are wrong .
okay . lowell ?
yeah ?
you are sure you want to do this ?
why ?
hey , it does not work ? you have burned your bridges , man .
you ready . . . ?
lowell ?
did i tell you you were wrong ?
i can take her .
do not you have to be at the office ?
is there any more rice . . . ?
i am sorry , darling , have you seen my coffee mug . . . ?
uh , what are those boxes ?
i am going to the store . you need anything ?
what do you need at the store ?
soy sauce . . .
right now ?
that is my stuff from the office . . .
why did you take your stuff from the office ?
i did not want to leave it there . . .
i do not understand .
i got fired this morning . . . where else am i gonna take it ?
why ? who said ?
thomas sandefur . . .
there s a severance agreement . . . it includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage . . . sure you do not need anything ?
that is going on ?
. . . taping ? what are you taping ?
i am doing an interview .
please do not wash your hands in the sink .
where should i wash them ?
use the bathroom .
that is the difference . . .
i do not think i can do this . . . i want to stand by my husband . . . i really do , jeffrey . but i do not think i can do this anymore . i am so sorry . . .
can we talk about this when i get back ?
thank you , bob .
who s calling ?
my name s lowell bergman . . . i am
did you say berman ?
no , bergman . . . b . e . r . g . m . a . n . . . . i am a producer with minutes . . .
minutes ?
yeah .
minutes , the television show ?
oh , someone took a poll ? are all things canadian boring . . . ?
it is stuart . . . he is in mexico city . . .
no classes this morning ?
will independent sources corroborate that ?
let me see this . . . no , cause i gotta know where you are going at all times .
two p . m . great . bye bye .
. . . no . . . this looks like a table of temperatures . . . who s this from ?
. . . it is anonymous . references to p . m . it is got to be philip morris , huh ?
that is wrong ?
they are killing the wigand interview . . .
what ? !
they are pretending it is process . bullshit , it is foregone .
what are you and mike going to do ?
i am alone on this . . .
jeffrey wigand . . .
i am lowell bergman , i am from minutes . you know , you take the minutes out of that sentence , nobody returns your phone call . maybe wigand s right . maybe i am hooked . what am i hooked on ? the rush ? minutes ? what the hell for ? infotainment . it is so fucking useless , all of it .
so , it is a big country with a free press . you can go work somewhere else .
free press ? press is free . . . for anyone who owns one . larry tisch has a free press .
get some perspective , lowell .
i got perspective .
no , you do not .
from my perspective , that is been going on and what i have been doing is ridiculous . it is half measures .
yeah . . .
. . . you fucked me !
is it too late ?
oh , my god .
you are not even on this anymore . . . what do you care ?
yes , i am right here . could you call me back on a hard line ?
alright .
area code .
. . . you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the state of mississippi , did you not ?
that is right . . .
well , i am working with someone , now , who was the former head of research at brown williamson , a former corporate officer there .
that is your interest in this , mr . bergman ?
has he decided to go public ? because let me tell you , we have been doing this for three years now , and we have worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle blowers , so we know . . . big tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him . so , is your man truly committed ?
well , we would certainly be interested in making his acquaintance , but without knowing what he is going to do . . .
well , would you want him to call you ? or , you want to call him ? how do you want to do it ?
it would be better if he called us .
yeah .
alright ?
yeah , i am here .
. . . i would be lying to you if i did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion . . .
. . . and i would be lying to you if i did not tell you , i am about out of moves , dick . . .
we are there .
good , well ask him if arabic is his second language .
. . . come in earlier on mike s marine barracks line when he is talking to sheikh mussawi . . .
you eating with us ?
yeah .
he referred to this . . . the seven dwarfs . . .
what seven dwarfs ?
well , it is not cigarettes are bad for you . . .
hardly new news .
no shit .
okay , let s look through the looking glass the other way . . .
what do you mean ?
we got a guy . . . who wants to talk but he is constrained . what if he were compelled ?
so , is everything okay ?
thank you for saying that . . .
do you think we could talk about the taping ? tomorrow s taping , just so we can get it out of the way and order . . .
oh , man .
who are these people ?
it went great in mississippi , mike .
i think what we are trying to tell you is that it happens all the time . this is a news organization . people are always telling us things they should not . we have to verify if it is true and in the public interest . . . and if it is , we air it .
i discovered this . sec filing . . . for the sale of the cbs corporation to westinghouse corporation .
lowell .
put the corporation at risk . . . ? give me a fucking break !
lowell .
these people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do . . . on the line !
lowell !
what ?
i have been banished . in lieu of being fired .
i took off on tisch . i took off on corporate . they will know they are not going to see everything on sunday night . . .
i do not know . how does that get wigand on the air ?
yeah .
you disappeared on me . how long you staying ?
i disappeared on you ?
alright . what did you think ?
did i get you up ?
how many shows have we done ? huh ? c mon , how many ?
oh , lots .
yeah , that is right .
but in all that time , mike , did you ever get off a plane , walk into a room , and find that a source for a story changed his mind ? lost his heart ? walked out on us ? not one fucking time ! you want to know why ?
i see a rhetorical question on the horizon .
i am going to tell you why . because when i tell someone i am going to do something , i deliver .
oh , how fortunate i am to have lowell bergmangs moral tutelage to point me down the shining path . to show me the way .
oh , please , mike . . .
give me a break !
no , you give me a break ! i never left a source hung out to dry , ever . abandoned . not til right fucking now ! when i came on this job , i came with my word intact . i am gonna leave with my word intact . fuck the rules of the game ! hell , you are supposed to know me , mike . what the hell did you expect ? you expect me to lie down ? back off ? what , get over it ?
in the real world , when you get to where i am , there are other considerations . . .
like what ? corporate responsibility ? what , are we talking celebrity here ?
mike . . . in my . . .
that canada story ? still interest you ?
c mon , it all worked out . you came out okay in the end . . .
coffee ?
yeah . . . thank you .
how have you liked your stay ?
please to explain , why i should agree to interview . . . with pro zionist american media ?
perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and i see the questions first . then i decide if i grant the interview .
tell him i will see him day after tomorrow .
who s that ?
how do you like your coffee ? black ?
look , i really do not have that much time . . .
is there anything you want to know about me , mr . wigand . . . ?
i know what i have to know .
just so i know you know , when i talk to people in confidence , it stays that way .
. . . but that is as far as i go . . .
far as you go where ?
does not cbs have confidentiality agreements , mr . bergman ?
between journalists and management , yes , i believe they do . . . but i do not take that seriously . where do you work ?
did work .
did work .
how much would i get paid ?
should i just take the documents now ?
. . . protect your sources . . . ! you screwed me ! you sold me out !
what are you talking about ? where are you ?
mrs . wigand , how do you do ?
jump in , quick , c mon . . .
c mere . i want to talk to you .
what do . . .
i did not burn you . i did not give you up to anyone !
this is my house . . . in front of my wife , my kids ? ! what business do we have ?
to straighten something out with you . right here . right now .
so , you did not mention my name ? you have not talked to anybody about me ?
why am i gonna mention your name ?
how did brown williamson know i spoke to you . . . ?
how the hell do i know about brown williamson ?
it happened after i talked to you . i do not like coincidences !
and i do not like paranoid accusations ! i am a journalist . think . use your head . how do i operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it ?
you came all the way down here to tell me that ?
and , i am unemployed . so i have to protect my medical coverage . . . . so i left them a message this morning . their expanded confidentiality agreement ? i will sign it .
they are afraid of you , are not they ?
talk to me outside the zone of your agreement ?
like what ?
like where would you work before brown williamson ?
johnson johnson . union carbide in japan . i was general manager and director of new products . i speak japanese . i was a director of corporate development at pfizer . all health related . what else ? outside the zone . . . ?
seven dwarfs ?
the seven ceos of big tobacco . . . they got up in front of congress that time . . . it was on television . . .
. . . and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction , disease . . .
it was on c span . yeah .
okay , so , here you are . . . you go to work for tobacco . you come from corporate cultures where research , really , creative thinking , these are core values . you go to tobacco . . . tobacco is a sales culture . market and sell enormous volume . go to a lot of golf tournaments . the hell with everything else . what are you doing ? why are you working for tobacco in the first place ?
i have always thought of myself . . . as a man of science . that is that is wrong with it .
the new place ? new .
you know , i was thinking of calling you tomorrow , anyway . how are your kids handling the new house ?
no , you said you were going to call me tomorrow . so , what about ?
oh , yes , yes , yes , i did . . . i wanted to talk to you . i wanted to hook up and talk to you . about what we were talking about in your car .
. . . okay .
how would you know that , lowell ?
hello . you there
yeah . . . look , thanks for talking . i am sorry i woke you up .
what did you get us ?
the internet said you did graduate work in wisconsin , then went to uc la jolla with professor . . . marcus ?
marcuse . yeah . he was my mentor . he had a major influence on the new left in the late s . . . and on me , personally .
next to your father ?
my father ? what the hell s that got to do with my father ?
is that why you became a journalist ? then you get to ask all the questions ?
you charge by the hour ?
my father was a mechanical engineer . . . most ingenious man i ever knew .
well , my father left us when i was five years old . he was not the most ingenious man i ever knew . . . let s get back to brown williamson . if you decide to go on minutes , i got to know everything about why you got fired .
why ?
they are gonna dig up stuff from your past , they are gonna throw it at you . i got to know what they are gonna throw . you understand ?
i drink . a couple of occasions more than i should have . i was cited for shoplifting once . but it was a mistake . . . i pushed liane one time . we were both stressed out because of the pressure . she went to her mother s . i got fired because when i get angry i have difficulty censoring myself . and i do not like to be pushed around !
i am not pushing you around ! i am asking you questions .
i am just a commodity to you , are not i ? i could be anything . right ? anything worth putting on between commercials . . .
you believe that ?
no .
you should . because when you are done , a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion , my friend . and that is the power you have .
you believe that ?
i believe that ? yes , i believe that .
you believe that because you get information out to people . . . something happens ?
yes .
maybe that is just what you have been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job ? having status ? and maybe for the audience , it is just voyeurism ? something to do on a sunday night . and maybe it will not change a fucking thing . and people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry . used up ! broke , alone !
are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here ? ! i never abandoned a source !
i do not think you really understand
no , do not evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or minutes with this cheap skepticism !
i have to put my family s welfare on the line here , my friend ! and what are you putting up ? you are putting up words !
excuse me . yeah . . .
jeff , call the fbi right away . . .
they do this with impunity !
jeff . . .
good . but jeff . . .
liane , this is a preliminary . . . you did not tell her we were taping ? what did she think she was coming to new york for ?
lowell , i cannot afford
i called richard scruggs in mississippi . . .
i heard .
i am going to be a witness for them in their litigation . so i am going to fly to pascagoula to give a deposition . . .
i know . i am going to go there tonight . . .
you attract a crowd .
yeah , great .
i heard about the kentucky gag order . . .
that is changed ?
you mean . . . since this morning ?
part of the reason i am here is i felt that their representation clearly , at least within . . .
i do not know how to say this , jeff , except to just say it right out , so i will say it . they do not want to air it .
what ? !
b w may have threatened litigation . . . cbs is on the block . . . but you , i mean , i know how . . .
no .
no ? no , what ?
oh , you know what we do or do not need to know ? since when have you become a media expert ?
i told the truth !
. . . i was young . i was young . . . confused . . . we did not handle it the right way . . .
she sued you for back payments of child support ?
yes . did you lie about being on the american judo team in the olympics ?
what ?
some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview . . . where you are saying you were on the american judo team in the olympics . . . ?
alright . . . the abc telemarketing company ?
abc . . . ?
abc telemarketing company .
that is the whole point , jeffrey . that is the whole point . anyone s . everyone s . they are gonna look under every rock , dig up every flaw , every mistake you have ever made . they are going to distort and exaggerate everything you have ever done , man . do not you understand ?
what does this have to do with my testimony ?
that is not the point .
what does this have to do with my testimony ? ! i told the truth ! it is valid and true and provable !
that is not the fucking point , whether you told the truth or not ! hello . . . ?
i have got to teach class . i have got to go . i have got to teach class .
you manipulated me into this . . . !
that is bullshit , jeff !
you greased the rails !
i greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes . i helped him to say yes . alright . you are not a robot , jeff ! that is all . you got a mind of your own , do not you ?
up to you , jeffrey . that is the power you have , jeffrey . vital insider information the american public need to know . lowell bergman , the hot show who never met a source he could not turn around .
i fought for you . . . and i still fight for you .
you fought for me . . . ? ! . . . you manipulated me . . . into where i am now . . . staring at the brown williamson building . it is all dark . except the th floor ! that is the legal department . that is where they fuck with my life !
where are you , anyway ?
i am on a leave of absence . forced vacation .
you try and have a good time .
i think i need to call the police . he will not respond . . .
did he hear you ?
what about now ?
what ?
that is happening ? !
he does not seem to be listening . . .
alright , now listen to me . i want you i want you to tell him , in these words get on the fucking phone . . . !
i cannot say that !
just give me an example . . .
we have a couple . one s hers , one s mine . everybody uses a different name . modern marriage . how is liane ?
hold on a minute , lowell . . . . . . somebody . . . may be following me . i do not know . they came on the property . . .
what do you mean followed you ? did you call the police ?
i do not want to be paranoid . . . i mean , maybe it is a game . some kind of mind game .
well , what do you really think , though ?
well , no , look . . . i mean , there was a footprint . forget it . it is probably not important at all . you know , i got a job now . i am teaching high school . japanese and chemistry . so , what were you calling about ?
what are you talking about ?
i heard you . but i got to arrange a legal defense first . i got to get you to testify in court , get it on public record .
jeffrey , how are you ? how is the family , okay ?
there is there is no family .
what do you mean there is no family ?
and , so , i moved out . . . i see the girls a couple of days a week . . .
where you staying now ?
jeff wigand , michael moore .
good to meet you , dr . wigand .
mike s our attorney general down here . i was just explaining to jeff , they got a kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today .
right .
now , they tried to get the mississippi court to honor it , but the judge threw it out . . . however , for you , there is a more perilous effect to the kentucky gag order . . .
you heard mr . sandefur say before congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive . . . ?
all of us did . there was this whole line of people . . . whole line of ceos up there all swearing .
part of the reason i am here is i felt that their representation clearly misstated , at least within brown williamsongs representation , clearly misstated . . . what is common language within the company . . . we are in the nicotine delivery business .
and that is what cigarettes are for . . . ?
a delivery device for nicotine .
a delivery device for nicotine . put it in your mouth , light it up , and you are gonna get your fix . . .
you are gonna get your fix . . .
you are saying that brown williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix , not by artificially adding nicotine , but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia . . .
the process is known as impact boosting . . . while not spiking nicotine , they clearly manipulate it . there s extensive use of this technology , know as ammonia chemistry . it allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system .
the straw that broke the camel s back for me and really put me in trouble with sandefur was a compound called coumarin . when i came on board at b w , they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste , and had been unsuccessful . i wanted it out immediately . i was told that it would affect sales , so i should mind my own business . i constructed a memo to mr . sandefur indicating i could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew , we had documentation , was similar to coumadin , a lung specific carcinogen . . .
and you sent the document forward to sandefur ?
i sent the document forward to sandefur . i was told that we would continue to work on a substitute , we were not going to remove it as it would impact sales , and that that was his decision .
in other words , you were charging sandefur and brown williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously . . .
most certainly .
and on march , thomas sandefur , ceo of brown williamson had you fired . and the reason he gave you ?
poor communication skills .
and , do you wish you had not come forward ? you wish you had not blown the whistle ?
i would bet on it .
you wish you had not blown the whistle ?
object to the form of the question !
it acts as a drug on the body ?
object to the form !
it acts as a . . .
object !
there an echo in here ? your objectiongs been recorded . she typed it into her little machine over there . it is on the record . so now i will proceed with my deposition of my witness . does it act as a drug ?
dr . wigand . i am instructing you . . . . . . not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the brown williamson tobacco company . and in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the state of kentucky ! that means you do not talk ! mr . motley , we have rights , here . . .
hello .
mr . scruggs , jeff wigand . lowell bergman said i should give you a call . . .
my co counsel , ron motley , and i have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the state of mississippi to get the state reimbursed medicaid costs for treating people with smoking related illness . if you would be interested in talking to us , we would certainly like to talk to you . . .
jail ?
possibly , yes . that is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today . that is right . . .
jeff s a premiere golfer . . . what are you , a two handicap ?
seven . . .
and , he gets out there and he has five strokes on us . he has more concentration than anybody i have ever met . it is spooky how he can concentrate .
jeffrey says exactly that is on his mind . most people consider what they are saying . . . social skills . . . jeffrey just charges right ahead . now , i know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with brown williamson , jeff . . .
chapter and verse .
is that a threat ?
. . . we worked together for , what was it , three years . . . ? now , the work we did here is confidential , not for public scrutiny . . . any more than are one s family matters . . .
you threatening my family , now , too ?
now , do not be paranoid , jeff . about the direction of research here , we may have had our differences of opinion . . .
research . . . you declare , as a badge of honor , you do not even know what makes water boil . . .
that is why we hire scientists . . .
okay . i do not believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements . i was paid well for my work . the health and welfare benefits are good . the severance package is fair . i have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which i said i would not .
yes . your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures . and , yes , absent a swimming pool , the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious . but bonnie , who is the real victim here ? let me suggest the following . your husband , who on a prior occasion slapped you beat you
well , i would not say
your husband , who has beaten you repeatedly
he
please was at the time brandishing your firearm , trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance friend of long standing
they hate each other
miles , how nice of you to see us may i introduce howard d . doyle of doyle oil .
yeah . i know . leather would be more practical , but whatcha gonna do ?
sixteen years ? howard jr . is fourteen and mandy must be what twelve ?
honey , i do not think this is really relevant to . . .
. . . and one day , this sweet girl calls me , asks me to lunch . just a shoulder to cry on deal . one thing leads to another and before i know it
baby . you are so hot !
as you are well aware , my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation my motives were questioned . i was slandered in court .
you did good , massey !
therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet howard i wish to execute a pre nuptial agreement .
and there s no talking her out of it . believe me , i have tried .
they say the massey pre nup has never been penetrated .
course i cannot do much wriggling if you tie me up like that again . massey this is one bad bad little girl .
oh . right . will not you have a seat ?
and how is mrs . reiser ?
few suicide attempts , little inpatient stint . naturally , she misses her kids . six weekends a year and alternate yom kippurs seemed harsh to us but hey all s fair . anyhoo , she lives with a nurse , takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop .
so she is uh , flourishing ?
muh well , uh huh ?
i . . . uh guess congratulations are in order .
no !
what a touching story .
harvard ? whoa , daddy !
understand what you are asking for here . the massey pre nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason , both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in , and earned during . no one can profit from the marriage . the pre nup protects the wealthier party .
well at the moment , that would be me .
and without it , that party is exposed a sitting duck . no wriggle room .
a wriggle room ! maybe we should put that in the malibu house . screw the screening room !
excuse me , mr . doyle , if i could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment .
what part ?
i would just like to have a word with her .
i am here representing mr . dumbarton , on a . . . matter of some delicacy .
who s the pigeon ?
excuse me ?
who do you want me to kill ?
well i , uh , that is to say mr . dumbarton would like you to uh , neutralize a , uh , business associate by the name of marylin rexroth doyle massey uh dumbart uh , massey .
is that . . . one person ?
you are in a rush .
whoever sent you , i will pay double .
is this mr . dumbarton ?
that is his lawyer .
triple !
you are calling me a pestilence ? that is a hoot !
lemme tell you something . you are the pestilence . i am the exterminator .
well , actually , all whores worship the dollar , if you want to get technical .
objection , your honor !
grounds ?
who s next , mrs . rabinow .
we rest , your honor .
objection , your honor . this is not about mrs . rexroth s filial obligations .
she got absolutely nothing . zero . zip .
so . i will not be seeing her ? your clients usually visit me after the settlement .
not this one . not unless her hmo covers plastic surgery , which , incidentally , she does not need .
everyone needs plastic surgery . you need it .
i do not need it .
you want botox ?
what the hell is botox ?
it is a form of botulism . i just inject it into your forehead , and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you cannot raise them . . .
why in god s name would i want . . . ?
no frown lines . new watch ?
it is a lecoultre revers . you can flip the face , and set it for two time zones .
why would you need two time zones ? you never leave beverly hills .
it was a gift from a client .
set one side for bel air .
botox . christ . we had aspirations when we were in college .
we did not .
you were going to be a cardiac surgeon . i was going to clerk for the supreme court .
i was going to play golf . you were going to have asian girlfriends .
you are in check .
do you think i am going to end up like herb myerson , with a colostomy bag instead of a family ?
got any symptoms ?
yes . the inability to experience pleasure .
oh . that . do not waste time with your queen .
what ?
the center counter defense . the thing is not to move your queen too early .
she cannot really love that idiot , can she ?
what ?
marylin rexroth . she came into my office and signed a pre nup with howard doyle .
doyle oil ? a massey pre nup ? she loves him .
he is the wrong man .
i am happy for you , pal .
thanks , buddy .
is she asian ?
asian ? no .
i have it .
you have the pre nup ?
no . i have the ring . was i supposed to have a pre nup ?
no . you have the ring . wrigley has the pre nup .
they will not get a conviction . the husband called it in as a suicide . the forensic guys were not thinking murder . i am sure some of the evidence was compromised .
it is your move , miles .
my god .
what ?
that was marvin untermeyer .
yes ?
he was rex rexroth s personal attorney .
what do you mean , was .
i am sorry to hear that . but you were not close , were you ?
marvin says that rex s will is four years old . he never redrafted it .
she is rich . we are still married . we have no pre nup .
who was that ?
that was oh , shit . what if he is on his way over there ?
marylin ! what have i done ?
mrs . guttman , you have testified that you were your husband s sexual slave for thirty six years , ever since you were married
except for two years when he was in the navy , in korea .
prior to your marriage , what was your profession ?
i was a hostess . for trans world airlines .
what is your husband s profession ?
so who would you hire ?
you should have tried to get pregnant marylin solidify your position .
no .
you like kids .
it was like that scene in the godfather . frankie pentangeli is called to testify against the family . and he is in court , and he looks into the spectators gallery , and sees his brother . they brought the brother from sicily . and frankie cannot say a word . he cannot testify . that is what it was like seeing pat in there . i could not even have ruth cross examine her .
why do you think she did it ?
maybe she wanted a free trip to la . maybe they offered her money . massey is very seductive . who knows .
i begged you to have a baby !
you are vulnerable .
you said yes did not you ?
is tong older than ming ?
well . he said to make the house mine .
oh boy . if he only knew .
it sounded like a bell .
ruth rabinow , this is rex rexroth . and you must be mrs . rexroth .
how nice .
these are yours .
i assume this is on rex ?
your husband told me you were beautiful , but i was unprepared .
do you have a hard heart , marylin .
did you see the tape ?
not yet .
tell me mr . massey . what was your performance about this afternoon ?
what does your lawyer think ?
ruth says you have been too successful , that you are bored , complacent , and you are on your way down .
but you do not agree ?
how do you know ?
why would you be here ?
i will have the tournedos of beef . and the lady will have the same ? i assume you are a carnivore .
who ever lov would that lov would not at first sight ?
you did not ask me here to pick me up . you could get in trouble for that .
not really . you are not my client . freedom of association . big issue with the first amendment fans . want to go to hawaii for the weekend ?
have you ever been married , miles ?
no .
you do not believe in it .
as a matter of fact , i am a huge fan .
you just have not met the right person .
all right , miles . let me tell you everything you think you know . i was married to rex for a long time . i was an excellent wife , a partner , a lover , a hostess and a friend . there was only one thing i did wrong during the five years we were together . i got five years older . think he should be able to ditch me for that ?
he wants a reconciliation .
see the tape . then we can discuss reconciliation . rex screwed up and i nailed his ass . now i am going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it . then i am getting on with my life . that is all i am after .
gotcha .
what is it you are after , miles ?
oh , i am a lot like you just looking for an ass to mount .
yes . i loved my husband , rex .
and you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him ?
he will regret this .
oh , for the love of . . .
that is true , is not it miles ? your pre nup is the best there is ?
we are both sure that is what we want ?
getting married .
to him ? he is a sick freak .
he is passionate .
passionate ! he is a pervert . he should have to register when he moves .
all girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time .
marylin ! listen to me .
no . you listen to me . you busted me , miles . you left me with nothing ! what did you expect me to do ? get a degree in counseling ? write a book about table linen ? because that is what wives do when they get dumped , and frankly , i am not quite ready for that .
but why him ?
the massey pre nup has never been pene successfully challenged .
so i hear . is that all ?
i would like to offer my congratulations . that was a beautiful gesture of howard s .
howard is a beautiful person .
yes . he is a diamond in the rough . and i have a feeling that someday soon you will be taking that diamond and leaving the rough .
miles . miles . miles .
i am thrilled for you , but tell me this . . . how would you get howard to do it ? i have addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion , but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea .
it was his idea . it was a gesture of love and trust . be happy for me , miles .
well , when this goes south promise you will have dinner with me ?
have you tried the duck ?
it has bones . be sure to swallow one .
to victory .
i do not feel victorious miles . i feel betrayed , abandoned and humiliated . i have pictures of him with another woman . . .
more pictures ? my god , marylin . you can open an erotic art gallery .
did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs .
no . just to comfort you , and appreciate you
hello ?
miles ?
yes ? marylin ?
you are right about me . i am worthless . i am nothing . i do not deserve to live .
marylin ? when did i say . . . ?
screw you , asswipe !
marylin ? forgive me but are you drunk ?
a little . you get out of the car . that is right , fuctard . i am talking to you !
you should not be driving . where are you ?
i am on sunset . near the beverly hills hotel . wanna meet me for a drink in the polo . . . ?
i live right near there . the block of maple . come here . marylin come here right now before just come here .
okay . should i stop at starbucks and pick up a blended for
no . do not stop .
you have a very nice home , miles . very inviting .
thank you .
you have wonderful art . i love that lithograph . hockney ?
yes . i just got that , actually . it was a gift .
from a girlfriend .
no . no . i do not have a . . . no . it was from a client .
no kidding . i will bet you have some very grateful clients . what would rex buy you ?
is that you ?
me . yes .
oh . and that is mom ?
yeah . mom . mom and brother .
hmmm . . .
and your mother was very beautiful . she must be proud of you .
she never particularly cared for me .
she did not love you ?
no . she loved me . she would never not love her son . she just did not . . . i was not her type . she said i was a very , colicky baby . you know ? difficult . not a good sleeper ? did not eat well ? we got off to a bad start , and she never seemed to recoup
she held that against you ?
apparently she was very disappointed .
and here i thought my mother was . . .
your mother was .
we are damaged goods .
no , we are not !
we are , miles . you know i am right . there s something off about you and me miles . and maybe it is not because of these women maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our deficiencies very early on . maybe . . .
that is bullshit ! mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho . i cannot believe you are saying this , marylin ! there s nothing wrong with us . we are attractive and charismatic and successful and . . . i like us .
i am sorry miles . you should not listen to me . i am sure you have a very fulfilling life . i would better go . i am depressing .
no .
friends ?
i have to say i am speechless . no . i am never speechless .
i am a little embarrassed . i am not used to losing control with such volume .
and i am not used to marylin there s something i want to ask you .
what is it miles ?
i want to be your your wife .
huh ?
no . . . that was not right . i want you to be my wife .
did you just propose to me ?
yes . i am . what else could those words mean ? i believe we belong together and we can make one another happy . and we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is just jump in any old time , marylin . you have more experience at this than i do .
yes .
yes ? yes , you do have more experience ?
yes , miles . i accept .
you do ?
do you want me to sleep on it ?
no .
do you want to sleep on it ?
no ma am . i have been asleep all my life up to this moment . marylin , will you marry me ?
i do not have a ring !
i know .
was not she the judge at my divorce hearing ?
no . judge just a sec . but marylin , if we sign it , i cannot hope to benefit from the marriage .
oh miles !
but ?
i am sorry . i am squishing you . i will move to the . . .
honey , i could sit . . .
in fact , this is not a married house it is a bachelor pad .
hardly . you have six bedrooms
here s my card . spend as much as you want . we get mileage .
well , i suppose i could girly it up for you with a little fortuny , and some passementerie
good . are those foods ?
fabric and fringe .
exactly . and then maybe not right away there s a room right off the bedroom it would be perfect for a nursery . it is a walk in humidor right now but if i took out the refrigeration unit
miles .
hi .
hello marylin .
i have a surprise for you .
you do not like me ?
i love you . i want to have your baby .
miles . i have a very good relationship with all the salesmen . i can return everything .
can you marylin ? can you return the trust ? can you return the hopes ? the dreams ? can you just . . . send it all back for store credit ?
miles ? you are scaring me .
well . well . well . look who made bail !
may i come in ?
i do not know . maybe i should grab my mace . i am a civil attorney . i have little experience with the criminal mind .
i would just like to pick up a few of my things
i do not believe you have things .
comfy !
what do you want ?
i want to nail you ass .
are you threatening me , because i am sure that is a violation of the terms of your bail .
i am reporting you to the irs .
i am clean with the irs . i have reported every dollar i have ever made . try again , girlfriend .
stuff . got a light ?
arty farty stuff . lithographs and pre castro cubans . watches and mileage on private jets . stuff , miles . stuff you get from grateful clients .
those are gifts .
salary . unreported income . by the way , what time is it on bellagio road ?
you cannot prove anything .
i do not have to . that is what the irs guys do . and they do it with great zeal . see , they work at these tortuous civil service jobs , and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies , these saps feel . . well , they feel like saps . and they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel wrath . what is this ? a romeo and julieta ?
you are out of your league , marylin . rexroth was a primate . i am a professional .
i know . so am i , right ? and so is agent wilson of the internal revenue service . he is a dedicated , underpaid graduate of southwestern university very tenacious , and never more so than when he is dealing with an unscrupulous colleague . i think it is only fair to warn you i am going to file an action , miles . and after a decent interval i plan to have ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within feet of my house .
meaning my house .
i believe the residence will be part of the settlement .
did our marriage ever mean anything to you ?
drop the bogus forgery charge and i will forget about your generous friends slash clients .
that is blackmail .
hello ?
marylin ?
miles ? miles ! where have you been ? i have been trying to get in touch .
you have to leave the house immediately !
i will , miles . i will leave . but miles
no buts . now . out .
just listen to me . i am sorry , miles . it is true that my initial intention was to . . .
please ! leave the house .
i fell in love miles .
so did i . now pack up a few basics and
it is a no go , joe .
marylin !
wait ! he works for you ?
now . but first , he worked for you .
you were going to have this thug . . . ?
nonono . marylin i am your husband . i would be entitled to rex s money . no matter what happened to you .
marylin . run . i will distract him .
hello marylin .
hello miles .
hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us .
it is not something i wanted either .
but then i guess something inside me died when i realized that you would hired a goon to kill me .
you wounded me first , marylin .
your forgetting rex rexroth ?
you are forgetting howard doyle ?
forgery ? fraud ?
income tax evasion ?
murder ?
murder !
pre castro .
sweet .
rex . get away from the door .
look , marylin , cannot we have a civilized discussion about this ?
we are . and it is winding down .
but marylin , you know a divorce would ruin me right now . everything i have everything we have is tied up in my business . the business is my entire life .
are you forgetting about the atcheson , topeka and the santa fe ?
marylin ?
rex . go away . i do not want to have to sic the dogs on you .
hello , rex .
marylin .
are you alright ? you lost weight .
do you need a tagamet ?
have you been taking your digestive enzymes ?
i am sorry . where were we ?
i was devastated . of course .
who s that ?
is this a lover ?
forgery and fraud ?
you used his credit card .
he told me to he said he wanted me to
quite a little shopping spree . how do you spend six figures in less than six hours ? oh , never mind i have seen it before . i have seen everything .
do you think he set me up ? do you think that was his intention ?
like i know his intention ? or yours for that matter ? i should join sam . i am too old for this bullshit .
he never even asked . he just assumed
he was right , was not he ?
so . now what ?
you want to come out to the beach house tomorrow ?
i did not know barry had a beach house .
she is a legend . did not she do kravis or a pearlman ? she definitely did a factor .
she did a harriman .
wow .
miles massey .
of massey myerson ?
do you know him ?
who s she ?
maybe .
please . i am not seeing anyone until this is over . one husband at a time .
i do not know what his game is . he dismissed every one of ruth s proposals . and sarah , we were not unreasonable .
well what does he want ?
i do not know . ruth kept her cool , but i could tell she was surprised .
lilly s up .
every week
anyway , even rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence . if i did not know better , i would swear massey had some personal investment in my ruination .
so where are you now ?
well , if he continues to maintain this position we are in court .
shit .
that stinks . they left you with absolutely nothing . it makes you wonder about the entire legal system . like rodney king .
nothing specific , but i will have my own place soon .
so , marylin . is that what you said when you were a little girl ?
you are not . . .
sarah sorkin . ramona barcelona this is miles massey .
but marylin , without this , you are completely exposed .
is this ming ?
i cannot do this anymore . let s get some lunch .
what about rugs ? i thought we were stopping at mansour ?
what ?
he is not what i expected . he is very he is so happy .
but you are going through with it ?
yes , yes , it is just you know i have never been the first wife . rex was married before me .
so what ?
miles is different . he is still so idealistic .
well , that is about to change big time .
he has no cynicism or anger . for once i am not the repository of rage at some other woman .
soon , you will have your own rage !
is not a challenge . i need something i can sink my teeth into , professionally speaking .
wait . i know you .
yes ?
you are miles massey ! you probably do not recognize me . the drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair .
excuse me ?
yes , i know howard doyle .
herb wants to see me ?
mr . massey
please ! no calls ! i am feeling very fragile .
i am sorry , mr . massey , but i felt certain you would want to know marylin rexroth wants to see you .
marylin rexroth ? when does she
so , ruth . how is sam ?
sam is sam . he is taking up fly fishing . he is in a yert in montana .
what ? !
so , miles . if you have a proposal , let s hear it .
at this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation .
my client has ruled that out .
my client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice .
that is delusional .
my client proposes a thirty day cooling off period .
my client feels sufficiently dispassionate .
my client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order .
ha ha .
so much for the icebreakers . what are you after , ruth ?
my client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets .
why only fifty percent , ruth ? why not ask for a hundred percent ?
oh brother . here we go .
why not a hundred and fifty percent ?
are you familiar with kirshner ?
. . . arty farty !
he divorced his wife he married marylin he divorced marylin and he remarried his wife ? what kind of sick
marylin was friends with howard and amanda doyle . they do not like the way you operate . they helped her .
he never ate the pre nup , did he !
i have no idea what howard doyle eats . i am not a damn dietician .
did marylin end up with money ?
she is your wife . why do not you ask her ? anyway , i assume she signed the highly over rated massey pre nup .
. . . the fault , dear brutus , is not in our stars . . .
do not give me that crap . that is my crap .
and it is good !
i will have you suspended . i will have you disbarred .
do not threaten me , miles . i did nothing illegal .
. . . why did she do it , ruth ? why ?
where does that leave us ?
mr . rexroth .
rex , please .
miles massey . please sit , relax , and consider this office your office , your haven , your war room for the duration of the campaign .
thank you .
. . . well , my wife has me between a rock and a hard place .
that is her job . you have to respect that .
when i first met marylin well , we were crazy about each other . not emotionally , of course . we just could not keep our hands off each other .
mm .
time marches on . ardor cools .
no . not exactly . it did not exactly cool . marylin is a knock out . and very sexy but there s a lot of it out there .
ah .
you know what i mean when i say it .
gotcha . no need to get anatomically correct with me , rex .
seems like there s more of it than ever before
well , with the expanding global population let me ask you this your wife . has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the knock out , sexy woman you described ?
i do not know . i can assume . . .
not in court you cannot . has she retained counsel ?
i am not sure .
and your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities ?
video .
the fault , dear brutus , is not in our stars , but in ourselves . well , let me ask you this what kind of settlement do you seek ? what are , for you , the parameters of the possible ?
that is the problem . i cannot afford to give her anything .
nothing ?
i know that sounds rough but i am about to close on a deal to develop some mini malls , and i am mortgaged up to my ass . if this deal goes south , i am ruined i will lose millions .
so , you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part , your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear ?
that is kirshner ?
i think that went as well as could be expected .
she always looked out for me .
and she had private investigators assisting her .
she brought my digestive enzymes .
in anticipation of making you sick .
wait . . . he wants to give her . . . ?
nothing .
and she has . . . ?
video .
wrigley !
sorry .
sometimes i have serious doubts about you .
i am very sorry .
am i mentoring the wrong mentee ?
no . you are not .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
i cannot help it . even with the business we are in , i it gets me every time . it is so optimistic .
what do you think ?
what are they ?
berry spoons .
spoons ! honestly wrigley , i am surprised at you . what is this ? some martha stewart suggestion ? those are the most cockamamie things i have ever
i am sorry i am late . i was having lunch with ruth rabinow s assistant . guess what ? marylin rexroth is divorced !
ha !
. . . and i hear she is richer than croesus .
ah , but is she richer than mrs . croesus ?
she could buy and sell you ten times over .
get me marylin rexroth doyle .
what . . . ?
she owes me a meal .
i would stay away from her , miles .
wrigley ?
miles .
kenneth this is my associate , wrigley . wrigley this is my friend , dr . beck .
the plastic surgeon ! i read about you in la style .
i tried to reach ruth , but we could not get her .
we wanted ruth here for your protection as well
yes . it is for your protection , sweetheart . you are the one with the the . . .
extinguish ?
now , mrs . banderas . what is your relationship to mrs . rexroth .
and how would you define your relationship to mrs . rexroth . you know you are her . . . ?
hi , sweetie .
no . i have not . but i have been out of town . hello , rex . hello there .
you were never invited to meet your son in law ?
did you know mrs . rexroth was married ?
let me tell you something about patty .
who s patty .
oh . that is her name . patricia . like mine . i was pat and she was patty . but she changed it after seeing some like it hot . to marylin . after marylin monroe .
i see . and what were you going to tell us about patty slash marylin ?
divorce was her childhood aspiration ?
i have been trying to nail george s for years , but he is very careful . i will just keep having children . i think i am pregnant , by the way .
ramona ! do not get mia farrow on us .
three is not farrow .
george was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second .
it is not so bad these days . kids like joint custody . two sets of toys .
thorstenson gieselensen . he just separated from his third . he is in fish . he is fish .
she is keeping his name . and one of his planes . and all seven of his children
that does not make sense . it is like punishing you for being goal oriented .
we cannot do the impossible , mr . andrews .
what i am asking is not impossible . my daughter is somewhere between here and miami . i want her found !
i have put extra men on , all along the way .
it is not enough ! are you certain she is not with king westley ?
no . he is been trailed twenty four hours a day since this thing started . he cannot even get a phone call we do not know about .
ohmary
yes , sir ?
how is she ?
whyuhshe is all right , sir .
that is the matter ? anything wrong ?
oh , no , sir . no different than
yes . i know . still in the dumps , huh ?
cannot you get them to go any faster ? this dissolves to a deserted road , peter at the wheel of his car . his high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing .
yeah , but i do not like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . just between you and methose things give me a stiff pain .
you need not see anybody . you can come directly to my study . i would appreciate it very much if
mr . warne ?
yeah .
i was surprised to get your note . my daughter had not told me anything about you . about your helping her .
that is typical of your daughter . takes those things for granted . why does she think i lugged her all the way from miami for the love of it ?
please understand me . when i say she did not tell me anything about it , i mean not until a little while ago . she thinks you are entitled to anything you can get .
oh , she does , huh ? is not that sweet of her ! you do not , i suppose .
do not know . i would have to see on what you base your claim . i presume you feel you are justified in
i sold some drawers and socks , too i am throwing those in .
and this is what you wantthirty nine dollars and sixty cents ?
why not ? i am not charging you for the time i wasted .
yes , i knowbut
that is the matter ? is not it cheap enough ? a trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars !
let me get this straight . you want this thirty nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars ?
what ten thousand ?
the reward .
who said anything about a reward !
i am afraid i am a little confused . you see , i assumed you were coming here for
all i want is thirty nine sixty . if you will give me a check i will get out of this place . it gives me the jitters .
you are a peculiar chap .
we will go into that some other time .
the average man would go after the reward . all you seem to
listen , did anybody ever make a sucker out of you ? this is a matter of principle . something you probably would not understand . when somebody takes me for a buggy ride i do not like the idea of having to pay for the privilege .
you were taken for a buggy ride ?
here you are . do you mind if i ask you something frankly ? do you love my daughter ?
a guy that would fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined .
that is an evasion .
if you had half the brains you are supposed to have , you would have done it yourselflong ago .
do you love her ?
a normal human being could not live under the same roof with her , without going nuts . she is my idea of nothing !
i asked you a question . do you love her ?
that is this about not eating ?
know what my next move is ? no more cigarettes .
why do not you put me in chains ?
i might .
come on , ellie . stop being silly . you know i am going to have my way .
i will not stand for it ! i will not stand for your running my life ! why do you insist on it !
you ought to know why . because
yes . i know . because i am your daughter and you love me . because you do not want me to make any mistakes . because
because marrying that fool king westley is
you are wasting your time . i am already married to him .
smart , are not you ! so subtle .
if gandhi had a chef like paul , it would change the whole political situation in india .
you cannot tempt me . do you hear ? i will not eat !
please . i cannot fight on an empty stomach . remember what napoleon said .
where are you taking me ?
south america .
south america !
we leave miami in an hour . soongs we get some supplies aboard .
you will have a corpse on your hands ! that what you will have . i will not eat a thing while i am on this boat .
in that event , we will not need so many supplies .
what do you expect to accomplish by all this ? i am already married !
i will get it annulled .
you will never do it ! you cannot do it !
i will do it if it takes every penny i have got . i will do it if i have to bribe that musical comedy justice of the peace ! i will do itif i have to prove that you were dragged in , staggering drunk . you probably were . mmmmmm . this filet mignon is divine !
what have you got against king westley ?
nothing much . i just think he is a fake , that is all .
you only met him once .
that was enough . do you mind handing me the ketchup ?
you talk as if he were a gigoloor something .
never mindi will get it myself . gigolo ? why , you took the word right out of my mouth . thanks .
he is one of the best fliers in the country . right now he is planning a trip to japan .
you are going to finance him , i suppose .
your whole life is devoted to just one thing . to accumulate more money . at least there s romance in what he is doing .
he is no good , ellie , and you know it . you married him only because i told you not to .
a time will come when you will thank me for this .
i will not thank you ! i will never thank you !
please do not shout .
i will shout to my heart s content ! i will scream if i want to .
ellie
oh , hello , dad .
i knocked several times .
sorry . must have been day dreaming .
well , everything s set . creating quite a furor , too . great stunt king s going to pull .
stunt ?
landing on the lawn in an autogyro .
oh , yes . i heard .
that is the matter , ellie ? that is wrong ?
nothing .
you have been acting so strangely since you returned . i ami am worried . i have not bothered to ask you any questionsi is not all this what you wanted ? you have not changed your mind about king , have you ?
oh , no .
if you have , it is not too late . you know how i feel about him . but i want to make you happy . you gave me such a scareiwhen i could not find you . you know , the old pump is not what it used to be .
i have not seen you cry since you were a baby . this must be serious . where would you meet him ?
on the road .
now , do not tell me you fell in love with a bus driver !
no .
who is he ?
i do not know very much about him . except that i love him .
well , if it is as serious as all thatwe will move heaven and earth to
it will do no good . he despises me .
oh , come now
he despises everything i stand for . he thinks i am spoiled and pampered , and selfish , and thoroughly insincere .
ridiculous !
he does not think so much of you either .
well !
he blames you for everything that is wrong about me . thinks you raised me stupidly .
fine man to fall in love with .
he is marvelous !
well , what are we going to do about it ? where is he ?
i do not know .
i would like to have a talk with him .
it is no use , dad . i practically threw myself at him .
well , under the circumstances , do not you think we ought to call this thing off ?
no , i will go through with it .
but that is silly , child . seeing how you feel , why
yes , i guess i have . i do not want to hurt anybody any more . i want to get away from all this front page publicity . it suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome . i cannot walk out on king now . it will make us all look so ridiculous . besides , what difference does it make ? i will never see peter again .
is that his name ?
peter warne !
why ? do you know him ?
oh , nono .
you have not heard from him , have you , dad ?
why , no . . . do not be silly .
looks like that was his only interest in me . the reward .
i am sorry you read it .
are you going to see him ?
i suppose so .
i will be going . ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another , as king enters .
might have been able to help if it were not for you . i have been watched so closely , i
yes . i know . well , you can help now . i issued a statement yesterday that i have withdrawn my objections . begging her to come home . i have not heard from her . apparently she does not trust me .
why should she ? after all
all right . that is why i sent for you . there s a room full of reporters out there . i want you to make a statementthat you have had a talk with methat we have reached an understandingthat if ellen comes home , i will not interfere with your marriage . will you do that ?
if you really mean it , i will .
on a hunger strike , huh ? when would she eat last ?
she has not had a thing yesterdayor today .
been sending her meals in regularly ?
yessir . she refuses them all .
why did not you jam it down her throat ?
it is not quite that simple . i have dealt with prisoners in my time , but this one
it is my daughter ! go after her .
what a hell cat . no controlling these modern girls . they are terrible !
terrible ! nothing terrible about her . she is great ! marvelous youngster ! got a mind of her own . knows just what she wants . she is not going to get it though . she will not get very far . has no money .
what about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that ?
i have not changed my mind , westley , i want you to understand that ! i do not like you ! i never have ! i never will ! that is clear enough , is not it ?
you have made that quite evidentwith all your threats of annulment . well , it has not bothered me for a minute . ellie and i got married because we love each other . and she is proving it as far as i am concerned there s going to be no annulment .
why naturally , i
naturally . you are going to become a partner in a big institution . it is one of the largest in the world .
you talk as if
ellie ? oh , she is no responsibility .
no ? say , listeni have devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat . toughest job i ever tackled . ever hear of j . p . clarkson ? biggest man in the country , is not he ? well , i tamed him . got him eating out of the palm of my hand . i have browbeaten financiers , statesmen , foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut i have never been able to do a thing with her . she is been too much for me . i am glad you think it is easy . now listenif you will do what i tell you , perhaps i might develop a little respect for you . you never can tell .
what would you like to have me do ?
try . do me a favor . try . it is your only chance . and hers , too . do that for meand maybe we will be friends maybe . do we understand each other ?
yes , sir .
you thought that up all by yourself , huh ?
why , it will make all the front pages . a spectacular thing like that
personally , i think it is stupid ! but go ahead . have a good time . as long as ellie does not object .
oh , no . she will be crazy about it . well , see you later . i am going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space . goodbye .
we have done that already .
what happened ?
here s another wire , sir . this one s from charleston . checking every northbound train . also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways . no success yet . will continue to do everything possible . signed lovington detective agency , charleston .
any others ?
yessir . there s a report here from every state along the east coast . want to hear them ?
what do they say ?
they are practically all the same , sir .
amateurs !
do not want to talk todo not want to talk to anybody . do not want to see anybody .
but it is king westley on the phone .
ooooooh . hello my would be ex son in law . i have sent you a check for a hundred thousand . yes . that is the smartest thing you ever did , westley , not to contest that annulment . that is satisfactory , is not it ? yeah . well , it ought to be . oh i am not complaining . it was dirt cheap . do not fall out of any windows .
there s another wire from peter , sir . they are in glen falls , michigan .
never mind , son . she does not want it .
we ai not ate nothing since yestidday .
what happened to your money ?
ma spent it all for the tickets . she did not know it was gonna be so much . we shouldnga come , i guess , but ma said there s a job waiting for her in new yorkand if we did not go , she might lose it .
going without food is bad business , son . why did not you ask somebody ?
me ? forget it , son . i got millions .
hey , hey , are not you afraid you will burn out a tonsil ?
tonsil ? me ? no ! me burn a tonsil ? my tonsils will not burn as life s corners i . . .
all right , let it go .
no , thanks . we are not hungry .
oh , i see , young people in love are never hungry .
no .
whadda you want !
if you will be good enough to remove those newspapers i will have a seat .
okay ! okay ! keep your shirt on , young feller .
what do you think you are doing !
huh ?
the papers ! the papers ! whadda you mean throwing em out !
that is a long story , my friend . you see , i do not like sitting on newspapers . i did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants .
hey , whadda you trying to dokid me ?
oh , i would not kid you . on the level , it actually happened . nobody bought a paper that day . they followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants .
what are you gonna do about the papers ? somebody s gotta pick em up .
it is okay with me . i am not arguing .
fresh guy , huh ! what you need is a good sock on the nose .
oh , yeah ?
now , that is a brilliant answer . why did not i think of it ? our conversation could have been over long ago .
oh , yeah ?
driver !
yeah ?
these seats accommodate two passengers , do not they ?
that storm sure made a mess outa these roads .
holy smokes ! you will never get out yourself ! better phone for some help .
i beg your pardon !
now , listen . i am in a very ugly mood . i put up a stiff battle for that seat . so if it is just the same to you scram .
tell that man not to drive so fast .
are you talking to me ?
i do not know what you are raving about , young man . and , furthermore , i am not interested .
oh , my heavens ! it is gone !
yeah . i knew you would catch on eventually .
what happened ?
that cadaverous looking yegg who sat in front of us , just up and took it . boy , how that baby can run !
what am i going to do now ?
do not tell me your ticket was in it ?
no , i have got that , all right . but my money . all i have here is four dollars . i have got to get to new york with it .
you can wire home for some money when we get to jacksonville .
why , noi yes . . . i guess i will .
i will report it to the driver . about your bag , i mean .
no . i would rather you did not .
do not be a fool . you lost your bag . the company will make good . that is your name ?
i do not want it reported !
why , that is ridiculous ! they are responsible for everything that
see here , can you understand english ! i do not want it reported ! please stay out of my affairs ! i want to be left alone . a close up of peter shows him glaring after her .
oh , thank you . we are in jacksonville , are not we ?
yes .
that was foolish of me . why did not you shove me away ?
i hated to wake you up . how about some breakfast ?
remember me ? i am the fellow you slept on last night .
that is the matter ? would not the old meanies wait for you ? say , how old are you anyway ? do not you know these busses work on a schedule ? you need a guardian .
do not tell me you did it on my account ! hope you are not getting any idea that what happened last night is you need not concern yourself about me , young man . i can take care of myself .
you are doing a pretty sloppy job of it . here s your ticket .
my ticket ?
i found it on the seat .
you will never get away with it , miss andrews .
what are you talking about ?
just a spoiled brat of a rich man . you and westley will make an ideal team .
will you please tell me what you are raving about !
you will never get away with it , miss andrews . your father will stop you before you get half way to new york .
you must have me confused with
take my advicegrab the first bus back to miami . that guy s a phony .
i did not ask for your advice .
that is right . you did not .
you are not going to notify my father , are you ?
what for ?
if you play your cards right , you might get some money out of it .
i never thought of that .
listen , if you will promise not to do it , i will pay you . i will pay you as much as he will . you will not gain anything by giving me away as long as i am willing to make it worth your while . i have got to get to new york without being stopped . it is terribly important to me . i would pay now , only the only thing i had when i jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and i had to pawn that to get these clothes . i will give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to new york .
if you promise not to snap my head off , i would like to thank you .
here , boy !
what would you do ? wire one of your friends for money ?
of course i do . what do you mean
beat it !
a dollar sixty ! . . . you had four dollars last night ! how do you expect to get to new york at the rate you are going ?
that is none of your business .
now , just a minuteyou cannot
hey , brat ! the view moves to the rear door of the bus . ellie stands on the bottom step .
are you talking to me !
darn clever , these armenians .
yeah . yeah , it is a gift .
i just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband .
oh , i forgot to tell you . i registered as mr . and mrs .
oh , you did ? what am i expected to doleap for joy ?
i kind of half expected you to thank me .
your ego is colossal .
chalk up one for your side . now listen , you want to get to king westley , do not you ? all right , i am here to help you . what i want is your story , exclusive . a day to day account . all about your mad flight to happiness . i need that story . just between you and me i have got to have it .
now is not that just too cute ? there s a brain behind that face of yours , is not there ? you have got everything nicely figured out , for yourself , including this .
this ? oh , that is a matter of simple mathematics . these cabins cost two bucks a night and i am very sorry to inform you , wifey dear , but the family purse will not stand for our having separate establishments .
well , thank you . thank you very much , but you have been very kind .
that , i suppose , makes everythinguhquite all right .
do you mind joining the israelites ?
you are not really serious about this , are you ?
i have an idiosyncrasy all my own . you will notice my coat came firstthen the tiethen the shirtnow , according to hoyle , the pants should come next . but that is where i am different . go for the shoes first . after that i
do you mind putting out the light ?
who are you ?
who , me ? why , i am the whippoorwill that cries in the night . i am the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face .
you have got a name , have not you ?
yeah . i got a name . peter warne .
peter warne ? i do not like it .
do not let it bother you . you are giving it back to me in the morning .
pleased to meet you , mr . warne . . .
here

i cannot go out like this .

like this . i have no robe .
where would you say the showersand thingswere ?
heyyou are little , are not you ?
where is the shower ?
your hair s cute like that . you should never comb it .
high time you got back .
very outspoken , too . said i looked funny . was not that cute ?
hurry up and get dressed .
why , peter ! do not you want to hear about our lovely friends ?
well , i hope you are not going to dictate whom i can talk to .
i know a couple of truck drivers i would like to have you meet sometime . come on , sit down .
thank you . my , my ! scrambled eggs .
egg . one eggdoughnutsblack coffee . that is your ration till lunch . any complaints ?
nope . no complaints .
i would have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint .
why , you do not have to apologize , mr . warne . you will never know how much i appreciate all this .
what makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning ?
must be the spring .
i thought maybeuh believe you me told you a couple of snappy stories .
he apologized for last night . said he did not know we were married .
just shows you how wrong a guy can be . doughnut ?
thanks . you think this whole business is silly , do not you ? i mean running away and everything .
no . no . it is too good a story .
yes , you do . you think i am a fool and a spoiled brat . perhaps i am , although i do not see how i can be . people who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way . i never have . on the contrary , i have always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom . would you believe it ? this is the first time i have ever been alone with a man !
yeah ?
it is a wonder i am not panic stricken .
um . you are doing all right .
thanks . nurses , governesses , chaperones , even body guards . oh , it is been a lot of fun .
one consolation you can never be lonesome .
it has its moments . it got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father s detectives . ii did it once actually went shopping without a body guard . it was swell . i felt absolutely immoral . but it did not last long . they caught up with me in a department store . i was so mad i ran out the back way and jumped into the first car i saw . guess who was in it ?
santa claus ?
kingking westley was in it .
oh . is that how you met him ?
um hm . we rode around all afternoon . father was frantic . by o clock he was having all the rivers dragged .
say , where did you learn to dunk , in finishing school ?
aw , now , do not you start telling me i should not dunk .
of course you should not . you do not know how to do it . dunking s an art . do not let it soak so long . a dip and plop , into your mouth . if you let it soak so long , it will get soft and fall off . it is all a matter of timing . i ought to write a book about it .
thanks , professor .
just goes to show you . twenty millions and you do not know how to dunk .
detectives !
that is father at work , what will i do ? peter , what will i do ?
yeah . i got a letter from aunt betty . she says if we do not stop over at wilkes barre she will never forgive us .
do not get excited , peter . they just asked a civil question .
there you go again ! how many times did i tell you to stop butting in when i have an argument ?
well , you do not have to lose your temper !
you do not have to lose your temper ! that is what you told me the last time too . every time i step in to protect you . at the elk s dance when that big swede made a pass at you
oh , so now i was drunk !
well , you were !
i am sorry i did not take another sock at him .
yeah , and gotten yourself arrested !
aw , nuts ! you are just like your old man ! once a plumber always a plumber ! there is not an ounce of brains in your whole family !
say , you were pretty good . jumping in like that . got a brain , have not you ?
you were not so bad yourself .
we could start a two person stock company . if things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums . we will call this one the great deception .
next week east lynne .
after that the three musketeers . i would make a great d artagnan .
how about cinderellaor a real hot love story ?
no mushy stuff . i am running this troupe .
oh , you are ! who made you the manager ?
i did ! it was my idea , was not it ?
you always want to run everything .
if you do not like it , you can resign from the company .
i refuse to resign !
i better go over and see her .
do not be silly . nothing you can do . must be tough on an old womana trip like this .
poor old shapeley . you should not have frightened him like that .
at the rate he started , he is probably passed two state lines by this time . the exercise is good for him .
yes , i noticed he was getting a little fat lately . ouch !
that is the matter ?
i was never built for these moonlight strolls . why did we have to leave the bus ?
first town we hit in the morning , you better wire your father .
not as long as i am alive .
okay with me , if you can stand the starvation diet .
what do you meanstarvation ?
it takes money to buy food .
why , have not you ?
not a sou . i had some before the fainting scene .
you did not give that boy all your money ?
i did not give him anything . you were the big hearted gal . how about wiring your father now ?
never ! i will get to new york if i have to starve all the way .
must be some strange power westley has over you women . how do you expect to get there ?
to new york ?
yeah .
i am following you .
are not you afraid of me ?
no .
i wish you would stop being playful .
sorry . it is the first time i have ridden piggy back in years .
this is not piggy back .
of course it is .
you are crazy .
remember distinctly father taking me for a piggy back ride
and he carried you like this , i suppose .
yes .
your father did not know beans about piggy back riding .
my unclemother s brotherhad four children . . . and i have seen them ride piggy back .
i do not think there s a piggy back rider in your whole family . i never knew a rich man yet who was a good piggy back rider .
that is silly .
to be a piggy backer it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature .
and rich people have none of those qualifications , i suppose .
not a one .
you are prejudiced .
this looks like the best spot .
we are not going to sleep out here , are we ?
peter
if you are scared it scares the hunger out of you .
not if you are more hungry than scared .
all right . you win . let s forget it .
i cannot forget it . i am still hungry .
i will get my clothes all wrinkled .
well , take them off .
what !
that is the matter ?
oh , peter
that is got into you ?
i was not gone more than a minute . just went out to find you something to eat .
knowbut
here . eat your head off .
i do not want it now .
thought you were hungry !
wasbut
but what !
was so scaredthat it scared
sure .
what ?
nothing . nothing you would give two cents for .
i am . i only work when i have to . two years ago i got a notion and went to china . there was a war going on . swell ! after a while it got stale . i went down to tahiti . just lay on the beach for six months . what could be sweeter ?
what are you thinking about ?
by a strange coincidence , i was thinking of you .
really ?
yeah . i was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy .
what would you say we are supposed to be doing ?
hitch hiking .
if it is just the same to you , we will sit right here till they come . got a toothpick ?
no . but i have got a penknife .
there it is . better swallow it . we are not going to have any breakfast .
need not rub it in . what are you eating ?
carrots .
raw ?
uh huh . want one ?
no ! ! it is a wonder you could not get me something i can eat .
you do not think i am going around panhandling for you . best thing in the world for youcarrots . had a tough time getting them . if that farmer ever caught megoodnight !
i wish you would not talk too much . we let a car get away .
what if nobody stops for us ?
oh , they will stop , all right . it is a matter of knowing how to hail them .
you are an expert , i suppose .
expert ! going to write a book on it . called the hitch hikers hail .
there s no end to your accomplishments .
you think it is simple , huh ?
oh , no !
but the thumb always works . different ways to do it , though . depends on how you feel . for instance , number one is a short , jerky movement that shows independence . you do not care if they stop or not . cause you got some money in your pocket , see ?
clever .
number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this . that means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer s daughter .
you figured that all out yourself , huh ?
oh , that is nothing . now take number three , for instance . that is a pip . it is the pathetic one . when you are brokeand hungryand everything looks black . it is a long movement like this with a follow through .
amazing .
here comes a car !
something must have gone wrong . i guess i will try number two .
i guess maybe i will not write that book after all .
yes . but look at all the fun you had . mind if i try ?
you ! do not make me laugh .
what are you going to do ?
you might give me a little credit .
what for ?
i proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb .
why did not you take all your clothes off ? you could have stopped forty cars .
what were you going to do ? gold dig him for a meal ?
why not ? i am hungry .
eat a carrot .
never ! i am going in and ask him
oh , peter ! what happened ? are you all right ?
come onget in .
oh , you have been hurt ! there s a cut on
come on ! come on !
what happened ?
just a road thief . picks people up and runs off with their stuff . what a racket !
what would you give him for the car ?
you do not have to eat the carrots . just passed a pond with some ducks in it .
any luck ?
yeah . he finally agreed to let us have a room .
what about money ?
talked him out of it . he thinks we are going to stay a week . i will have to think of something before morning .
that is swell !
i am glad you think so . if you ask me , it is foolish . i told you there s no sense in our staying here tonight . we could make new york in less than three hours .
i could not arrive in new york at three in the morning . everybody s in bed .
yes . you will have a great story , will not you ?
thank you . am i going to see you in new york ?
nope .
have not you ever wanted to fall in love ?
me ?
yes . have not you thought about it at all ? seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy .
better go back to your bed .
i love you .
you are forgetting you are married .
i hope you got your money .
you bet i did .
congratulations .
same to you .
why do not you stay and watch the fun ? you will enjoy it immensely .
compared to you , my friend , shapeley s an amateur . whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this ! you are positively the most conceited
hey , wait a minute ! let s get something straightened out right now . if you have any peculiar ideas that i am interested in you , forget it . you are just a headline to me .
i will bet you are in an awful hurry to get back to new york , are not you ?
onetwothreefourfive
why , you bully . i believe you would .
sixseveneightnine
maybe i could jump out of the window . do you think they would see me ?
there s a man here to see you , sweetheart .
no , it is not . i am hungry andand scared .
you cannot be hungry and scared at the same time .
comical part of it is , it is not what you want at all . in a couple of weeks you will be looking for the nearest exit . . . people like you spend all your life on a merry go round . i guess that is what makes you so dizzy . you are always chasing after something . at least you think you are . truth is , you are just running away . from yourself , mostly . cause you are miserable . you hate yourself . the world s full of people like you . do not know what they want .
i just want to be let alone , that is all . life s swell if you do not try too hard . most people want to get a strangle hold on it . they are not living . they are just feverish . if they did not get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values , they would find what they want . peace and calm . when you get right down to it , that is all the shooting for , will you tell me ? after all , you can only eat three meals a day , only sleep in one bed right now , that hay feels pretty good to you , does not it ? sure it does . cause you were tiredand it is the only thing around .
is that the walls of jericho going up ?
no harm in your coming to see us .
not interested .
how are you , ellie ? are you happy ?
happy ? why should not i be happy ? i am getting the handsomest man in captivity . here you are , king . let s drink . let s drink to us . we finally made it , did not we ?
you bet we did .
it is up to you now . i want our life to be full of excitement , king . we will never let up , will we ? never a dull moment . we will get on a merry go round and never get off . promise you will never let me get off ? it is the only way to live , is not it ? no time to think . we do not want to stop to think , do we ? just want to keep going .
whatever you say , darling .
where is the bus to new york ?
left twenty minutes ago .
why , that is ridiculous ! i was on that busi told them to wait !

but cannot you wait until morning
can i use your telephone ? i want to talk to new york .
you made no mistake sitting next to me . just between us , the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ai not nothing to write home to the wife about . you gotta be awful careful who you hit up with , is what i always say , and you cannot be too particular , neither . once when i was coming through north carolina , i got to gabbing with a good looking mama . one of those young ones , you know , and plenty classy , too . kinda struck my fancy . you know how it is . well , sir , you could a knocked me over with a mack truck . i was just warming up when she is yanked offa the bus . who do you think she was ? huh ? might as well give up . the girl bandit ! the one the papers been writing about . yessir , you coulda knocked me over with a mack truck . that is the matter , sister ? you ai not saying much .
seems to me you are doing excellently without any assistance .
but i do not go in for that kinda stuffmuch . i like to pick my fillies . take you , for instance . you are my type . no kidding sister . i could go for you in a big way . fun on the side shapeley they call me , and the accent is on the fun , believe you me .
hey , that is this ? wearing papa s things ? now that is cute . that is what i call real lovey dovey . yessir .
if you do not get out of here , i will slap that fresh mouth of yours .

boss , oswald impersonators ? sounds like james bond now .
if this is oswald , it must be our third oswald .
susie , watch the language , would you please .
i do not care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo , numa , it is none of our business . let s keep this side of it quiet , shall we ?
when you are in a war , boss , you use every weapon you got .
the u . s . attorney in washington declines to serve our subpoena on allen dulles , charles cabell , cia director richard helms , or any fbi agent we named .
well , what do you expect from a pig but a grunt .
william walter , the night clerk on duty here in the fbi office , gave me a copy of this . it went all over the country . nothing was done , and the motorcade went ahead on schedule and this was not even mentioned in the warren report ! read it , al .
gentlemen , i will not hear this . i value bill as much as anyone here . we all need to make room for someone else s ideas , lou , especially me . maybe oswald is what everyone says he is and i am just plain dumb wrong .
why you keep dancing on my head for , my man ? we been thicker n molasses pie since law school .
because you keep conning me , dean . i read your testimony to the warren commission and . . .
there you go . grain of salt . two sides to every coin .
you tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this clay bertrand and asked to fly to dallas and be lee oswald s layer .
right .
now that is pretty important , dean . you also told the fbi when you met him , he was six foot two . then you tell the commission he was five foot eight . how the hell did the man shrink like that , dean ?
yeah , she was pretty , all right , but not half as cute as you , deano . you shoulda tried a legitimate line of business .
you cannot ever say crime do not pay in louisiana , jim only not as good as it used to . good chowder , ai not it ?
when did you first do business with this bertrand ?
oh , i first heard these street cats jiving about him back in , when i lived down in the quarter .
street cats ?
what was his voice like ?
you knew you were not talking to some low life fag , you know . he had command of the king s english .
did he pay ?
always like tits on a pig . i wish i had a million of those bimbettes .
and oswald ?
like i told to the washington boys , bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his marine discharge . . .
so you saw oswald how many times ?
recall any names ?
mario , jose they wear names like you and i wear clothes . today the name is candy , tomorrow it is butsie . i wish i could help you , jim .
did you speak to oswald in dallas ?
hell , no ! i told this bertrand cat right off , this is not my scene , man . i deal with muni court , i am a hack in nigger town , that kid needs a hot dog .
then how the hell did you get in the warren commission , dean ? except through the phone records in the dallas jail ?
there were no phone records .
of course there were not . cause they disappeared . and yet the commission found you , dean .
all this blubbering over that sonofabitch ! they are grieving like they knew the man . it makes me want to puke .
god s sake , chief . the president was shot .
a bullshit president ! i do not see any weeping for all the thousands of cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the bay of pigs . where are all the tears for the russians and hungarians and chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by kennedy s communist buddies all these damned peace treaties ! i am telling ya jack , that is what happens when you let the niggers vote . they get together with the jews and the catholics and elect an irish bleeding heart .
chief , maybe you had a little too much to drink .
well , the kid musta gone nuts , right ? i said oswald must have flipped . just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him , right ?
i think i will cut out here , chief . i gotta get home .
who would ever thought that goofy oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination ? just goes to show , you can never know about some people . am i right , jack ? well , bless my soul . your eyes are as red as two cherries , jack . do not tell me we have another bleeding heart here . hell , all these years i thought you were on my side .
chief , sometimes i do not know whether you are kidding or not .
who the hell opened my files ! you have been looking through my private files , have not you , you weasel ?
you may not like this , chief , but you are beginning to act paranoid . i mean , you really are .
you found out about dave ferrie going to texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on . you are a goddamn spy .
goddammit chief , why would i ever need to look in your files ? i saw enough here this summer to write a book .
i always lock my files . and you were the only one here today . . . what do you mean , you son of a bitch ?
maybe there s more to this , susie . the cia s keeping something from our enemies .
i do not know if it is coincidence , but oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the u program from his days at atsugi air base in japan . six months after he arrives in russia , francis gary powers u spy flight goes down in russia . that plane was untouchable . powers hinted that oswald could have given the russians enough data to hit it . as a direct result , the peace summit between khrushchev and eisenhower failed . i cannot help thinking of that book seven days in may , maybe someone in our military did not want the peace conference to happen , maybe oswald was part of that . it gets weirder .
susie , you are an assistant d . a . , remember . stick to what you can prove in court .
who ?
grab your socks and pull . . . clay bertrand is clay shaw . . .
or a cover up ! jesus , bill , do not you have enough proof of the fbi s complicity now ?
bill .
hey , where y at , frank ? you are wasting your time here . big jim gave strict orders . no fbi allowed .
it is you i want to talk to , bill .
boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew . . .
your boss got a serious problem , bill . real serious . we know that is been going on at your office
yeah , i guess you do .
you have got nothing , bill . i am talking as a friend now . you are riding on the titanic . time to jump off before you get destroyed along with garrison .
frank , i do not want to hear it .
who do you think fed him that information ? garrisongs going down . we are talking your career here , bill , your life . you are a young guy . . . we know you are working that castro thing .
no , i am not . . .
correct me if i am wrong . i thought we were on the same side . what the hell business is it of theirs to say that ?
what do you think , lou ?
i am just an investigator , bill . i leave the theories to you lawyers .
it is addressed to no one and no signature . to leave this life is , for me , a sweet prospect . i find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand , everything that is loathsome .
the fact is he is gone , chief , and so s our case .
not unless we go for shaw now .
yeah . they were seen together in clinton in early september . the civil rights movement was running a voter registration drive .
. . . rumor is shaw , a local boy , was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement . no one really knows what they were doing there , but everyone sure saw em . they stood out like cottonballs . i got whites and blacks saw em , but last time i checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote . we still got the negro junkie , vernon bundy , saw em talking at the seawall near lake pontchartrain . but it is tough , boss no one wants to talk about shaw . he is . . .
you know you keep saying that .
keep saying what ?
clay bertrand ? sure i know him . he comes around the quarter .
who is he , joe ? i have been to every bar , no one wants to talk .
i told your uncle i never met a lawman who was not a punk . you too , bill , even if you are family . he is a big shot businessman . i seen him on the tv news a lot with all the other big shots . a fag , you know . goes by another name down here .
that is the other name ?
shaw . clay shaw .
clay bertrand is clay shaw ? the guy who used to run the international trade mart ?
yeah , that is the big mystery ? everybody down here knows the guy .
so why does he call himself bertrand ?
clay bertrand , willie ?
did he pay you for this ?
. . . there were about nine or ten people , cubans , friends of dave doing some stuff in the bush with him . place was a mess . dave s mind was a mess , y know he had all those mice cages around cause he is working on this cure for cancer . . . dave s smart real smart speaks five languages , knows philosophy , medicine , military history , politics . he wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him cause he was queer . . .
and that is where you met oswald for the first time ?
fuck , yes . hell , i am already in jail . i got no reason to lie to you . i ai not no nigger .
go on , willie .
hold your horses . what kinda source ?
morning , boys . ready for a walking tour ?
at sunday morning ? it is not exactly fresh blood we are sniffing here , boss .
what the hell s a communist like lee oswald doing working out of banister s ?
lord , wake me , please . i must be dreaming .
well , it is a terrific yard , chief , but the mangs an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss .
does that bother you , bill ? i always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute , she has to have bad eyesight .
he will never sign a statement , boss , let alone get on a witness stand .
when something s rotten in the land , bill , it generally is not just one fish , we will get corroboration . . . find this clay bertrand . if i were a betting man , i would give you to it is an alias . start checking around the quarter .
and the six of us , with almost no budget and in secret , are going to solve the case that the warren commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars could not solve . we cannot keep up with the crimes in the parish as it is , chief .
the murder of a president , bill , is a crime in orleans parish too . i did not pick you because of your legal skill , you know .
i am lost , boss . what are we saying here ?
we are saying that when oswald went to russia , he was not a real defector , that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died , that is what we are saying .
and therefore because oswald pulled the trigger , the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief . that is what you are saying !
i will go you one better ! maybe oswald did not even pull the trigger , bill . the nitrate test indicates he did not even fire a rifle on november nd . and on top of that , they did not even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day .
he had his palm print on the weapon .
but why ?
i still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this , boss . susie s stuff is colorful , but . . .
can you get some sworn statements ?
that is gonna be tough . nobody s talking .
that is fine , numa , but what about all the people who are not writing letters . they are sitting home reading all these lies . i just heard nbc crew s in town to do a white paper not on the kennedy killing , but on us . one of their top guys , harry stoner , is talking to everybody he can find about you , boss . . .
those bastards ! that is proof enough right there of what we are up against . the whole goddamn federal government , bill !
found another note , same thing , no name , no signature . when you receive this , i will be quite dead , so no answer will be possible . i offered you love . all i got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth .
all right , all right . break it up .
where you going , boss ?
i do not buy it , chief why would the fbi cover it up ? you are talking the whole fbi here . a telex that disappears from every single fbi office in the country ?
shaw s our toehold , bill . i do not know exactly what he is , where he fits , and i do not care . i do know he is lying through his teeth and i am not gonna let go of him !
so for those reasons , you are going to trial against clay shaw , chief ? well , you are gonna lose ! we should be investigating all our mafia leads here in new orleans carlos marcello , santos trafficante i can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the government . ruby s all mob , knows oswald , sets him up . hoffa trafficante marcello , they hire some guns and they do kennedy and maybe the government does not want to open up a whole can o worms there because it used the mob to get to castro . y know , castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to john q . citizen . so they close the book on j . f . k . it makes sense to me .
i do not doubt their involvement , bill , but at a low level . could the mob change the parade route , bill , or eliminate the protection for the president ? could the mob send oswald to russia and get him back ? could the mob get the fbi , the cia , and the dallas police to make a mess of the investigation ? could the mob appoint the warren commission to cover it up ? could the mob wreck the autopsy ? could the mob influence the national media to go to sleep ? and since when has the mob used anything but . s for hits , up close ? the mob would not have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude . assassins need payrolls , orders , times , schedules . this was a military style ambush from start to finish . . . a coup d etat with lyndon johnson waiting in the wings .
i know this , bill lyndon johnson got billion for his texas friends , brown and root , to dredge cam ranh bay for the military in vietnam . that is just for openers .
boss , are you calling the president a murderer ?
if i am so far from the truth , why is the fbi bugging our offices ? why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered ? why are federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before ?
with a full blown conspiracy to cover it up ? y ever read your shakespeare , bill ?
yeah .
julius caesar brutus and cassius , they too are honorable men . who killed caesar ? twenty , twenty five senators . all it takes is one judas , bill a few people , on the inside , pentagon , cia . . .
that is it look like , nick ?
nick , what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of proloid ?
he would die pretty quick , either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain .
can you ascertain if there s proloid in his system ?
not in a routine autopsy , but if we looked at the spinal fluid , there might be a high level of iodine , but it is difficult to know . whatcha thinking , jim ?
well , it does not make sense , nick he was afraid of dying , then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace , but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes .
mr . goldberg , you claim you met david ferrie and clay shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in new york , you had drinks and , under the influence discussed killing kennedy , is that not so ?
i did .
why ?
well , i wanted to make sure she is the same girl i sent .
i see . . . and why are you experiencing this paranoia ?
. . . oswald ?
no , i did not .
. . . ever called dean andrews ?
no , i did not .
. . . and have you ever met david ferrie ?
no , i would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures i have been shown .
. . . did you ever use the alias clay bertrand ?
no , i did not .
you know damn well who it is .
dave ?
yeah , you got it . since you are the only straight shooter in that fucking office , i would like an answer from you . did you plant it ?
somebody planted that fucking story ! and somebody tipped off the press i am one of garrisongs fucking suspects . i cannot go home . i am out on the street . the maggots are everywhere ! do you know what you have done to me ? it is all over the national news now . you know what you have done to me ?
calm down , dave , what ?
i am a dead man ! from here on , believe me , i am a dead man .
what are you talking about , dave ? you were not mentioned in the story . do not jump to conclusions .
you think your investigationgs been all that secret ? you know , when you talk to people , they talk to other people .
what did they . . .
you still questioning any cubans ?
dave , you know that is where this road leads .
it leads farther than that .
dave , just calm down . meet me in the lobby of the fontainbleau in minutes . i will have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name .
the fontainbleau ? minutes ?
yeah . come on , dave , come on our side . i guarantee you the boss will protect you . . . dave ?
. . . give me protection ?
yeah ! he would kill for you dave . he likes you . your mind .
i am caught in the middle . they are after me . it is almost over .
listen , dave , why do not we order some room service , have a bite , relax . i will stay as long as you want .
dave , i always play square . no bugs . i would love you to go on the record , but i m in no hurry . whenever you are ready .
i do not have much time . they do not even need bugs anymore . they got these fucking satellite waves . they put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born , right up his nostrils , subcutaneous , between his eyes . he was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment . a nazi rocket scientist father and a commie spy mother . you would never believe half the shit the agency does . i am so fucking tired . have not slept since that shit article came out . why would you guys have to go and get me involved with this ?
did we involve you , dave , or did clay shaw ?
that cocksucking faggot ! he is got me by the balls .
what do you mean ?
what about the mob , dave ? how do they figure in this ?
come in , dave . have a seat , make yourself comfortable . coffee ?
do you remember me , mr . garrison ? i met you on carondolet street right after your election . i congratulated you , remember ?
do you mind if i smoke , mr . garrison ?
how could i ? dave , as you know , president kennedy was assassinated on friday . a man named lee harvey oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named jack ruby . we have heard reports that oswald spent the summer in new orleans and we have been advised you knew oswald pretty well .
that is not true . i never met anybody named oswald . anybody who told you that has to be crazy .
but you are aware , he served in your civil air patrol unit when he was a teenager .
no . . . if he did , i do not remember him . there were lots of kids in and out . . . y know .
i am sure you have seen this . perhaps you knew this man under another name ?
no , i never saw him before in my life .
well that must have been mistaken information we got . thanks for straightening it out for us . there is one other matter that is come up , dave . we were told you took a trip to texas shortly after the assassination of friday .
yeah , now that is true . i drove to houston .
what was so appealing about houston ?
i had not been there ice skating in many years , and i had a couple of young friends with me , and we decided we wanted to go ice skating .
dave , may i ask why the urge to go ice skating in texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory ?
oh , it was just a spur of the moment thing . . . the storm was not that bad .
i see . and where did you drive ?
we went straight to houston , and then saturday night we drove to galveston and stayed over there .
why galveston ?
no particular reason . just to go somewhere .
and then sunday ?
in the morning we went goose hunting . then headed home , but i dropped the boys off to see some relatives and i stayed in hammond .
did you bag any geese on this trip ?
i believe the boys got a couple .
but the boys told us they did not get any .
oh yes , well , come to think of it , they are right . we got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them . but you could not approach them . they were a wise bunch of birds .
your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car . dave , is not it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun ?
yes , now i remember , mr . garrison . i am sorry , i got confused . we got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we would forgotten our shotguns . stupid , right ? so of course we did not get any geese .
i see . dave thank you for your time . i am sorry it has to end inconveniently for you , but i am going to have you detained for further questioning by the fbi .
why ? that is wrong ?
leongs in a bad mood , do not get excited , he is all right .
you mean about the cubans getting trained north of the lake ?
oh , you got that ? banister s pet project . getting paid by the government to work against the government . beautiful . what a mind he had , what a guy , guy . he had all those files .
who was paying you , dave ?
you think i was a getaway pilot for the assassination , do not you ?
i do not know . were you ? who you scared of , dave ?
let me get this straight , now . clay shaw is blackmailing you ?
was it the same oswald , dave , that was in dallas , or was it an impersonator .
did you take a good look at the tv when they had oswald ?
black , black just give it to me . shit . i am so exhausted . my neck is killing me . i have got cancer . had it for years . i been working with mice , y know , trying to come up with a cure .
dave , can i just ask you this directly ? did you ever work for the cia ?
you make it sound like some remote fucking experience in ancient history . man , you never leave the agency . once they got you , you are in for life .
and shaw ?
shaw s an untouchable , man highest clearance . shaw , oswald , the cubans all agency .
what about ruby ?
then who killed the president ?
shit ! forgot to glue this fucking rug today . you know , at one time i even had a full head of hair like everyone else . and then i lost that . that fucking clay shaw . i hate the bastard . all i got left is in his rotten , bloody hands . he tipped the newspapers i know it . that is how the agency works . they use people , chew them up , spit em out . now it is my turn .
they will get to you , too they will destroy you . . . they are untouchable , man . . . i am so fucking exhausted i cannot see straight .
get some rest , dave , and you will feel better in the morning . we will talk then .
colonel finck , are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck ?
i was told that the family wanted examination of the head .
as a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death , was it not ?
i had the cause of death .
your honor , i would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question . why did colonel finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck ?
i do not remember his name . you must understand it was quite crowded , and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the president who is dead , you do not look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are .
but you were a qualified pathologist . was this army general a qualified pathologist ?
no .
but you took his orders . he was directing the autopsy .
no , because there were others . there were admirals .
there were admirals .
i am going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom .
jesus , ed , from time immemorial it is been standard booking procedure to ask an alias . you know that . there s no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions .
i call em as i see em , jim . i am ruling it inadmissible .
that is our case !
if that is your case , you did not have a case . i would not believe whatever habighorst said , anyway .
i cannot believe you are saying this in the courtroom .
daddy said it was all right if i was real quiet .
dad , look what i drew .
that is something , jasper . what is it ?
daddy ! where have you been ?
are we going away , daddy ?
well , it looks like it , jasper .
because of kennedy ? are the same people gonna kill us , daddy ?
i am scared .
he asked me why i thought i was in danger and i said
well if they can kill the president , they can certainly get me .
that does not make sense , mrs . hill . we have the man that killed the president .
no , you do not !
he kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots . he was getting hot under the collar , and telling the woman not to write when he wanted .
look , do you want the truth , or just what you want me to say ?
i want the truth .
the truth is that i heard between four and six shots . i am not going to lie for you .
. . . you heard echoes .
no . i had guns all my life . i used to go turtle shooting .
i realize you are under a great deal of stress . . it is clouded your judgement .
so off the record , he starts talking about my family , and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like i did not know it or something . he got angrier and angrier and then
look , we can put you in a mental institution . we can make you look crazier n marguerite oswald , and everybody knows how crazy she is .
these new people never identified themselves . they musta been watching the whole thing cause they knew everything mary and me had been doing that day . i guess i was not too hard to find wearing that red raincoat .
how many shots you say you heard ?
four to six .
that is impossible . you heard echoes . . . echoes . we have three bullets and three shots which came from the book depository and that is all we are willing to say .
. . . which is strange cause this is less than minutes after the assassination .
no , i saw a guy shooting from over there . he was behind that fence . what are you going to do about it ?
we have that taken care of . you only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this . no one , you hear ?
if we go to him our investigation will hit the front pages by sunrise . blow up right in our face . ruby was just given a new trial . if he has something to say , it will be there . susie , what did you find out on oswald ?
finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has he is given , rubles , a roomy apartment with a balcony , has affairs with local girls .
makes sense he is a spokesman .
do not get sidetracked ! how does he get back to the states ? that is the point . does he have any problems ?
none ! the state department issues him a new passport in hours and loans him the money to travel . he is never investigated or charged by the navy for revealing classified information or , as far as we know , debriefed by the cia .
this is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the pacific ! he should have been prosecuted as a traitor !
the fbi finally gets around to talking to him in dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant communist type .
spas t . raikin , a leading member of an anti communist group .
and marina ? does she have a problem getting out ?
none either . it is bizarre . it is next to impossible to get russian sweethearts out . nor does lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to cuba and russia in . a man who has defected once already . it is crazy .
the next thing we know he is living in dallas ft . worth in october working months at jaggars chiles stovall , a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the u . s . army . . . he starts work only days before the government reveals russian missiles in cuba and the crisis explodes . oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the u planes and works alongside a young man who would been in the army security agency .
sort of like benedict arnold coming back to george washingtongs cabinet .
the oswalds are introduced by george de mohrenschildt to janet and bill williams . it is through janet williams in october that lee gets the warehouse job , right smack on elm street at the book depository , which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence .
all i can find out about the williams is their tax returns are classified and that bill williams , a descendant of the cabots of massachusetts , has links through his family and united fruit to the cia and does classified work for bell helicopter which requires a security clearance so what is oswald , a defector , doing visiting his wife in his house ? williams has a relationship at bell with general walter dornberger , another one of the nazis we brought in after the war for our missile program . he used slave labor to build the v rockets for hitler before bell needed him .
. . . now it gets positively spooky . in january , in new orleans , at the bolton ford dealership when the oswald we know is in russia there is a man using the name oswald to buy trucks for the friends of democratic cuba . the salesman never saw him again , but guess who s on the articles of incorporation of the friends of democratic cuba ? guy banister . banister has someone using the name oswald to buy the trucks . hoover , at the fbi , writes a memo dated june , , that there could be someone using oswald s passport and identity .
i do not believe it !
i think clinton is a breakthrough . shaw denies he knows ferrie or oswald . is that right ? it proves he is a liar . keep on it , bill .
are not you being a little hard ?
i am sorry .
i am not sure i understand .
well . . . in an investigation we are conducting your name has come up a number of times .
i would not imagine where .
we recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you . are you acquainted with a david logan ?
no . never heard of him .
a perry russo ?
no .
a willie o keefe ?
no , i do not believe i know anyone by that name .
perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory . mr . o keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter a colored man . he particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other which he found rather unusual because the table was so long . does that bring back memories of willie o keefe ?
not at all . but on the other hand , i do have a lovely chippendale dining table and i often have a friend over sitting at one end while i sit at the other . that is precisely the point of a long dining table . the splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it .
i would imagine a uniformed waiter helps .
after dinner you paid him to have sex with you .
pffft ! absolute nonsense . the quarter is filled with vivid imaginations , my dear mr . garrison grimy young hoodlums who will say and do anything . as you well know .
who ?
david ferrie .
no . i have never known anyone by that name . of course never having met mr . o keefe i could hardly have met mr . ferrie . . .
let me show you his picture .
no . i am sure i have never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance .
does the name clay bertrand mean anything to you ?
clay bertrand ? clay bertrand ? i believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the chamber of commerce . is that the man you had in mind ?
no , it was not . do you know an attorney by the name of dean andrews ?
mr . shaw , can you identify this man ?
naturally . are you claiming , mr . garrison , that mr . oswald also had dinner with me ?
mr . shaw , did you ever meet lee harvey oswald ?
you really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters , do not you , mr . garrison .
please answer the question .
mr . shaw , this is an italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the board of centro mondo commerciale in italy , that this company was a creature of the cia for the transfer of funds in italy for illegal political espionage activities . it says that this company was expelled from italy for those activities .
i am well aware of this asinine article . and i am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper .
it says that this company has heavily fascist ties to the french secret army organization that tried to assassinate de gaulle in .
nonsense . what next ?
. . . and that this company is linked to the schlumber tool company here in houma , louisiana which is where their arms may have come from to david ferrie and his cubans . . .
mr . garrison , you are reaching . i am an international businessman . the trade mart which i founded is america s commercial pipeline to latin america . i trade everywhere . i am accused , as are all businessmen , of all things . i somehow go about my business , make money , help society the best i can and try to promote free trade in this world .
and if i was , mr . garrison . . . do you think i would be here today . . . talking to somebody like you ?
no , people like you do not have to , i guess people like you walk between the raindrops .
may i go ? regardless of what you may think of me , mr . garrison , i am a patriot first and foremost .
i have spent half my life in the united states military serving and defending this great country , mr . shaw , and you are the first person i ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president .
in the sheriff s report , mrs . mercer , it says you were at dealey plaza two hours before the assassination but that . . .
you mean you identified him on saturday , the day before ruby shot oswald ?
that is right . when i saw him on tv , i was shocked . i said to my family , that was the man i saw in the truck .
but you did not seem nearly so sure in your statement to the warren commission .
this says mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green ford pickup truck . that is not true . i recognized him and i told them so . . . they also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck , which it was not . and here . . . . . . on the dallas sheriff s report . this is really strange . see that notarized signature on the bottom of each page ? that is not my signature . and there never was any notary present during any of my questioning . i guess that is all . . .
mrs . mercer , as a former fbi man , it is difficult to accept this .
jim , dinner s just about ready . . . i have got a surprise for you . . . tried something new . . . jim ? jim , dinner .
mmmmm . . . sure smells good . . . but egghead , do you realize oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination , with no lawyer present , and nobody recorded a word of it ? i cannot believe it . a police captain with years experience and a crowd of federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that oswald said would be inadmissible in court .
i cannot believe a man as intelligent as earl warren ever read that is in those volumes .
one hour , y hear ? some saturday night date you are . mama warned me this would happen if i married such a serious man .
honey , you all right ?
it is incredible , honey the whole thing . a lieutenant colonel testifies that lee oswald was given a russian language exam as part of his marine training only a few months before he defects to the soviet union . a russian exam !
i cannot believe this . it is four thirty , jim garrison . i have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and . . .
honey , in all my years in the service i never knew a single man who was given a russian test . oswald was a radar operator . he would have about as much use for russian as a cat has for pajamas .
these books are getting to your mind , mr . garrison . i wish you would stop reading them .
and then this colonel tries to make it sound like nothing . oswald did badly on the test , he says . he only had two more russian words right than wrong . ha ! that is like me saying touchdown here . . . . . . is not very intelligent because i beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess .
jim , what is going on , for heavengs sake ! you going to stay up all night every night ? for what ? so you will be the only man in america who read the entire volumes of the warren report ?
liz , do i have to spell it out for you ? lee oswald was no ordinary soldier . that was no accident he was in russia . he was probably in military intelligence . that is why he was trained in russian .
honey , go back to sleep , please !
do you have any evidence against him , jim ? clay shaw s done so much for the city with all that restoration in the quarter . he is well connected , all his friends , the money , people , be careful , jim .
jim , come on , honey , get down on your hands and knees and hunt for jasper s easter egg .
no . i told you i was going to talk to shaw .
but why in the lord s name would you do it in the middle of easter sunday when you knew we were . . .
because when i scheduled it i did not realize it was a holiday . you were there , why did not you say something ?
look at the calendar , for christ s sake . you said a sunday , not easter sunday .
i am sorry , but it is important . clay shaw is important . i am sorry .
you are missing most of your life , jim , and you do not even know it . the kids are missing out too . it is not just you making the sacrifice here , honey .
hi .
tough day .
my sympathies .
liz , i am really sorry . the meeting went much longer than expected .
we waited for you . . . hours , jim . you could have telephoned , for god s sake . it is easter ! you promised , jim .
i do not know what to say except i am sorry . i just do not have rabbits on my mind .
i think you care more about john kennedy than your family ! all day long the kids are asking , where is daddy ? what am i supposed to tell your kids , jim !
i do not know what to tell them . how about the truth i am doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice will not be an arcane , vanished idea they read about in history books , like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of atlantis .
that sounds dandy , but it does not replace a father and a husband on easter day .
did they live ?
it is not funny , jim , i am scared .
nothing is going to happen to you . i will not let it .
did you enter virginia into a beauty contest ?
what ?
honey , some crackpot . martin luther king was killed in memphis today !
your daughter s life was just threatened !
just a crank making phone calls . happens a dozen times a day at the office .
our home , jim ! a kidnapper , a murderer , who knows !
only cowards make crank calls , sweetheart , nothing is going to happen .
how do you know ? how do you even know what goes on in this house anymore ! you are too busy making speeches , stirring up every crazed klansman in louisiana after us !
get a hold of yourself .
honey , come on . the government wants you to be scared . they want everybody to be scared to speak out . they count on it . but there s nothing to be scared of .
i will take them up to my mother s if it will make you feel better . spend a week . i will change the locks , the phone lines , i will even get a bodyguard , all right ? elizabeth , get a hold of yourself .
jim , before this kennedy thing , nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children . the other night jasper tried to show you a drawing . you did not even notice he was there . he came to me bawling his little eyes out . jim , he is sensitive he needs more from you .
i promise i will make more time for jasper .
is it such a chore ? i do not understand you .
damn it , if i say i will spend more time with him , i will spend more time with him . i cannot fight you and the world too , liz .
i am not fighting you , jim , i am just trying to reach you . you have changed .
of course , i have changed ! my eyes have opened , and once they are open , believe me , what used to look normal seems insane ! and now king . do not you think this has something to do with that ? cannot you see ?
i do not want to see , goddammit ! i am tired . i have had enough ! they say you do not have anything anyway ! everybody in towngs talking . you are ruining this man shaw s life ! you are attacking him because he is homosexual ! going ahead with this stupid trial ! did you ever once stop and consider what he is going through ?
that is not why i am attacking him ! you do not believe me all this time you never believed me .
well so do i , goddammit ! so do i ! i had a life too , y know i had a life , too . but you just cannot bury your head in the sand like some ostrich , goddammit , elizabeth ! it is not just about you and your well being and your two cars and your kitchen and your tv and i am jes fine honey . while our kids grow up into a shithole of lies ! well , i am not fine about that , i am angry . my life is fucked , liz ! and yours is , too ! and if you do not want to support me i can understand that but do not you go start making threats of taking the children away .
and if you are wrong ?
i never doubted for a second that i was . will you come to the trial , elizabeth ?
they killed him , honey .
huh ?
he won . . . and they killed robert kennedy . they shot him down .
i want to thank you , mr . o keefe , for this time .
for sexual purposes ?
anything else unusual about him you would be able to describe in a court of law , willie ?
willie , are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal ? under the supervision of a doctor ?
fuck , yeah ! i told you so . and you can tell em all i told you so .
you realize the things you are saying , willie , are going to be attacked by a lot of different people .
bring on all the motherfuckers ! bring their college degrees in here ! i got nuthing to hide . they cannot buy me . you cannot buy me . i do not even need the parole . this is about the truth coming out . you are a goddamn liberal , mr . garrison , you do not know shit , cause you never been fucked in the ass . fascism is here now , facism is . . .
no one s trying to buy you , willie . it is important to know why you are telling us this .
that is wrong , lou ?
oh no ! . . . how bad ?
one little guy with a cheap rifle look what he can do .
i know david a strange character .
remember whose office this was back in ? lafayette street .
i would say he was probably getting intelligence training .
lou , you were in the marines . who would be running that training ?
the office of naval intelligence .
post office .
upstairs . in that was the office of naval intelligence and just by coincidence , banister , before he was fbi , was oni . what do they say ?
bill , lou , we are standing in the heart of the united states government s intelligence community in new orleans . that is the fbi there , the cia , secret service , oni . does not this seem to you a rather strange place for a communist to spend his spare time ?
what are you driving at , boss ?
they took em to the sheriff s office , not the police station , and they let em go . no record of them ever being questioned .
i cannot say that comes as a surprise anymore .
. . . take a good look , chief , do any of em look like the hoboes you remember ?
hoboes i knew of old used to sleep in their clothes these two look pretty young .
graveyard dead . august this year . a single car accident on an empty road in midlothian , texas . the doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died .
we need to find more witnesses , lou .
can we find her ?
i never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in texas , give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced .
mobbed up all the way . tight with the dallas cops . i am digging , chief . i just need more men and some more dollars .
goddamn sam !
you do not get it , guys he cannot go down any further . we got to protect him full time .
i have a plane to catch . . . going to washington . an interesting lead , says he is closely connected to these events , but he will not come down here . . . i know what you are going through with ferrie , lou . we will talk tomorrow .
i took it once for a low thyroid condition . . . it raises the metabolism , lou . did david ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism ?
time ?
between six and seven seconds .
the key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other , and it takes a minimum . seconds to recycle this thing . the other problem is there was a tree right there . . . blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the zapruder film .
did not hoover say something about that ? the leaves had fallen off in november ?
it was a texas live oak , boss . it sheds it is leaves the first week of march . you try to hit a moving target at yards through heavy foliage with this cheap dollar sucker , the world s worst shoulder weapon . no way . the fbi tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match oswald s performance . not one . and oswald was at best a medium shot . the scope was defective on it , too . i mean this is the whole essence of the case to me . the guy could not do the shooting . nobody could . and they sold this lemon to the american public .
the zapruder film is the proof they did not count on , lou . we gotta get our hands on it .
that means we gotta subpoena time life on it .
when kennedy gets to the kill zone , it is a turkey shoot .
how many men ?
who do you think changed the parade route ?
beats me . city officials . secret service . dallas police . they did a dry run with chief curry a few days before . but they did not bother running through dealey . they stopped right there , said something like , and afterwards there s only the freeway , and went home .
you know who the mayor was ?
no .
earle cabell . and guess who his brother is ?
who ?
general charles cabell . deputy director of the cia . fired by kennedy in because of the bay of pigs fiasco , he moved back to the pentagon , called kennedy a traitor . when he came to new orleans to address the foreign policy association , you know who introduced him ? our friend clay shaw .
the warren commission call him ?
his boss was the one on the warren commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community .
allen dulles ?
head of the cia since . kennedy fired them both . cabell was his deputy for nine years . talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop . now we will have to subpoena them , lou .
maybe we should just call it a day , lou . go home . while we are still a little behind . we got two people killed , maybe more we never thought about .
chief , i have had my doubts about bill for a long time . he is fighting everything .
i just plain do not trust him anymore .
maybe you did not hear what i said . i will not tolerate this infighting among the staff , i warn you that . . .
are you giving me an ultimatum , lou ?
well , if that is what you want to call it . i did not ever think it would come to this . i guess i am , boss .
i will not have any damned ultimatums put to me , lou . i will accept your resignation .
sad thing is the way it is screwing up this country , all these hippies running around on drugs , the way young people look you cannot tell a boy from a girl anymore . i saw a girl the other day , she was pregnant you could see her whole belly , and you know what she painted on it ? love child . it is fucking outa control . values have gone to hell , jim . . . course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat johnson in the white house .
i sometimes feel things have gone downhill since john kennedy was killed , senator .
i thought the fbi test fired the rifle to make sure it could be done ?
sure , three experts and not one of them could do it ! they are telling us oswald got off three shots with world class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds and according to his marine buddies he got maggie s drawers he was not any good . average man would be lucky to get two shots off , and i tell ya the first shot would always be the best . here , the third shot s perfect . do not make sense . and then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits kennedy and connally seven times . one pristine bullet ? that dog do not hunt .
you know , something always bothered me about that from day one , and i cannot put my finger on it .
if i were investigating , i would round up the best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in dallas that day . you been duck hunting ? i think oswald was a good old fashioned decoy . what would he say ? i am just a patsy . out of the mouth of babes y ask me .
hell , you are the district attorney . you read the warren report and then you tell me you are satisfied lee oswald shot the president all by his lonesome .
russell , honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire . i just cannot believe the chief justice of the united states would put his name on something that was not true .
welcome , district attorney garrison . may i call you jim ?
there have been a number of reports in reputable news media time , newsweek , our own nbc that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor , that you have intimidated and drugged witnesses , bribed them , urged them to commit perjury . what is your response ?
your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching , jerry . it indicates that the age of innocence is not yet over . but seriously , jerry , people are not interested in jim garrison they want the hard evidence ! they want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to . . .
some people would say you are paranoid .
well , if i am , why is the government concealing evidence ?
are they ? why would they ?
pictures like this do not show up on television !
sure they do . the camera can pick this up .
jim garrison ?
yes .
i am glad you came . i am sorry about the precautions .
i could give you a false name , but i will not . just call me x .
i have already been warned by the agency , mr . whoever . if this is another type of threat , i do not . . .
i do not . . . i cannot believe it . they killed him because he wanted to change things . in our time in our country ?
kings are killed , mr . garrison . politics is power , nothing more . but do not believe me . do not trust me . do your own work , your own thinking .
the size of this is . . . beyond me . testify ?
no chance in hell , mr . garrison . i would be arrested and gagged , declared insane and hospitalized . . . maybe worse . you , too . i can only give you background , you got to find the foreground , the little things . . . keep digging . y know you are the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of john kennedy . that is important it is historic .
i have not yet . i do not have much of a case .
well , thanks for coming .
you did not get that break you needed , but you went as far as any man could , bubba . what can i do for you ?
just speculating , i guess . how do you think it started ?
he is done it before . other countries . lumumba in the congo , trujillo , the dominican republic , he is working on castro . no big deal . in september , kennedy announces the texas trip . at that moment , second oswalds start popping up all over dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket . y flies in the assassins , maybe from the special camp we keep outside athens , greece pros , maybe some locals , cubans , maria hire , separate teams . does it really matter who shot from what rooftop ? part of the scenery . the assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone . . .
any chance of one of them confessing someday ?
. . . do not think so . when they start to drool , they get rid of em . these guys are proud of what they did . they did dealey plaza ! they took out the president of the united states ! that is entertainment ! and they served their country doing it .
. . . and your general ?
. . . got promoted to two stars , but he was never military , you know , always cia . went to vietnam , lost his credibility when we got beat over there , retired , lives in virginia . i say hello to him when i see him at the supermarket . . .
ever ask him ?
you never ask a spook a question . no point . he will never give you a straight answer . general y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more .
his name ?
i knew the man years . that is him . the way he walked . . . arms at his side , military , the stoop , the haircut , the twisted left hand , the large class ring . what was he doing there ? if anyone had asked him , he would probably say protection but i will tell you i think he was giving some kind of okay signal to those hoboes they are about to get booked and he is telling em it is gonna be okay , they are covered . and in fact they were you never heard of them again .
. . . some story . . . the whole thing . it is like it never happened .
it never did .
just think . . . just think . what happened to our country . . to the world . . . because of that murder . . . vietnam , racial conflict , breakdown of law , drugs , thought control , guilt , assassinations , secret government fear of the frontier . . .
here s my problem , jack . you told me you and guy were good friends for a long time ?
more than ten years .
and he never hit you before ?
never touched me .
how much more ?
i do not know if i should talk about this .
well , i would ask guy we were friendly , you know heart attack , was not it ?
if you buy what you read in the paper .
you have other information ?
i did not say that . all i know is he died suddenly just before the warren report came out .
why did guy beat you , jack ?
dave ferrie you know about him ?
was he there often ?
where is banister in all this ?
like i said , a fucking nuthouse .
yeah , he was there , too . . . sometimes he would be meeting with banister with the door shut . other times he would be shooting the bull with ferrie . but he was there all right .
anyone else involved at banister s level ?
clay something , that was his name clay .
bertrand . clay bertrand ?
yeah ! that is it . i do not know . maybe it was not . i gotta go .
clay bertrand . he is in the warren report . he tried to get oswald a lawyer . was kennedy ever discussed , jack ?
sure . course they hated the sonofabitch , but . . .
the assassination , jack ?
never . not with me sir , never . . . listen , i think i would better go . i said enough . i said all i am going to say .
hold on , jack . that is the problem ?
that is the problem ? that is the problem ? do i need to spell it out for you , mr . garrison ? i better go .
nobody knows what we are talking about , jack .
did not someone say he did not speak good russian ?
even my own wife , chief , who s wondering where i am ?
hold it , chief . . .
well , believe what you want , boss , but we got to be more careful . all these new volunteers , any one of them could be . . .
no , she could get hurt . if you believe that is happening to these other people .
she is the best damn witness we have !
hate mail here . fan mail here . the bad news is the irs has just requested an audit on your income from this office .
sure sounds like he is winning .
i do not think so , al . you remember the hemingway story , the old man and the sea ? the old fisherman manages to catch this great fish a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in . but by the time he reached shore , the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton .
then what are we going through all this trouble for ?
welcome , mr . miller . jim garrison . would you care for some coffee ?
i am glad you could find time to see me . i flew down from denver this morning on my private jet .
yes , your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there .
i have done quite well in denver , mr . garrison , but i have to admire someone like you and i have the means to back up what i say .
they have been enlarged and show a lot of detail . . .
where were you ? europe , pacific ?
germany .
you were lucky . i spent three years in the pacific . i have never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail bonding companies . why is that ?
i know about that shot . a terrible tragedy . how much do you have for carrying on your investigation ?
if you must know , virtually nothing .
how many men are working with you on this ?
less than you would guess . most days two to three assistant d . a . s . a handful of police investigators .
that is all you have had all this time ?
i am going to be very frank with you . you have done a great job , an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you . but the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion . you are not going to do this country any good , and you are not going to do yourself any good . you do not belong here . on this mickey mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops .
the job manages to keep me pretty busy .
i propose you accept an appointment to the bench in federal district court and move into a job worthy of your talent . do you have any idea , do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged ?
and what would i have to do ?
stop your investigation . . . it was a magnificent effort but it is over and done with . the press is already on your behind and that is only the beginning , my boy , only the beginning .
hello . is this jim garrisongs daughter ?
yes ?
virginia or elizabeth ?
virginia .
virginia , you are a lucky little girl . your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest . would you like to be in a beauty contest ?
that sounds fun .
i need some information from you then . how old are you ?
six .
and you get of from school at every day ?
yes .
do you walk home ?
then do you understand that i cannot tell the truth here ? in dallas . that there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth . . . who do not want me to have a retrial ?
when are you going back to washington , sir ?
i am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing i am going to have some lunch .
can i make a statement ? if you request me to go back to washington with you right now , that is if you want to hear further testimony from me , can you do that ? can you take me with you ?
no , that could not be done , mr . ruby . there are a good many things involved in that .
what are they ?
well , the public attention it would attract . and we have no place for you there to be safe , we are not law enforcement officials , and many things are at stake in this affair , mr . ruby .
but if i am eliminated there will not be any way of knowing . consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country , and i know i will not live to see you another time . my life is in danger here . do i sound screwy ?
well i do not know what can be done , mr . ruby , because i do not know what you anticipate we will encounter .
can i help you ?
this looks pretty good on me .
i think i am gonna just get this for today . i am in kind of a hurry . would you mind ringing this up while i change out of it ?
not a problem .
i am sorry , i just decided to stay in the suit get out of that damn uniform .
tomorrow i will talk to your probation officer . karengs a good kid , but she is mad at you , because you lied to her . this business about your grandmother s funeral
i went . i did . i took my mother and little brother .
but you did not ask permission . you broke a trust . if you had asked , karen probably would have let you . i am sure she would .
i know . that is why i went .
but then you told her you were home .
i do not know . maybe it is a language problem . anita , you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided , i will never write you again . you understand ?
i understand .
i understand .
then say yes , max . i understand .
so you are gonna call karen tomorrow ?
i will call her .
will not forget ?
what the fuck can i say ? i am serious , man . what the fuck can i say ? thank you . . . thank you . . . thank you .
who was there for your ass ?
you were there for me .
who ?
you see , it works like this . you get your ass in trouble , i get your ass out . that is my job . and i do not mind tellin ya , nigga , it is steady work .
i am still scared as a motherfucker , ordell . they talking like they serious about me doing that machine gun time .
naw , man . they just trying to put a fright in your ass .
if that is what they want to do , they are doing it .
how old is that machine gun shit ?
three years .
three years . that crime s old , man . they ai not got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killing people . how they gonna find room for you ?
that is not what they are telling me .
hey , c mon in , man . i was just you know smoking a fatty , watching tv .
naw , man . i gotta be someplace . i was kinda hopin you could come with me .

i need a favor .
that requires me going out tonight ?
a bit .
aaaaawww man , i was not planning on going no place . it is twelve o clock , man . i am home , i am high
that is the problem ?
well , it ai not so much a problem a a situation . remember i sold those three m machine guns outta the five i got ?
uh huh .
i am gonna sell the other two tonight . this group of koreans in koreatown have started a neighborhood watch kinda thing . and they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business . so i am gonna sell em my two machine guns tonight . only problem , i ai not never dealt with these koreans before . now i ai not worried . asians are by and large real dependable . they do not want no trouble . you might argue about price , but you ai not gotta worry about them shooting you in the back . but i got me kind of a rule . never do business with nobody you ai not never done business with before without backup . that is why i need you , backup .
man , i ai not ready to be going out nowhere
let me finish . can i finish ?
fuck that shit , man . i ai not shooting anybody .
what the fuck i tell you . you do not hafta shoot nobody . just hold the gun . they will get the idea .
i ai not gitting in that trunk .
we are only going to koreatown . you will be in there ten minutes .
uh uh . i ai not riding in that trunk no minutes . why do not i just ride with you ?
you cannot ride with me . the surprise effect is ninety percent of it .
well , i am sorry , man , but i ai not gitting in that trunk .
i cannot believe you do me this way .
i ai not doing you no way . i just ai not climbing in that trunk . i got a problem with small places .
well , my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful , peanuthead niggas outta jail , but i do it
look , man , i know i owe you
well , if you owe me , git your ass in the trunk .
i wanna help you , but i do not wanna be locked in the trunk of no car .
answer the question , nigga . do you think i wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass ? yes or no ?
course you did not .
does he have the marked bills on him ?
why were you with him ?
i went to give him his refund , so he would not have to come here .
how would you know where he was ?
i found out .
and you did not tell the police ?
i would say there s about , oh , fifty thousand dollars here . what would you say ray ?
you got a good lawyer ?
can she afford a good one is the question . otherwise she will be in sybill brand three weeks easy before the public defender gets around to her .
great , you are here .
that is going on ?
she wants to make a deal .
she sound scared ?
she almost sounds scared .
that is she want ?
she wants to go back to work .
that is she willing to give us ?
she has not one into specifics yet , she is been waiting for you .
she knows it is my case ?
we are . do not worry about it .
the envelope contains currency . . . all the same denomination , one hundred dollar bills . now , i am counting it .
can i have a word with you ?
hi , i am detective mark dargus . l . a . p . d . can i ask what you have in that bag ?
i doubt it . who s your friend ?
would i mind ? do i have a choice ?
you have the right to say no . and i have the right to make you wait here with ray while i go get a warrant . and if i do not want to go through all that trouble , i could just take you in on suspicion .
this is your money ?
you should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it . you forgot or what ? you could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine , plus two years in prison . now you want to talk to us about it , or you want to talk to customs ?
hey , this is my office . there s no smoking .
i am not a loser .
help yourself .
my pocketbook .
that is in it ?
that is this ?
oh , i would not be so sure . what with all the cash , i think i could go with conspiracy to traffic .
let me have a word outside with agent nicolet for a moment ?
take your time .
help us do what ?
but now you are telling us now you do .
you do not want much , do you ?
how was your flight ?
fine .
four thirty . i am meeting a woman .
that is her name ?
he would not say . you gonna follow her ?
she leaves , somebody will be on her .
i can give you a lift home if you would like ?
are you really a bail bondsman ?
i gave you my card there .
can i see your i . d . ?
who put up my bond ? ordell ?
can we stop for cigarettes ?
sure , ever been to the riverbottom ?
i do not think so .
it is okay . it is a cop hangout .
could not we just stop at a seven eleven ?
i thought you might want a drink ?
i would love one , but not there .
we could stop at the hilton by the airport .
is it dark ?
it is kind of a sports bar
that does not sound dark .
why does it need to be dark ?
cause i look like i just got outta jail , that is why . you dropping me off at home , right ? there s a place by me .
you gain weight ?
ten pounds . i lose it and put it back on .
that is why i do not quit . if i cannot fly anymore , i am gonna have a bitch of a time getting my brand .
that is your brand ?
davidoffs . i get em in mexico . they are hard to find here . i was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for busting her boyfriend s head open with a baseball bat .
was she helpful ?
she was more helpful than the fucking public defender . i do not know i guess what i need is a lawyer , find out what my options are .
you are not tired of it ?
what have they told you ?
so far i have been told i can cooperate and get probation , maybe . or , i can stand mute and get as much as five years . does that sound right ?
i would say if you are tried and found guilty you will not get more than a year and a day . that is state time . prison .
shit .
but they will not want to take you to trial . they will offer you simple possession , a few months of county time , and a year or two probation . how about another ?
you know who put the dope in your bag ?
yeah , but that is not what this was about . they were fuckin waiting for my ass . they knew i had that money , they even knew the amount . the one who searched my bag , from l . a . p . d . , dargus , hardly even looked at it . oh , i would say there s fifty thousand here . what would you say ? but all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to customs , and i could tell they did not want to do that .
they wanted you to tell them what you know .
i had em too . i burnt those two starky and hutch motherfuckers down . then their asses lucked out and found that coke .
what did they want to know ?
that would be beaumont livingston .
that is him . how do you know em ?
i wrote him on monday . they found him dead on tuesday .
ordell pick up his bond ?
same as you . ten thousand .
the federal agent kinda half hinted ordell might of done beaumont .
you mentioned a guy from l . a . p . d . , but you did not mention the federal .
i did not ?
no , you did not . what branch ?
he is the one who wants you .
it was the other guy who busted me .
cause if he busted you , you would play hell bonding out of federal court . he does not want you mad at him , he wants you to tell him what you know . he uses you to get a line on ordell , make a case , then take him federal . you know what ordell s into ?
i used to bring over ten thousand at a time . that is the legal limit , so i never brought more than that .
how many trips did you make ?
with ten thousand ? nine .
he is got that kinda money ?
it is all in lock boxes in a mexico bank . but he is got a problem . he is what do you call it when you got money , but do not have cash ?
cash poor ?
that is it . he is cash poor . he kept on me till i finally said okay . i will bring whatever fits in a nine by twelve envelope . i got paid five hundred dollars , and his friend , mr . walker , in mexico gave me the envelope .
whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened . this ai not solving my problem . i gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble . i am off today , but if i cannot leave the country i am out of a job . and if i do not got a job , i cannot hire a lawyer .
ask a . t . f . they might give you permission .
yeah , if i cooperate .
well , jackie , you got caught , you are gonna have to give em something .
but if all i can give em is ordell s name i do not really know shit about what he does or how he does it that do not give me much to bargain with .
what wouldya think ?
if you are having some .
you get a chance to use it ?
i felt a lot safer having it . my milk went bad when i was in jail .
thanks , but i have my own now .
what , i could not hear you ?
somebody loan it to you ?
want to hear some music ?
i could not wait till i got home last night and wash my hair .
you never got into the whole cd revolution ?
this is pretty .
uh huh .
who is this ?
the delfonics .
?
, i think .
i called in sick this morning . as far as the airline knows , i am still available .
are you ?
i do not know yet . i am going to talk with dargus and nicolet today . do what you suggested . offer to help and see what happens .
what i meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you .
i want to talk to them first . i know more now about ordell s money .
well , if the a . t . f . guy is the one who wants you , that will only interest him up to a point .
it is a lot of money . about a half a million dollars . all of it in cabo in safe deposit boxes and more coming in .
how would you find that out ?
he told me last night .
he called you ?
he came by .
what ? . . . what would you do ?
he had his doubts at first . but he is always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can .
why ?
he needs me . without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in cabo . sugar ?
how do you get it out ?
same way i been doing , but first they got to let me go back to work .
you are gonna offer to set him up ?
if i get let off . otherwise , fuck em .
it is very possible ordell s killed somebody .
how do you feel about getting old ?
you are not old . you look great .
i am asking how you feel . does it bother you ?
it is not really something i think about .
really ?
okay , i am a little sensitive about my hair . it started falling out ten years ago . so i did something about it .
how would you feel about it ?
i am fine with it , or i would not of done it , i did it to feel better about myself , and i do . when i look in the mirror it looks like me .
it is different with men .
my ass ai not the same .
bigger ?
does something else worry you ?
i just feel like i am always starting over . you said how many bonds you wrote ?
fifteen thousand .
well , hello .
i walked right past you .
i know , ignoring me . what are you up to ?
catching a movie .
what would ya see ?
american president
how was it ?
pretty good . me and annette bening are goin steady .
oh , are you ? does she know that ?
does it happen to all men ?
well , i would never be so bold as to speak for all men , but as or myself and a few of my friends , that is definitely the case . there s a lot of actresses out there you like , and there s some you have crushes on . but there s always one who you love . and with her it is sorta like going steady .
and annette s it for you ?
who was your girl before annette ?
sandra bullock . you know her ?
yeah , she is the girl who drove the bus in speed . she is cute .
she is adorable . but i had to end it .
why ?
i am old enough to be her father .
how old s annette ?
what are you , a bag lady ?
i go back to work tomorrow .
you talk them into it ?
they seem to like the idea .
bring the money in and they follow it ?
yea , but i am going to dress it up . put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone i meet here .
you do not actually do it that way ?
he always just picked it up at my place . but with a . t . f . involved , i want to stage it . you know , make it look more intriguing , like we know what the fuck we are doing . then it is up to ray nicolet , the a . t . f . guy to follow the shopping bag .
make the delivery somewhere in the mall .
right around here , in the food court .
will ordell go for that ?
i am helping him bring his money into america . he loves the idea . you just missed him .
he was here ?
yeah , we were going over everything . that is why all the bags .
i called you last night .
i know , i got your message . ray wanted to have dinner . he wanted to talk about the sting we are plotting . that is what he calls it . a sting . he is being real nice to me .
you think he is got a thing for you ?
maybe . but i am thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself .
i do not follow your logic . what does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting ordell s money ?
he is setting me up to make a proposition .
i see .
you do not propose something like that unless you are pretty sure the other persongs into it .
has he hinted around ?
not really . but i knew this narcotics cop one time . told me that in a raid , the whole package never gets back to the station . his exact words .
you know some interesting people .
he were not bullshitting either , cause later he was suspended and forced to retire .
he tries to act cool .
no harm in that . he is a young guy having fun being a cop . i know the type , trust me on this . he is more interested in ordell than the money . if he is gonna do anything suspect , it will be cutting corners to get the conviction but he would not walk off with the money . it is evidence .
what about you max ?
what ? if i was in nicolet s place ?
no , i mean you , right now . not it you were somebody else .
if i saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money , would i take it ?
you know where it came from . it is not like it is anybody s life savings . it would not even be missed .
a half a million dollars will always be missed .
you are avoiding the question .
i have to stand behind all my active bonds , but i am not writing any new ones .
why ?
a lot of reasons . but the main one would be i am tired of it .
when did you decide ?
hi , i am max cherry . your bail bondsman .
the day you got me out of jail ?
yeah , that night i went to pick up a guy . i hear he is staying at this house , so i sneak in , wait for him to come home .
wait a minute . after we were together you went and snuck into a guy s house ?
got another gun and a stun gun . . .
and went to this guy s house in el monte , and i waited for him .
what do you do when he comes home ?
shoot him with the stun gun . while he is incapacitated , cuff him , take em to county .
you do that ?
that is my job .
did you do it that night ?
he never came home . but i am sitting on the couch , in the dark , holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew so after a couple hours i think , what am i doing here ? nineteen years of this shit ? so i made up my mind , that is it .
and is that it ?
i am not sure you answered my question .
which one ?
if you had a chance , unemployed now , to walk off with a half million dollars , would you take it ?
do not even think about it . you could get yourself killed go to prison . . .
the feds . it is evidence .
you are rationalizing .
i told them ordell s changed the amount he is bringing in .
do you think they bought it ?
oh , yeah . i got them thinking ordell s real nervous . they love thinking he is scared of them .
you know , a good cop will not let you know he knows you are fulla shit .
it will be more than that .
do not be so literal . ray believed it .
but you still have to show him the money at the airport .
well , you know i am not going to show him the whole amount . he will see fifty thousand .
where is the rest of it ?
in the bag underneath .
what if he checks it ?
he will not i mean , he did not the last time . he will be expecting fifty thousand and there it is on top .
you are taking a helluva chance kid .
not really . if he finds it , i say mr . walker put the money in , and i did not know nothing about it . like the coke .
then you are out and you get nothing .
yeah , but i am not in jail and i tried .
you are gonna have surveillance all over you .
that is why you do not make a move till i come out of the fitting room .
in a dress .
how would you find out ?
all winston had to do was ask around . ordell s living in long beach with a woman junkie .
how does winston find him if a . t . f . and all the local police cannot ?
people talk to winston . he is street , same as them , they trust him . they get busted , they know somebody who can bond them out . i thought i might drop in on him . he will no doubt be surprised to see me .
he is liable to shoot you .
ray wants him .
that is why a . t . f . s gotta make the case . i am their witness . they would not have a case without me . if it is his word against mine , who are they gonna believe ?
it never was , so i am not gonna start worrying about it now . look , ray more or less believes my story , and he more or less does not care . all he really gives a shit about is getting ordell .
so how do we give ordell to nicolet ?
get ordell to come to your office .
set him up .
uh huh .
tell him you want to see him ?
tell him i want to give him his money .
why ?
i have chickened out . i am afraid of him . he will like that .
what do you tell nicolet ?
ordell called and wants to meet me and i am scared .
he is already there .
what if he hears something he is not supposed to ?
i got your package . it was fun getting a half a million dollars in the mail .
less ten percent .
only this is not a bail bond , max .
i hesitated taking that much .
you worked for it if you are sure that is all you want .
i saw ray the other day . boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement .
that is he doing ?
he is on to a new thing . he is after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is woefully and wantonly selling assault rifles to minors . he says he is gonna take him down if it is the last thing he does .
did you tell him you were leaving ?
that is ordell s .
they have confiscated all his other stuff . but this one s sorta left over . the registrationgs in the glove box , the keys were under the seat . . . that is a matter , have not you ever borrowed someone s car ?
i did not use you , max .
i did not say you did .
i never lied to you .
i know .
we are partners .
i am fifty five years old . i cannot blame anybody for anything i do .
i would feel a whole lot better if you took some more money .
where are you going ?
spain .
madrid or barcelona ?
wanna go ?
thanks , but you have a good time .
sure i cannot twist your arm ?
thank you for saying that , but no . my business .
i thought you were tired of your business ?
i am just tired in general .
you tell those guys they will have to do one helluva lot better than that before i will even say hi to them .
well , that is the state s offer . if you plead to possession and tell l . a . p . d . what they want to know , your bond will be set at one thousand dollars . if you do not , l . a . p . d . will request one at twenty five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight . if you do not post it or do not know anyone who can , you will spend six to eight weeks in county before your arraignment comes up .
who s side are you on ?
i beg your pardon ?
what if i plead guilty ?
and cooperate ? you might get probation .
if i do not cooperate ?
he say we like the same thing as married .
most of the times .
sometimes every day , for a while .
yes m .
you know that is in the bag you are taking ?
he say is a surprise .
oh , miss brown ?
and what would this be , sweet and low ?
what the fuck is that shit ?
i know what it looks like .
look , that shit ai not mine .
we will just be a minute .
thanks for waiting , jackie . now tell me , what can we do for you ?
i need permission to leave the country so i keep my job .
we can look into that .
i need it tomorrow . if i do not show up for work tomorrow , i am fired .
you know what we want .
oh , so now you know him ?
no shit . you know how he makes his money ?
he sells guns .
you ever see him sell guns ?
no .
then how do you know he sells guns ?
he told me . besides , why else would an a . t . f . man be after him ?
how can you help us ?
this is a . t . f . agent ray nicolet , jackie brown , ordell robbie money exchange trial run . it is three p . m . , july th . the location is the parking structure at lax .
i am recording this .
the envelope contains ten thousand dollars . the subject will be delivering the currency in a . . .
ordell has a white guy working for him named louis .
you two meet ?
this afternoon before i came here . he was with ordell at an apartment in hermosa beach . i do not know if he lives there , but i can find out .
you talk to him ?
not really .
his full name is louis gara . he just got out from serving four years in susanville .
what for ?
bank robbery ? do you know what he does for ordell ?
i imagine shit needs to be done .
. . . compton with a fifty six year old petty thief woman named simone hawkins .
ever meet her , or they talk about her ?
not yet .
who s the other one ?
white girl named melanie ralston . another girlfriend of ordell s .
that is her story ?
it was her coke i got busted with . she knows everything , but she is not part of it , and she is pissed cause she is not part of it . ordell would not even let her stay at the meeting . she tried to talk me into ripping off ordell .
and splitting with her ?
i am sure that was the idea .
what did you say ?
i smiled and walked away . she also told me ordell killed beaumont .
she told you that ?
uh huh .
was she there ?
she did not say .
but she mentioned beaumont by name ?
uh huh .
well , this sounds like a lady i would like to have a word with . so everything s set for tomorrow ?
you said that the last time .
well , it is true , is not it ? after this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else . what do you think ?
we could , if i am not in jail .
that is fifty thousand , huh ? it does not look like that much .
i was told ten thousand in each pack .
you did not count it ?
ever been tempted ?
what ? to put one of these in my pocket ?
uh huh .
if i did , i would have to give you one , would not i ? or we could take what we want . no one knows how much there is except us , right ?
yes . all those things are true .
after all , it do not belong to nobody , right ?
that would be one point of view .
yeah , well , it is not a point of view that a . t . f . shares . once we make it evidence , it belongs to us . you are now officially out of trouble . do not do nothing stupid , now .
how can i do anything if i am being watched every second ?
i am glad you realize that . saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you . put this in your shopping bag . it is what i expect to find when i look in sheronda s . comprende ?
i thought i did .
you did not . i would think with all this on your mind , you would wait till after .
i got there early . i have had my eye on this suit wait , let s start over . i got there early . the idea was to try on the suit , see if i liked it . if i did , get them to wrap it up , and change back into my uniform . that is what sheronda s expecting me to wear . go meet sheronda , give her the bag with fifty thousand , and go home .
but you did not do that .
where is the bag she gave you ?
she did not give me one . i told you before , melanie was not part of the plan . ordell must of told her to do it . she bursts in , grabs the shopping bag , and takes off . what am i supposed to do , go after her ? i am in my fucking underwear . i had to get dressed before i could do anything . so i put this back on cause could put this on faster than i could my uniform .
you took the time to pay the saleswoman .
i had to . i was frantic . i did not know what to do .
what did you do after that ?
i went looking for you . i went straight to the bookstore , cause that is where you were last time , but you were not there . how the hell else am i supposed to let anybody know what happened ? you did not tell me how to do that , did you ? i knew i was under surveillance , so when i could not spot anybody , i started yelling .
there was a guy with melanie ?
we had our agent on you . she sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a robinsongs may bag and tussle with a tough looking white guy . the white guy takes the shopping bag and they go .
this guy with melanie , that was louis gara ?
i did not see him . i was in my underwear . if it was a white guy , it was probably louis . he kill melanie ?
it is possible . you are saying you do not have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand ?
i have no idea .
you would take a polygraph on it ?
if it will make you happy .
louis gara s dead . l . a . p . d . found him dead in a car on ninth . and we have lost ordell .
i thought you were watching him .
we were , and we lost him . he walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out . the bar was on ninth , less than a mile and a half from where louis was found dead . it looks like louis s friend shot him twice at point blank range .
so what happens now ?
we pick up ordell . we have got three murders we can link him to . we have the storage unit where he keeps his guns , by tomorrow we will have a search warrant to go in and get him . and we have you .
what about me ?
what about you ?
do you think i took some of that money ?
oh , hi .
buy ya a beer ?
i am waiting for the phone .
good luck . that guy s been in there since i got here .
sure .
killiangs .
better get me another sam s . join me in a jaeger shot ?
uh uh .
how long you been with ordell ?
this time ? almost a year . i have known him forever .
what were you two fighting about ?
mr . walker s my buddy . ask him about ordell .
he said he did not know about it .
he killed a guy who works for him the other day .
beaumont livingston ?
you already knew that ?
kinda .
you think i am kidding ?
dreaming .
you know how easy it would be ? he will not be anywhere near that mall . pull one more switch , up front . that is it . half a million dollars . need help ?
keep it between us girls ?
that is that fucker ever done for us ?
jackie ?
hi , melanie .
are you getting that black suit ?
yeah , do you like it ?
it looks good on you .
do you got something for me ?
i put a little cherry on top . you are right . what the hell he ever do for us ?
thanks .
how you doing , ms . jackie ?
i got some vodka in the freezer .
got some o . j . ?
well , then , why do not you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver ?
for what ?
the same guy who put me in , thanks a lot .
i amagine they asked who you giving it to , too .
they asked .
and what was your answer ?
i said i wanted to talk to a lawyer .
beaumont livingston .
i knew it .
yeah ?
this fella beaumont , they say what happened to him ?
what do you think it is ?
i think it is a gun pressing against my dick .
what the hell you doing ?
now , baby , that is got nothing to do with you . i just carry that . you been listening to them cops too much .
the cops did not try and strangle my ass .
damn , jackie , i was just playing with you .
well , i ai not playin with you . i am gonna unload both these motherfuckers , you do not do what i tell you . understand what i am saying ?
baby , i ai not come here she shoves both guns in ordell s back .
i said , you understand what i am saying
i understand woman , damn !
i am telling you , those cops been fucking wit your mind . they turn black against black , that is how they do .
i just came here to talk .
let s get realistic , baby . sooner or later they are gonna get around to offering me a plea deal , and you know that . that is why you came here to kill me .
baby , i did not
yeah ?
i got a problem . . .
yeah .
i will talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it is on .
the cockatoo inn .
the cockatoo inn ? where is that ?
it is right on hawthorne boulevard and manhattan beach boulevard . it is red brick . . .
oh , wait , you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it ?
i bet you come here on a saturday night , you need nigga repellent keep em off your ass .
i do okay .
you a fine looking woman , jackie . i bet you do a damn sight better than okay . you think anybody followed you ?
i do not think so , but it do not really matter . they know i am meeting you .
how the fuck they know that ?
you told em ? you told em it is me ?
they already know it is you .
well , shit . that do not mean you gotta confirm it !
look , the only way i can get permission to fly is if i agree to help them . which is what i have to appear to be doing . so i give them something they already know . you .
didja tell em anything else ?
you told them that ?
it is true , is not it ?
what the fuck s that got to do with it ?
they know i am delivering for you . i mention the half million they do not give a fuck about that they want you with guns . so i say , well , if you want proof he is getting paid for selling them , let me bring the money in .
. . . i make two deliveries . the first one with ten thousand , like a dry run . they watch it . see how it works . then we do a second delivery , when i bring in the half mill .
naw , naw , that is too much exposure . i ai not goin anywhere near that money .
you do not have to . i told em you are real careful . you never pick up money yourself . you always send someone , and i never know who it is .
that is a good idea .
if you just listen , you will see it is a damn good idea . the first time i do it they are lurking about . they see me hand the ten thousand to someone .
who ?
i do not know . one of your friends .
a woman .
if you want .
yeah , i think a woman .
the next trip , when i come with all the money , it will look like i hand it to the same one i did before . . .
but you do not ?
no , i give it to someone else first .
and they follow the wrong one thinking she is bringing it to me .
that is the idea .
so we need two people , two women .
can you cover that ?
i got the woman covered . where you thinking about doing this ?
i was thinking the del amo mall . in the food court .
i suppose you see a piece of this for yourself ?
well , it is my plan . we are in this together .
yeah , but it is my money , and i do not need me a partner .
i ai not your partner , i am your manager . i am managing to get your money out of mexico , into america , in your hands , and i am managing to do all this under the nose of the cops . that makes me your manager , and managers get fifteen percent .
managers get ten percent .
that is an agent . manager s get fifteen percent .
i will give ya ten .
plus the same deal as before .
the money s in a broadway shopping bag . i get some food , and sit down here in the food court . then your girl comes you got somebody yet ?
uh huh .
who ?
what would you care ?
look , it is my ass facing the penitentiary . you send some hard headed roc whore , and she fucks things up .
drink ?
i do not want no more fucking surprises . we do this the way i laid it out , or we do not do it at all .
what the hell you talking bout ?
sheronda passing the money onto someone else , that is what the hell i am talking about .
how do you know she did that ?
i was there , i saw her do it .
well , you were not supposed to be there .
i know , but i hung around , cause i figured you would try ang pull some shit like this .
now , hold on there . i ai not pulling no shit . it is my money , i can do whatever the fuck i wanna do with it .
nicolet and dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills .
man , i do not like that part .
it washes off . i tell them we are doing it the same way as before . they will follow sheronda . i hate the idea of leaving her for a fall .
she will not have no problems cause she do not know nothing .
are you sure she do not know about the money ?
she do not know shit about the money .
what does she think she is gettin ?
no , you gonna give her a robinsongs may bag this time ?
right , the one simone gives me . simone and i will make the switch at robinsongs may . she knows what i look like ?
she saw you with sheronda . so simone goes to the dress department with her robinsongs may bag .
designer clothes .
she waits for you to go in the place where you try things on .
so you come out with her robinsongs may bag , go meet sheronda . simone peeks out , waits for my man louis here to give her a signal nobody s watching . she leaves the store , gets in her car mission accomplished .
where you gonna be during all this ?
who s paging you ?
ray , the a . t . f . guy .
that works on my nerves , you being so buddy buddy with him .
if i was not , this would not work . now once i deliver i will have to trust you .
and a hundred thousand if i go to jail .
give it to the bail bondsman , max cherry . he will take care of it .
max cherry ? you and him friends now ? you tell him about this shit ?
it is boring , is not it ?
i can sit through it once .
he thinks he is joe gunn now .
i am impressed . he knows a lot .
want a hit ?

then what ?
we went to the parking lot .
where you shot her .

fuck you for asking me that .
what would you shoot her with ?
okay , so it was jackie brown .
if she is got it , why did not she take it all ?
fore i blow that bitch s brains out , i will ask her .
maybe the feds got it .
if there were nothin in here but towels , maybe she did not get a chance to take it from her suitcase and a . t . f . got it . but , she put these fucking books in here to trick our ass .
that is why i never checked it . the bag felt right .
then she throws forty thousand in here , to rub the shit in my face , know what i am saying ? she wants me to know she ripped me off .
i do not know . either she has it or the feds .
jesus christ .
what ?
you know who i saw in the dress department ?
tell me .
i did not really think anything of it . no i did wonder what he was doing there , but did not think it had anything to do with us . you know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend .
you gonna tell me who it was ?
you see max cherry in the dress department . we are about to be handed half a million dollars man , look at me when i am talking to you ! and you do not think nothing of him being there !
do max cherry and jackie brown know each other ?
hell , yes , they know each other . he bonded her out of county .
how am i supposed to know that ?
you know the motherfucker s a bail bondsman , do not ya ? you know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell ?
why should i think anything s weird , if i do not know nothing about them knowing each other ?
i ai not giving you fucking excuses , i am giving you reasons .
i am going out for a few hours .
hold on a minute . where you going ?
i am going to del amo , see a movie , get something to eat .
watcha gonna see ?
whatever looks best and starts the soonest .
you are right , that was ordell . you have time , you think you could find out for me where he is staying ?
cops cannot locate him , huh ?
they do not have your winning personality .
sure thing . i do not have to know what i am doing , long as you know .
how can i help you ?
that is winston . he works here .
he is a big one . you two tight ?
yeah .
so , you want a ten thousand dollar bond . what have you got for collateral ?
gonna have to put up cash .
it is in my bag .
you have cash . what do you need me for ?
c mon , you know how they do . black man comes in with ten thousand , they wanna fuck with em . first off , they gonna wanna know where i got it . second , they gonna keep a big chunk of it start talking that court cost shit . fuck that shit , jack . i will go through you .
cost you a thousand for the bond .
who s it for ? a relative ?
fella named beaumont . they have him up at county . it started out drunk driving , but they wrote it up possession of a concealed weapon . dumb monkey ass had a pistol on him .
ten thousand sounds high .
he takes off and i gotta go to kentucky to bring him back , you pay the expenses .
that is his full name ?
getting there .
beaumont livingston .
livingston , huh ?
on his prior , he served nine months , and he is working on four years probation .
you do not say .
do you know what he is on probation for ?
have not a clue .
possession of unregistered machine guns .
will they consider this a violation of his probation ?
they do consider this a violation of his probation . your boy s looking at ten years , plus the concealed weapon .
man , he will not like that . beaumont do not got a doing time disposition .
i need your name and address .
ordell robbie . o r d e l l . r o b b i e . florence boulevard . compton .
house or apartment ?
house .
across the street a great western . it goes in a trust account . you will need to fill out an application for appearance bond , an indemnity agreement , a contingent promissory note . that is the one , if beaumont skips and i go after him , you pay the expenses .
hey , max .
yes .
comfortable ?
the door was opened , so i just came right in .
i can see that . why ?
i got some more business for ya .
oh , yeah ? what did he do ?
she is an airline stewardess . got caught coming back from mexico with some blow . they set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand . now , what i was thinking , you could use the ten thousand you owe me from beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess .
the bond for possession is only a thousand .
they fucking wit her . they calling it possession with intent . a black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her , they call that shit intent . same shit happened to a movie star . it is possession .
it still sounds high .
she had , i believe it was . . . fifty grand on her , too . there was a cop at the hearing . young guy with l . a . p . d . wanted her bond set at twenty five thousand , saying there was a risk of flight . jackie being a stewardess and all .
somebody already did .
what ?
you did not hear ?
hear what ?
somebody with a grudge blew beaumont s brains out hey , that rhymes blew beaumont s brains out .
did the police contact you ?
very first motherfucking thing they did . they see i put up a big money bond on my boy , they start thinking with that where there s smoke there s fire logic . they roust my ass outta bed , ten o clock in the morning . fucking scare my woman , sherona , half to death . she thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure .
the stewardess . do you know her last name ?
brown , jackie brown .
what does she do for you ?
who says she does anything for me ? she is my friend . when my friends get into trouble , i like to help em out .
beaumont worked for you .
that is what the police thought . i told them i am unemployed , how could i have anybody work for me ? now i bail out jackie , i am liable to have the police on me again , huh ? wanting to know was she doing things for me , was she bringing me that money !
was she ?
is this , me and you , like a lawyer client relationship ? the lawyer cannot tell nothing he hears ?
you are not my client until you get busted and i bond you out .
if there s no what do you call it confidentiality between us ? why would i tell you anything ?
cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are . you got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand .
why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand ?
you want me to speculate on what you do . i would say you are in the drug business , except the money s moving in the wrong direction . whatever you are into , you seem to be getting away with it , so more power to you . okay you want another bond , and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on beaumont to the stewardess . that means paperwork . i have to get a death certificate , present it to the court , fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral , then type up another application . an indemnity agreement
jackie ai not got time for all that shit
i am telling you what i have to do . what you have to do , in case you forgot , is come up with premium of a thousand bucks .
i got it . i just do not got it on me .
well , come back when you do , and i will bond out the stewardess .
man , you know i am good for it . thousand bucks ai not shit .
if i do not see it in front of me , you are right . it ai not shit .
man , you need to look at this with a little compassion . jackie ai not no criminal . she ai not used to this kinda treatment . i mean , gangsters do not give a fuck but for the average citizen , coupla nights in county fuck with your mind .
ordell , this is not a bar , an you do not have a tab .
just listen for a second . we got a forty year old , gainfully employed black woman , falsely accused
falsely accused ? she did not come back from mexico with cocaine on her ?
falsely accused of intent . if she had that shit and mind you , i said if it was just her shit to get high with .
where is it ?
that is up with this shit .
you know who this is ?
the bond collateral on beaumont livingston you moved over to cover miss brown , remember ?
she got off , huh ?
you still there ?
what the fuck you doing knockin on the door like the goddamn police ? you looking to get shot ?
i thought you might be asleep .
i am alone .
that is all ?
i have a bond receipt for you to sign .
you know what the fuck i am talking about . you talk to her ?
she wants to give you your money . if she did not , there would be cops batter ramming the door right now .
how would you find me ?
winston found you .
how the fuck did he find me ?
that is what winston does . he finds people who do not want to be found .
well , bully for that nigga . you say she wants to give me the money , huh ?
uh huh .
well , give it to me then .
she wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent . she also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it .
jackie did not trust melanie . she would already tried to get jackie to go in with her , split the half million amongst themselves . what she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money .
lift up your pant leg . you help her ?
all i did was walk out with it .
and you did that to protect my interest ?
in a way , yes .
this place stinks .
you get used to it after a while . now tell me where my money s at .
my office .
and where is jackie ?
she is been there since thursday night .
she wanted to see me , why was not she home ?
she was afraid .
that i gotta see .
she still is . she does not want to get shot before she can tell you what happened .
have her bring the money here .
it is in the safe . she cannot get at it .
call her , tell her the combination .
i am telling you , you got her spooked . she will not leave there till you have your money and you are gone .
you expect me to just walk in there ?
if she wanted to set you up , you would be in custody right now . when you said you would name her as an accessory she believed you . that scares her more than anything .
that is why she is giving up my money huh ? not that bullshit about melanie . i did not trust her ass neither , but i knew how to handle her . she was my blonde headed little surfer gal . i fucking told louis he could have just given her a punch in the mouth , he did not need to shoot her . she is at your office .
uh huh .
by herself . that big mandingo nigga winston ai not there , is he ?
she is all alone .
i call your office , she better answer the phone .
it is the next street .
i know where it is .
turn left .
my money s in that office , right ?
uh huh .
she starts giving me some bullshit about it ai not there . it is somewhere else and we can go get it . i am shooting you in the head right then and there . then i am gonna shoot her in the kneecap , find out where my godamn money is . i go walking in there and that nigga winston or anybody else is in there , you are the first man shot , understand what i am saying ?
yeah .
now , is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car ?
no .
you sure ?
yes .
get that for me , will ya baby ?
who is it ?
we are back .
hey , hey , hey . i think somebody s got some new clothes .

how do you know ?
something weird is going on here . what is it about us ? even in nam it was always weird . are we all crazy or something ?
grass never did that to me .
too late . i have tried . i think you are right , jake . i am game .
daddy !
oh god !
you are hurting me !

daddy . let go .
what do you want from me ?
you have an unusual hand .
i could have told you that .
you know , you got a strange line here .

oh , terrific .
it is not funny . according to this . . . you are already dead .
what did he talk about when you guys went out ? did he say anything ?
hello .
listen , i just got a strange call from geary . he said the guys backed down . that is he talking about ?
that is right . we did .
what does that mean , frank ? i do not get it . why ?
it is hard to explain .
well , try , huh .
i do not know if i can . it is just that war is war . things happen .
things happen ? what the fuck are you talking about ? they did something to us , frank . we have to expose this .
there s nothing to expose .
jesus christ ! who s been talking to you ? that is going on ? how can you just turn away ? what about the others ?
they are not interested , jake .
shit ! you know it is not half the case if i go it alone . we are all suffering the same symptoms , frank . the army is to blame . they have done something to us . how can you not want to know ?
maybe it is not the army , jake .
what do you mean ?
maybe there s a larger truth .
what are you talking about ?
maybe the demons are real .
goddamn it . what kind of bullshit is that ?
listen , jake . i gotta go .
what the hell ? what kind of mumbo jumbo . . . ?
i am hanging up .
hey , wait !
daddy , what was that noise ?
gabe ? what are you doing . . . ?
there was a bang .
it was the window .
it is cold .
tell your mother .
wait . . . daddy .
now what ?
do not go .
i am sorry , mr . singer , but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world ? it would break your heart .
this is not injustice , mr . geary . the army did something to us and we have got to find out what .
the army . the army . what is it with you guys ? we are not talking about a trip to the library here . this is the united states government for god s sake . this is red tape coming out of your ass . you know what i mean ?
exactly . and we need someone to cut through it . we hear you are the man .
doctor . ph . d .
ah ! i thought you were a mailman .
i am .
then why are not you teaching ? why are not you in a university ?
i am too messed up to teach .
who s been talking to you ? the army ? have they been talking to you , huh ?
listen , will you listen ? they are trying to get me . they are coming out of the walls . the army s done something to me . i need you .
you need . . . a doctor .
you mind ? i am eating , huh ?
something s going on here . you are not telling me something . what the hell s gotten into you ?
i will tell you that is gotten into me . i do not know you from adam , right ? you come to my office with this bizarro story and demand i look into it . okay . i said i would check it out and i did . now i do not know what kind of fool you take me for , but you have used and abused me , and i do not like it .
used you ?
i talked to the army s bureau of records . you have never even been to viet nam .
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
it means that you and your buddies are whacko , that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in thailand .
war games ? thailand ? that is not true ! how can you believe that ? cannot you see what they are doing ? it is all a lie . we were in da nang , for god s sake . you have got to believe me .
bullshit . someone s covering something . that was no accident .
why do you say that ?
cars do not explode that way . any simpleton knows that .
but the paper . . .
what would he say that for ? what made him say that ? strange , huh ? strange .
what do you mean , demons ?
he was scared . he saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork . they were trying to get him , he said .
how long had that been going on ?
he say what they looked like ?
no . not really . . .
you think they are connected ?
it is not worth going over again and again . whatever happened , happened . it is over .
. . . i have seen them , too .
dr . carlsongs dead ?
not me , buddy .
come on , professor . the army s not gonna give you any answers . you will be butting your head against a stone wall .
maybe that is the only way to get through . besides , six heads will be better than one .
not my head , buddy . not me . i am getting a headache just listening to you .
we should get ourselves a lawyer .
come on , jake . that did not hurt .
how do you know ?
i know you . how come you are so tense today ?
what can i tell you ?
i saw sarah the other day .
her knee acting up ?
a bit .
what did she have to say ?
turn on your right side . how about the other right ? i do not understand you philosphers . you have got the whole world figured out but you cannot remember the difference between right and left .
i was absent the day they taught that in school . what did she say ?
who ?
sarah .
ah , good . now turn to your left .
she talk about the boys ?
she says she cannot get them new coats because you have not sent the alimony for three months .
she told you that ? did she tell you about the , i am still paying for the orthodontist ? i will bet she did not mention that .
she said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you .
i thought you said she did not say much .
loves me ! ? she has not said a kind word about me in years !
right . she does not stop talking about you . you are always on her mind . that is love , jake .
she hates me , louis .
you should go back to her .
what ? she threw me out , remember . she wanted some professor to carry her far away from brooklyn . only we did not make it . she cannot forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in .
her problem is that you spent eight years getting a phd and then went to work for the post office .
what can i tell you , louis ? after nam i did not want to think anymore . i decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos .
if it was any other brain but yours , i might agree . relax , this is going to be strong .
i cannot relax .
god almighty . what did you do to me ?
i had to get in there . a deep adjustment . rest a moment and let it set a bit .
i had this weird flash just then .
what ?
i do not know . i have been having them recently . you know , you look like an angel , louis , an overgrown cherub . anyone ever tell you that ?
yeah . you . every time i see you . no more errol flynn , okay ? your back will not take it . you tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows that is good for you .
louis , you are a life saver .
half an hour from now and you will be walking out of here all by yourself . mark my words . well , you have done it to yourself this time , have not you ?
am i dead , louis ? am i dead ?
from a slipped disc ? that would be a first .
i was in hell . i have been there . it is horrible . i do not want to die , louis .
well , i will see what i can do about it .
i have seen it . it is all pain .
perfect . we got it . okay . let s just give it a little try . see if you can stand .
what ? by myself ?
what are you doing ?
there s something i have gotta take care of , louis .
what are you talking about ? you can barely stand .
i am walking , are not i ?
jake , you need to rest .
are you in the service ?
the postal service . i am a mailman .
ah . neither snow nor sleet , nor dark of night . . . i always admired that .
it is good to see you .
and how is your wife ? sarah , no ?
i have not seen her in months .
ah !
i am with another woman now . we are both with the post office , midtown , th street branch .
hmm . i do not suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office ?
oh , you would be surprised . they just do not have their doctorates , that is all .
last i heard you were offered a posi tion in the west somewhere . tuscon was it ?
oh , that goes way back . they had a hiring freeze , one of those last min ute things . bad timing for me though . middle of the war . the draft . i will tell you prof , after viet nam . . . i did not want to think anymore . i decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos .
jacob , if it was any other brain but yours , i might agree . tell me , does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker , what a sub lime intellect she is living with ?
i doubt it is my mind that interests her . i tell you prof , she is a fiery lady .
i have got a problem , prof . more augus tine than kierkegaard , if you know what i mean . i need to know about . . . demons .
demons , jacob ? why demons ? are you writing . . . ?
no . i see them .
see them ? what do you mean ? physically ?
i know very little about demons , ja cob , fleshy ones anyway . i know them as literary figures , biblical ones . . . dante , milton . . . but jacob , this is the th century . we do not see demons now .
christ , i know how it sounds .
have you considered a doctor ? a psy chiatrist ?
yes . i do not want them . i am not looking for analysis or drugs . it is too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis . it is more than that . i can feel it . i need you prof . you are the only one i can talk to .
i do not know what to say .
demons ? i do not know what to tell you . it sounds like a spiritual mat ter to me . the problem , jacob , is that you have no context for it . you are a renegade existentialist suf fering demons a hundred years after freud . how the hell am i supposed to make it fit ?
i am afraid , prof . nothing makes sense . please help me .
jacob , i do not believe in demons , not in the empirical sense . i do not be lieve in devils fighting for our souls . i do not believe in enternal damnation . i do not believe in other worldly creatures tormenting us . we do not need them . we do a good enough job on ourselves .
but i see them .
look . i do not pretend to know that is going on inside your head . for all i know it is pathological and they should be pumping valium into your veins by the quart . but if you are not willing to accept the help of sci ence and believe me , i admire you for that then you will have to do bat tle on your own . what can i say ? it is a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls . but to be pursued by . . . demons no less . . . there are no guides , jacob . you wanna know what i would do if i sud denly started seeing demons ? i would hail the first taxi that came along , shoot over to bellvue and beg them for shock treatment . i am no saint .
hell , you think i am ?
i would like to speak to dr . carlson , please .
carlson ? is he new here ?
not according to my charts . do you have an appointment ?
look , i need to see him . i know where his room is . just give me a pass . i will not be long . ten minutes .
our doctors are seen by appointment only .
damn it . i was in the veterangs out patient program . he knows me .
that is your name ?
i am sorry but there s no record of a jacob singer in our files .
whataya mean , no record ?
you want me to spell it out ? there s nothing here .
that is ridiculous . i have been coming here for years . listen to me . i am going out of my fucking mind here . i need to see him .
if this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers . there s about an hour s wait . i will be glad to take your name . why do not you just fill out this form ?
what was that ?
it is freezing .
i am not cold .
of course not . you have all the blankets . it must be ten degrees in here . i am telling you , sarah , if you want to sleep with fresh air , you sleep on the fire escape . from now on that window is closed .
it is not healthy with it closed .
what a dream i was having . i was living with another woman . . . you know who it was ?
i do not want to know .
jezebel , from the post office . you remember , you met her that time at the christmas party . i was living with her . god , it was a nightmare . there were all these demons and i was on fire . only i was burning from ice .
guilty thoughts . see what happens when you cheat on me , even in your mind ?
she was good in bed , though .
go to sleep .
she had these real beefy thighs . delicious .
i am not dead . i am not dead .
jacob , what can i do ?
my back . i cannot move . i need my chiropractor .
they stole it .
who did ?
i do not know . santa claus . i had my songs picture in it . gabe s picture . it is the only one i had .
i am going to have to move you a bit , just to check for injuries . this may hurt a little .
i do not have to ask if you can feel that .
jake , is that you ?
what the hell did you do , move all the furniture ?
why did not you turn on the light ?
i did not want to wake you .
gee , thanks a lot .
where is the lamp ?
where are you ?
if i knew i would not have to ask . what did you do ? i was happy the way it was .
i moved the couch . that is all .

what do you think ?
what do you mean ?

eli . why cannot you remember their names ?
they are weird names .
they are biblical . they were prophets .
well , personally , i never went for church names .
and where do you think jezebel comes from ?
i do not let anybody call me that .
you are a real heathen , you know that , jezzie ? jesus , how did i ever get involved with such a ninny ?
you sold your soul , remember ? that is what you told me .
yeah , but for what ?
a good lay .
and look what i got .

i must have been out of my head .
jake , you are never out of your head !
that is in here ?
look at these , will ya ? i do not believe it . jesus , these are fantastic . look , here s my dad . . . and here s my brother , when we were down in florida .

that is sarah ? i can see what you mean .
what ?
why you left .
what do you mean you can see ?
look at her face . a real bitch .
she looked good then .
not to me .
is that the one who died ?
wait . do not .
i do not like things that make you cry .
ready ?
jake !
i am going home .
that is wrong ?
i do not know . one of these days , i am gonna see louis . my back s killing me .
well , i will miss riding home with you . i was looking forward to it .
i will be glad to avoid the crush .
maybe it is all the pressure , jake . the money . things like that . or your wife .
why do you bring her up ?
cause she is always on your mind .
when was the last time i said a word ?
it is still there , jake . even if you never say a word about it . you cannot spend two years in vietnam . . .
what does that have to do with anything ? does it explain the barricaded subway stations ? does it explain those godforsaken creatures ?
new york is filled with creatures . everywhere . and lots of stations are closed .
they are like demons , jez .
demons , jake ? come on . they are winos and bag ladies . low life . that is all they are . the streets are crawling with em . do not make em into something they are not . it is the pressure , honey . that is all it is .
those guys tried to kill me tonight . they were aiming right at me .
kids on a joy ride . happens all the time .
they were not human !

look , i am horny . keep it in mind . love me a little ?
so tell me . . . am i still an angel ?
we are all angels , you know . . . . . . and devils . it is just what you choose to see .
i love you , jez .
i know .
underneath all the bullshit , just love .
remember that .
you know what ? i feel . . . exorcised . . . like the demons are gone .
how come ? the army ?
i put a frozen dinner in the oven , a manhandler . it will be ready at a quarter of . i threw a little salad together . it is in the fridge . i also bought some apple juice , red cheek . do not drink it all . oh , and jake , your lawyer called .
he did ? when ?
while you were in the shower .
why did not you call me ?
he did not give me a chance . look , honey , do not get upset , but he is not taking your case .
what ? what do you mean ?
he said you did not have one .
that is he talking about ?
i do not know . that is all he said . he was not very friendly . oh , yeah . he said your buddies backed down . they chickened out , he said .
i do not believe this .
it is just me .
jezzie ?
who else were you expecting ?
let go !
where were you , jake ? where have you been ? why have not you called ?
stay away from me , jez .
i want to know . you tell me !
why are you doing this to me ? you cannot just go away like that .
do not !
it might be for me .
i am not here . you have not seen me .
who was that ?
a chemist . part of a chemical warfare unit out of saigon . he said he knows me and that i will know him when i see him .
how ?
i have no idea . i was right . there were experiments . i knew it . i knew it . my god .
what are you doing here ? are you all right ? how do you expect to pay for this ? everyone s looking for you , jake . i dodged people all over the place , reporters , police . i do not know what you are gonna do .
i am gonna make love to you . that is what i am gonna do .
are you out of your mind ?
yep . finally . i love you , jez .
god , i cannot keep up with all your changes .
me neither .
it is amazing , you know , that a drug could change things like that , destroy a life and then give it back . it is hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next .
i tell you , it was so wonderful . i felt like a little boy . i saw paradise , jezzie .
this is one of my dreams , jake . ever since i was a little girl . i never thought it would happen .
i want to go with you , jake . wherever you go .
it is not practical , jez . it will be hard enough alone .
i can waitress . i am good .
no . things are too hot . later . i will send for you .
bullshit !
i promise .
please .
no . i am a marked man , jez . i am the only one left . i do not want to expose you to that . it is not right for you or me . be reasonable .
reasonable ? reasonable ? jake . . . you are getting me angry .
i love you when you are angry .

sit down , jake .
where are they ?
sit down .
no ! that is going on ? where is my family ?
it is over , jake . it is all over .
where have they gone ?
that is going on ?
that is wrong , jake ? forget to take your antidote ?
who are you ? what are you doing to me ?
who are you ?
how many times have you asked me that ? how many times ?
tell me , damn you !
so tell me . . . am i still an angel ?
it is going to be all right , jake . it is going to be all right . do not be afraid . i have got you now .
why will not you answer me ?
cause you know goddamn well who i am .
i do not know you .
you have lived with me for two years .
that does not mean shit . where do you come from , huh ? and i do not mean indiana .
what do you want me to say ? my mother s tummy ?
you know goddamn well what i mean .
you are out of your fucking mind . i am not gonna stand around here getting interrogated by you .
well leave then . go to hell .
what would you do that for ? it is an in teresting story . all these people are still disappearing . right off the street . hey , that is wrong ? are you all right ?
i am okay . i just do not want to lis ten .
you look upset .
i am not upset .
jake , what is it ?
i am tired .
you look terrible . what happened ? jake . . . is it the antidote ?
goddamn it . why do you say that ?
look at yourself . you look like you have seen a ghost .
shit ! cannot i just have a bad day ?
you can have anything you want .
then do not bug me .
i am not bugging you . come and lie down . i will give you a massage . where would you go today ?
mid town mostly .
oh yeah ? what was happening there ?
i picked up my ticket . i am leaving in the morning , jez .
oh ? where you going ?
west .
where is west ? new jersey ?
do not be funny .
i always liked the west , west of il linois anyway . but you gotta give me time to pack .
stop it , jez . do not do that .
do what ? i have not done a thing .
where is sarah ? where are the boys ?
sit down , jake .
where are they ?
sit down !
no ! that is going on ? where is my family ?
it is over , jake . it is all over .
where have they gone ?
this is not happening .
oh god !
that is wrong , jake ? forget to take your antidote ?
goddamn you !
who are you ?
how many times have you asked me that ? how many times ?
tell me , damn you !
surprised , huh ? i told you you would know me . i have been tracking you for a long time . i just wish i would spoken to you before tonight .
i do not get it . who are you ? why have you been following me ?
so first i am arrested , right ? best lsd i ever made , right down the drain . i figure this is it , twenty years in the joint , if i am lucky . that was .
long time ago .
next thing i know i am on rikers island . ever been there ? suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows , you know . four army colonels , medals up their asses , are standing on the other side . they tell me if i will come to vietnam for two years , no action , mind you , just work in a lab , they will drop all the charges and wipe the record clean . well , i would only been in jail for thirteen hours and i already knew that nam could not be any worse .
shows how much you knew .
no shit . they had me by the balls . next thing i know i am in saigon . . . in a secret lab synthesizing mind altering drugs . not the street stuff mind you . they had us isolating special properties . the dark side , you know ? they wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies .
yeah , sure . we were losing the war .
right . they were worried . they figured you guys were too soft . they wanted something to stir you up , tap into your anger , you know ? and we did it . the most powerful thing i ever saw . even a bad trip , and i had my share , never compared to the fury of the ladder .
the ladder ?
anyway , this big offensive was coming up . everyone knew it time magazine , huntley brinkley . and the brass was scared cause they knew we could not win . morale was down . it was getting ugly in the states . hell , you remember .
like it was yesterday .
none of us can remember that night . i get flashes of it but they do not make sense . we saw shrinks for years . but nothing they did could ever touch it . what happened ? was there ever an offensive ?
a couple of days later . it was fierce . you guys never saw it .
but there was an attack . i can still see them coming . there was a fight , was not there ?
yeah . but not with the cong .
i always suspected the effects might come back . that is why i had to follow you . i had a hell of a time getting hold of your records .
if you knew , why did not you say anything ?
the truth can kill , my friend . five hundred men died out there . this is not a story they would ever want out . when paul s car blew up i realized the scope of the thing . i knew they meant business .
so why tell me now ?
you come here often ?
sometimes . when it is convenient .
how do i know this is not just some kind of , you know , seduction or something ?
i came up with the formula back in nam but i never got a chance to use it .
never ?
i would hoped i would never have to . just open your mouth and stick out your tongue .
what is it ?
do not worry . take it . it will free your head . come on .
i do not know .
yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i shall fear no evil , but no one ever said i would not be shitting in my pants every step of the way , huh ? stick out your tongue . that a boy . now why do not you just lie down and relax .
one drop ?
i think i am falling asleep .
i cannot move .
just relax .
and no more demons . i told you they would be gone .
i do not believe this . it is a miracle , michael . a miracle .
it was paradise , michael . you showed it to me . you were there .
well that is good to know .
mike , it was real . it was glorious .
glorious . i am not surprised . i fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven . i am just glad you came back .
i would have stayed there if i could .
here . i have got every credit card ever printed . take this . stay here till you can arrange to get away . it is on me .
no . i could not .
what ? you want the plaza ? do not be foolish . here . take this , too . this is my place on prince street . it is got my phone , everything . call if you need me . . . but you will not . everything s gonna work out . you just get outta town as fast as you can . the new york police can be effective when they want to be .
i do not know what to say .
excuse me , do you know if we have passed nostrand avenue yet ? excuse me . look , i am asking a simple question . have we hit nostrand avenue ? i fell asleep .
i no from around here .
how about over there ? no wait . do me a favor . bring em to the back room .
they are awfully heavy .
where is wong ?
how was palm springs ?
hot . where do i sign ?
you got a nice tan , though .
no . i will take the other one . right . well it is good to have you back . see you tomorrow , probably .

they keep telling me i am already dead , that they are gonna tear me apart , piece by piece , and throw me into the fire . i carry these everywhere but they do not help . nothing helps . everyone thinks i am crazy . my mother filed a report with the army .
the army ?
she said i have not been the same since then . since that night . there s still this big hole in my brain . it is so dark in there , jake . and these creatures . it is like they are crawling out of my brain . what happened that night ? why will not they tell us ?

goodbye , my love .
thorgan , suit up .
brodski ! get to lab two . we have an emergency !
we would need charges .

earth ii .
boeman , the ships not here .

i am an expert !
you are a teacher .
brodski i will talk slow so you can understand me . she is thawing . if we do not get her to the lab , she will die , and that will be on your bald fucking head !
how do you know that piece of cursed rock down there does not carry something metal tits cannot detect ?
well , when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her .
damnit , yllo ! i do not like it .
i do not give a shit . this one s prime for decryonization . we are brining her back .
i still think we should send for a team of real scientists .
i am a scientist you asshole ! this could be the most important discovery in years . do you have any idea what a find like this could mean ?
jesus what the hell is that ?
what the hell are you doing ?
my job .

yllo , that is your head count ?
all i am saying is dock with space lab , couple of hours no more . let them take a look at our friends .

lab two , relax . that is the matter ? he is dead .
he is dead . they are both dead . you do not understand what is on this ship . this is a being that kills . that is what he does . that is all he does . and he is very good at it .
i doubt that . i think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us .
i need to know what you know about this guy .
do not go out there . you cannot win . we need to get off this ship . that is all there is to it .
we need weapons .
jesus , god !

where are you going ?
you just need to relax . rizzo ti s the future . we have soldiers on board , e x grunts , the baddest of the bad . . . and their weapons ? i am sure are slightly more advanced than what you are used to .

rizzo , he is out there .
well , i am not hanging out here with ms . showtunes .
do not just stand there ! shoot him !
kkinsa , open the goddamn door !

rizzo ? !
hey .
that is a good fantasy , though . kinky , but good .
that is this ?
that is why i am here .
my father s company imports and exports . archaeology is part of the business . we happen to get along just fine , smartass . look , why do not you bust somebody else s balls for a change .
i thought you meant . . .
jason seemed to have the right stuff . physically , anyway . radiation , cell damage , did not matter . he just kept going .
they were all wrong . they could not control him .
i could not save them .
see ? we are not so bad .
you know , this future shit sucks . i will fucking do it .
you ?
got it . you ever space walked ?
his mother was killed before his eyes . that is what drove him insane . it will work .
that sounds like rizzo having faith in some of that future shit .
you wanna release your air tanks ?
okay , good tip .
rizzo , you okay ?
no i am not okay ! i do not know what the hell i am doing !
rizzo , did they have chinese food in your time ?
i think i had some when i was eight .
did you like it ?
delongpre , you do not even know me .
rizzo , pull away !
you okay ? !
oh great . . . yeah , having a great time , and you ?
no thank you , you crazy old woman .

it is time .
what about the others ? should not we wait ?
spunky . . .
well ?
she needs a little time .
that is really funny .
i would want her statements before we reach porch . jesus , women .
god damnit ! will you stop doing that ? !
shut up ! she just wants this thing dead !
we must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey .
i am thinking rizzo was right .
thinking with your dick again , delongpre ?
maybe we should go with them . like you said , your space lab connections can deal with this thing . at least we will be safe .
now hold on ! we should hear her out !
yuck .

i feel better . now how do you fire this damn thing ?
it is on the table where i left it ! what the hell are you doing ? ! hurry up !

mikey loves his birthday present .
where is he ?
it is three feet deep , martin
michael ! come inside !
it is his birthday present , and you closed the beach , honey . i told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday . i do not believe he will ever do it again .
how come you have to tell them that ?
you too , sweetheart . . .
why do not we have one more drink , you and i , and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure that is inside him , or not .
can you do that ?
home . . . new york ?
colorful , is not he ?
you going to be all right ?
nothing to worry about i will survive this .
yo ho ho and a bottle of rum .
what will i tell the kids ?
martin ! are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority ?
now tell me something i do not know .
all i am saying is that amity is a summer town we need summer dollars , and if they cannot swim here , they will use the beaches at cape cod , or long island .
i do not think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things .
i cannot work in a vacuum . why do not you make hendricks chief ? his family s been here since the puritans half this island are his cousins .
i will get to that in a minute . first , i plan to start our seasonal summer help early , and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea . i would like cooperation from local fishermen , and i have also contacted the oceanographic institute over on the mainland .
only hours !
larry , if you would see these clowns leave , you would never believe they would come back with anything . but they got him !
that is good . that is real good . ben meadows getting pictures for the paper .
who s that young man ?
matt hooper , the specialist they send down from the oceanographic institute .
why not , larry ? we could get a positive confirmation that way .
she is right .
let s all get out of here , this place stinks .
he lost it on the way up .
we have got to close the beaches . we have got to get someone to kill the shark , we need non corrosive mesh netting , we need scientific support . . . it is gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have .
you would love to prove that . getting your name in the national geographic .
larry , we can re open the beaches in august .
got a pen on you ?
why ?
there s only one thing you are good for anymore signing a damn voucher . here . it is an authorization to employ a contractor .
i do not know if i can do that without a . . .
i am going to hire quint to kill the fish . i want to see that shark dead .
maybe we can save august . . .
forget it . this summer s had it . next summer s had it . you are the mayor of shark city . you wanted to keep the beaches open . what happens when the town finds out about that ?
i was acting in the towngs best interests . . .
the best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly up in the water with a hole in his head . you do the right thing . you authorize me . right there . whatever it costs .
my kids were on that beach . . .
there s a fantail launch out there that will not make it beyond the breakwater .
you are telling me . i swear , this town has gone crazy .
officer , i wonder if you could tell me where i could find chief brody ?
who are you ?
. . . height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains . torso severed in mid thorax , eviscerated with no major organs remaining . may i have a drink of water ? right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature . portions of denuded bone remaining . did you notify the coast guard ?
no , it was local jurisdiction .
left arm , head , shoulders , sternum and portions of ribcage intact . please do not smoke . with minor post mortem lacerations and abrasions . bite marks indicate typical non frenzy feeding pattern of large squali , possibly carchaninus lonimanus , or isurus glaucas . gross tissue loss and post mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis however , teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters . did you go out in a boat and look around ?
no , we just checked the beach . . .
well , if one man can catch a fish in days , then i guess of these bozos can catch a fish in one day beginner s luck .
i did not say this was not the shark , i just said i was not sure this was the one . . .
what d ya mean ?
dynamite ! how was your day . . . ?
we ought to let it breathe . . . whatever .
drowning . lemme ask you something . is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water , around feet from the beach ?
yeah . like the kid on your beach . i wish i could have examined that shark they caught . . .
something else . do most attacks go unreported ?
about half of them . a lot of missing swimmers are really shark victims .
there s a kind of a lone shark , called , uh . . .
rogue ?
yeah . rogue . picks out an area where there s food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts ?
it is called territoriality . it is a theory .
and before , when people first starting swimming for recreation , before public bathing and resorts , there were very few shark attacks , cause sharks did not know what they were missing ?
. . . and it was dartmouth winter weekend , and she was homecoming queen , and i was her date then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family , and she was right her great grandfather was in mining , and my ancestors were yankee shipbuilders . so we broke up and i went home with some beatnik from sarah lawrence .
what stinks so bad ?
that is that ?
half a flounder . hmmm . . . a burlap bag . . . a paint can . . . aha !
what ? what ? !
just as i thought . he drifted up here with the gulf stream , from southern waters .
how can you tell ?
florida license plate .
he ate a car ?
. . . nothing .
what do we do ?
if you are looking for a shark , you do not look on land . you go out and chum for him .
chum ?
what is all this stuff ?
depth finder , fathometer , sonar , closed circuit tv fore and aft rdf , single side band . . . and two loose nuts behind the wheel .
can you tell from that if a big man eater is around ?
where would you get all this ?
i bought it . both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me stocks went up , so i do not have to touch my principal .
you are at the institute full time ? or do you have a job ?
it is a job . i am not fooling around like some amateur . it is my life !
what happened ?
do not they have lifejackets or something ? an extra boat ?
he did not have a dinghy aboard . i am going down to take a look at his hull .
why do not we just tow it in ?
we will . there s something i have got to find out .
you all right ?
a white ! a great white , i found a tooth buried in the hull . he must have attacked . . . i knew it . . . gardner s dead in there . i did not see the mate . . .
there is a kind of shark called a great white shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater .
you are situation here suggests that a great white has staked out a claim in the waters around amity island , and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water .
there s no limits to where he can strike , and we have had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days . it happened like this before , in , when a great white killed five swimmers at jones beach , in long island .
a shark s attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming you cannot avoid it !
a th of july beach is like ringing a dinner bell , for chrissake !
i just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there .
i am familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass ! there are only two ways to solve this thing you can kill it , or you can cut off its food supply . . .
wait a minute ! i need you .
i hope we get some more help .
this has got to be one big violation . . .
that is that , a ship ?
what the hell ?
do not shoot him any more ! he is crazy on his own blood already !
quint . . . ?
what day is this ?
wednesday . . . no , it is tuesday , i think .
think the tide s with us ?
just keep kicking .
y know , i used to hate the water . . .
christine what ?
worthingsly . . . worthington no one ever died on me before .
you picked her up on the ferry .
i did not know her .
and nobody else saw her in the water ?
somebody could have i was sort of passed out .
think she might have run out on you ?
oh , no , sir . i have never had a woman do that . i am sure she drowned .
you from around here ?
no . cambridge . harvard . my family s in tuxedo , new york , though .
you here for the summer ?
some friends and me took a house .
what d you pay for a place just for the summer ?
a thousand apiece , something like that . there s five of us . and we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning , stuff like that .
where would you hide the beach closed signs ?
polly told me to tell you there s a scout troop in avril bay doing the mile swim for their merit badges . i could not call them in , there s no phone out there .
get out of there take these back to the office and make up some beach closed signs , and let polly do the printing .
. . . so then denherder and charlie sat there trying to catch their breath , and figuring out how to explain to charlie s wife what happened to her freezer full of meat .
mrs . kintner must have put her ad in field and stream .
we are not even sure what it was .
. . . and bill mayhew almost caught him in his net . . . ?
look , i have got to talk to her . this is not a contest we want the whole country entering .
i agree . if she is going to advertise , i would not recommend out of town papers . amity people could take care of this .
i would like to tell you what we are doing so far . these are some of the steps i have taken as chief of police . . .
you wanna call it a night after here ?
it is only two thirty . what , are you tired ?
leg of lamb this time ?
screw lamb let s shoot the sirloin !
one more after this , then i am going home .
you do this all the time , right , charlie ?
twenty years .
look at him take it !
do i set the goddam hook ?
hi . i am matt hooper . if your husband is here , i would like to talk to him .
would you like something ? some coffee ?
my husband tells me you are in sharks .
i would not put it that way . but i love sharks .
you love sharks ?
here s to your husband , the only other rational man on the island . day after tomorrow , i will be gone , and he will be the only one .
you are leaving ?
going out on the aurora .
is that a boat ?
is it ! the best funded research expedition to ever study the shark . . . around the world in months .
like those cousteau specials on television ? i think it is for the kids , but i love them .
better than cousteau , or compagno with computers , telemetry , defense department funding . . .
i saw a show with sea otters , and a big turtle . . . mikey loved it . made me promise to get him one . will you live on the boat ?
yep .
. . . push this ? oh . it is working . hello , martin ?
this is quint , missus .
i just wanted to know if you were all right . . . the coast guard let me use their radio . is chief brody there ?
he is busy .
well . . . is everything all right ?
what have you got there , lenny ?
who have you told this to , lenny ?
i just found out about it but there s a bunch of boy scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl . avril bay , thereabouts . chief went to dry them off .
take my car , okay ? you come with us , lenny .
i have got all these signs here . . .
i have been to sea since i was . i have crewed three trans pacs
transplants ?
and an america s cup trials . . .
i am not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating . i am talking about working for a living . sharking .
and i am not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark . i am talking about a great white .
i do not need to pass basic seamanship .
ha . city hands . you been counting money . if you had a net and worth of fish in it , and along comes mr . white , and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls . if you would ever worked for a living , you would know what that means .
hey , squirt ! you want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast ? it ai not good for much but bait .
hello , junior . what are you ? some kind of half assed astronaut ? jesus christ , when i was a kid , every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman . what d ya have there a portable shower ?
anti shark cage .
that is that supposed to prove ?
nothing . nothing , nothing , nothing .
watch it ! compressed air you screw around with one of those and boom ! careful , huh ?
that is pilot whale , is not it ?
hey , you ! farmer ! half speed there . . .
getting ready to run again no ? no ? that is he playing here ? put the gloves on ! let s see who s gonna tease who now !
let it go , do not waste your time .
i do not know what it is , but it is not a shark .
a marlin , or a stingray . huh . do not ever tell me my business again . get back up on the bridge .
i am okay . . .
over there !
what do you see ?
feet , if it is an inch . . .
wire burn . trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off .
face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room . this love line here . . . . . . that is from some crazy frenchie come after me with a knife . i caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas .
bull shark scraped me while i was taking samples . . .
i will drink to your leg .
. . . mako . fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck . you do not get bitten by one of those bastards but twice your first and your last .
do not tell me wouldeath before dishonor . mother . semper fi . uhhh . . . wouldo not tread on me . c mon what ?
easy ! it will tear right out !
coming right to us !
he is heading under !
follow him !
what can that gun of yours do ?
that is disgusting ! this is the largest , meanest , most vicious shark ever landed off amity island , and a known maneater !
i am sorry , martin . she is in a sick , terrible state .
is that tooth here ? did anyone see it ?
carcaradon carcharias . a great white .
sick vandalism ! brody , that is a deliberate mutilation of a public service message ! i want those little paint happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby buster browns !
paul ? are you coming downstairs to eat ?
i do not think so .
you ran eight miles today , puppy .
i am not hungry , oddly .
juno macguff called while you were out running . she wants to know if you are coming to her little coffeehouse performance on saturday .
thanks for the message .
you know how i feel about her .
you have mentioned it about fifty times .
hey bleek .
hey , cool tiger . looks proud .
yeah , i swiped it from ms . rancick .
cool .
your shorts are looking especially gold today .
my mom uses color safe bleach .
go carole . so , guess what ?
i do not know . . .
when i see them all running like that , with their things bouncing around in their shorts , i always picture them naked , even if i do not want to . i have intrusive thoughts all the time .
i am supposed to be running .
so , what do you think we should do ?
i thought i might , you know , nip it in the bud before it gets worse . because i heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant .
yeah , typically . that is what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant .
so that is cool with you , then ?
yeah , wizard , i guess . i mean do what you think is right .
i am real sorry i had sex with you . i know it was not your idea .
whose idea was it ?
well ! nothing like experimenting .
oh , i could not copy your work .
but you copy my work every week .
oh yeah . i am kind of a deadbeat lab partner , huh ?
i do not mind . you definitely bring something to the table .
charisma ?
hey juno . . . a couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids .
sorry , bleek . . . going for my ultrasound . gotta note and everything .
okay , cool .
that is up ?
i just wanted to come over . you know , say hi . i miss hanging out with you on school nights .
so , it looks like you are getting pregnant er these days .
really ? what are they like ?
the guy is super cool ! his name is mark and he is into old horror movies and he plays guitar . i actually hung out with him today .
is that normal ?
i asked my dad and bren not to narc us out to your folks , so we should be safe .
i am going to really start looking like a dork soon . will you still think i am cute if i am huge ?
jesus , bleek .
hey junebug , when all this is over we should get the band back together again .
yeah . sure . once tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go .
we could get back together too .
well , we were once . you know , that time .
what about katrina de voort ? you could go out with katrina de voort .
i do not like katrina .
i totally heard you did .
are you honestly and truly going to prom with katrina de voort ?
um , hi ?
leah just told me you were going with her .
we are getting a stretch limo .
your mom must be really glad you are not taking me .
you are mad . why are you mad ?
i am not mad . i am in a fucking great mood . despite the fact that i am trapped in a fat suit i cannot take off , despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back , despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday . . .
you are being really immature .
that is not how our thing works ! i hurl the accusations and you talk me down , remember ?
not this time . you do not have any reason to be mad at me . you broke my heart . i should be royally ticked at you , man . i should be really cheesed off . i should not want to talk to you anymore .
why ? because i got bored and had sex with you one day , and then i did not , like , marry you ?
like i would marry you ! you would be the meanest wife of all time . and anyway , i know you were not bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on tv . the blair witch project was on starz , and you were like , oh , i want to watch this , but we should make out instead . la la la .
forget it , bleek . take katrina the douche packer to the prom . i am sure you guys will have a really bitching time !
yeah , well . . . i still have your underwear .
i still have your virginity !
oh my god , shut up !
what ? are you ashamed that we did it ?
no . . .
wait , let me take that .
huh ?
you should not be carrying that heavy bag . i will take it .
did you put like a hundred things of tic tacs in my mailbox ?
yeah . that was me .
why ?
because they are your fave . and you can never have too much of your favorite one calorie breath mint .
well . . . thanks . i think i am pretty much set until college on the tic tac front .
you know , i have been thinking . i am really sorry i was such a huge bitch to you . you did not deserve that . you never deserve any of the poo i unload on you .
you know it is okay .
also , i think i am in love with you .
what , you mean as friends ?
no , for real . i think you are the coolest person i have ever met . and you do not even have to try .
i try really hard , actually . . .
no , you are naturally smart . you always think of the funniest things to do . remember when you passed me that postcard during spanish class , and it was addressed like , junebug macguff , row , third seat from the blackboard ? and it said , i am having fun in barcelona wish you were here ? that was hilarious .
i was just bored . i only think school is awesome like , of the time .
plus , you are the only person who does not stare at my stomach all the fucking time . you actually look at my face . and every time i look at you , the baby starts kicking me super hard .
wizard !
i think it is because my heart starts pounding when i see you .
mine too .
basically , i am completely smitten with you , and i do not care if i am making an ass out of myself right now , because you have seen me make an ass out of myself a million times , and you still want to be my friend .
well , yeah . you are the best friend i have ever had , even when you are being kind of evil .
that is all i need from you . that is more than i could ever ask for . you are just golden , dude .
can we make out now ?
you are a part time lover and a fulltime friend . the monkey on your back is the latest trend . i do not see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .
here is the church and here is the steeple . we sure are cute for two ugly people . i do not see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .
we both have shiny happy fits of rage . you want more fans , i want more stage . i do not see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .
you are always trying to keep it real . i am in love with how you feel . i do not see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .
i kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train . i kiss you all starryeyed , my body s swinging from side to side . i do not see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .
hey man .
oh , hey vijay .
did you hear juno macguff is pregnant ?
yup .
just like our moms and teachers !
yup .
did you hear it is yours ?
yup .
what a trip , man .
i do not really know anything about it .
you should grow a moustache . you are a real man now .
i cannot grow a moustache . it never comes in evenly .
what ? i am not made of stone .
wait , that is that supposed to mean ?
they could be utterly negligent . maybe they will do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would . have you considered that ?
no . . . i guess not .
what is your job title , exactly ?
excuse me ?
i said , what is your job title , missy ?
i am an ultrasound technician , ma am .
well i am a nail technician , and i think we both ought to stick to what we know .
what are you talking about ?
nails ? really ?
just tell it to me straight , bren . do you think this is my fault ? her mother s fault ?
i think kids get bored and have intercourse . and i think junebug was a dummy about it . but we have to move on from here and help her figure it out .
i am not ready to be a pop pop .
you are not going to be a pop pop . and juno s not going to be a ma . somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from jesus in this garbage dump of a situation . i frigging hope .
did you see it coming when she sat us down here ?
oh god yeah . but i was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs .
that was my first instinct too . or d . w . i . anything but this . and i am going to punch that bleeker kid in the weiner the next time i see him .
juno ? did you happen to barf in my urn ? mac , you know that nice urn by the front door , the one i got up in stillwater ? i found some weird blue shit , i mean stuff , gunk , in there this morning .
i have no idea how to spit this out .
hon , did you get expelled ?
no . the school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion .
oh , god . . .
but they have a real lawyer and everything . i am going to meet with them next weekend .
junebug , that is a tough , tough thing to do . probably tougher than you can understand right now .
no .
well , you are a brave young lady . you are made of stronger stuff than i thought . you are a little viking !
cool it .
first things first , we have to get you healthy . you need prenatal vitamins . incidentally , they will do incredible things for your nails , so that is a plus . oh , and we need to schedule a doctor s appointment . find out where you are going to deliver .
where the hell have you been , junebug ?
i drove to st . cloud to show mark and vanessa the ultrasound . and i wound up staying for a couple of hours .
a couple of hours ? why are you going up there in the first place ?
they said they wanted to know about this stuff . they said to keep them updated , so i did !
you could have sent it to them . why would you drive an hour out to east jesus , nowhere ?
that was a mistake , juno . mark is a married stranger . you overstepped a boundary .
listen , bren duhhh , i think you are the one overstepping boundaries . you are acting like you are the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else . besides , who cares if he is married ? i can have friends who are married .
it does not work that way , kiddo . you do not know squat about the dynamics of marriage .
you do not know anything about me !
we do not even have a dog !
yeah , because you are allergic to their saliva . i have made a lot of sacrifices for you , juno . and in a couple years you are going to move out and i am getting weimaraners .
wow , dream big !
ow , ow , fuckity ow . bren , when do i get that spinal tap thing ?
it is called a spinal block , and you cannot have it yet , honey . the doctor said you are not dilated enough .
you mean i have to wait for it to get even worse ? why cannot they just give it to me now ?
shit . hey , can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already ?
so , juno . first off , how far along are you ?
i am a junior .
no , i mean in your pregnancy .
yeah . yeah ! the way people used to do it . quick and dirty , like ripping off a band aid .
well , then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved , then ?
amanda , i told you to go to the infirmary and lie down . you never listen .
no josh , i do not take orders . not from you and not from any man .
you know , you have been acting like this ever since i went up to see my brother at mankato . i told you , nothing happened !
something happened . because your eyes ? are very cold ? they are very cold , josh . they are cold , lying eyes .
what ? my eyes are not lying !
good . call me when you are off the rag .
fine . call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother s college just because you had four smirnoff ices and a bottle of snow peak peach flavored boone s !
this is our attorney , gerta rauss .
no .
so , let s discuss how we are gonna do this . . . thing .
whoah . i do not want to see pictures . i do not need to be notified of anything . cannot we just kick it old school ? i could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way . you know , like moses in the reeds .
whoops ! yikes , i did not expect to see you up here .
sorry . i was just getting something .
did your wife send you up here to spy on me ?
what ? no ! do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something ?
well , you do not just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised . i could be a total klepto , for all you know .
i do not get a klepto vibe from you . evil genius ? maybe . arsonist ? would not rule it out .
am i supposed to feel happy now ?
you should be happy , holmes . i am giving you and vanessa the gift of life . sweet , screaming , pooping life ! and you do not even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in . . .
viscera ?
blood and guts .
oh . that is , uh , my room . vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff .
wow , you get a whole room in your own house ? she is got you on a long leash there , mark .
it is beautiful . i have always liked gibson better than fender .
what do you play ?
i rock a harmony .
oh .
what ? i am a pawn shop rocker .
what is that , mahogany ? what happens if you crack the neck ?
tell me about it . i used to play in a really tight band back when i lived in chicago , and one night we opened for the melvins . . . do you know who the melvins are ?
yeah .
well , we were playing with them and i busted this guitar onstage . it cost me and a dime bag just to have it fixed .
when was this , like ?
. i am telling you that was the best time for rock and roll .
nuh uh , ! punk volume . you were not there , so you cannot understand the magic .
your guitar is named kimber ?
yeah .
juno ? wow , i did not expect to see you here .
i have got something really cool to show you guys . is vanessa here ?
right . i hear they can be kind of a time suck .
come on in . you wanna ginseng cooler ?
sure . what is it with you rich people and your herb infused juices ?
why are not you at work ?
i mostly work from home . i am a composer .
no shit . like johannes brahms ?
no , more commercial stuff .
like what ?
commercials .
oh .
have you seen those ads for titanium power mengs deodorant ?
titanium power ! get more snatch by the batch !
i wrote that .
you are kind of a sellout , are not you ? what would the melvins say ?
behold , good sir ! the very first photo of your future child .
i think it kind of looks like my friend , paulie .
oh , is he bald and amorphous ?
can you tell if it is a boy or a girl ?
the doctor can tell , but i decided not to know . i want it to be a big surprise .
well , it can really only go two ways .
that is what you think . i drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter babies that is born without junk .
junk ?
you know . . . it is parts . . .
i know what junk is .
yeah ?
we definitely want it to have junk .
what is it ?
it is only my favorite song . it is sonic youth doing superstar by the carpenters .
i have heard the carpenters before . chick drummer and freaky dude . not unlike the white stripes .
do not you remember you told me you loved me , baby . . .
hey , i like this .
this album is all carpenters covers by alt rock bands . it is called if i were a carpenter . it is god . i will rip a copy for you before you leave .
you do not have to do that .
it is the least i can do . what did you say your favorite band was ?
i did not . but it is a three way tie between the stooges , patti smith and the runaways .
the wizard of gore ?
oh yeah . it is herschel gordon lewis . he is the ultimate master of horror .
argento s good , but lewis is completely demented . we are talking buckets of goo . red corn syrup everywhere . and fake brains up the yin yang .
this is even better than suspiria . you have got decent taste in slasher movies , mark .
so , have you and vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet ?
well , sort of . vanessa likes madison for a girl .
madison ? is not that kind of . . . i do not know , gay ?
god , pretentious much ? i guess everyone should have a mysterious name like juno , huh ?
my dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with greek and roman mythology . he named me after zeus s wife . i mean , zeus had other lays , but i am pretty sure juno was his only wife . she was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean . like diana ross .
that suits you .
uh , thanks .
you know , not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this .
i weighed my options . but after all this , i am glad i did not , you know , get rid of it . i want to have it . for you guys .
vanessa . shit , you better get out of here .
why ? what the big deal ?
nothing . she just hates when i sit around watching movies and not contributing .
juno was nice enough to bring this by for us .
hey , what kind of swag did you score ?
i doubt anyone s throwing us a shower .
cold feet .
hello ?
oh really ? that is the verdict ?
i sort of like it . i mean , it is cute .
cute ?
well , when you are used to the raw power of iggy and the stooges , everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison .
i imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point .
consider it your musical education .
i am dying to see what you have got to teach me .
okay , stop surfing porn and get back to work . just wanted to say hi .
wow . that shirt is working hard .
is vanessa here ?
cool .
oh , mark ! is this the baby s room ? it is beautiful !
hilarious . no , i just keep all of my old comics down here , and i want to show you one of them .
oh god , you are one of those guys . . .
most fruitful yuki ? what is . . . oh my god , she is a pregnant superhero !
wow , i actually feel like less of a fat dork now .
what ?
i actually know this one .
you do ?
yeah , this song s older than me , if you can believe that . i danced to it at my senior prom .
that is almost interesting , mark . who did you dance with ?
her name was cynthia vogel and she was a good dance partner . even let me put my hands on her butt .
oh , okay . like this .
you have never been to a dance , have you ?
only squares and nerds go to dances .
what are you ?
i am leaving vanessa .
what ?
no .
no ?
no . no , you definitely cannot do that , mark . that is a big , fat sack of no !
that is the matter ?
but i thought you would be cool if . . .
i want you guys to adopt the buglet . i wanted everything to be perfect . not shitty and broken like everyone else s family . listen , once i have the baby , vanessa is going to finally be happy , and everything will be all right . believe me on this one !
a baby is not going to fix everything . besides , i do not know if i am ready to be a father .
but you are old !
i . . . how do you think of me , juno ? why are you here ?
i do not know . i just liked being your friend . i sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life .
this . . . . . . this is what my life has become . stuff in boxes . stuff underground . is that so appealing to you ?
yeah , i guess . . . is this my fault ? is vanessa mad at you because of me ?
that is not the point . we are just not in love anymore .
please do not get a divorce ! god , mark , just do me a solid and stay with your wife .
god , you are so young .
uh , hi su chin .
oh , hi juno . how are you ?
good . i am good . did you finish that paper for worth s class yet ?
no , not yet . i tried to work on it a little last night , but i am having trouble concentrating .
you should try adderall .
no thanks . i am off pills .
wise move . i know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once . she took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at ridgedale mall and she was like , blaaaaah ! i am a kraken from the sea !
i heard that was you .
juno ! your baby probably has a beating heart , you know . it can feel pain . and it has fingernails .
hi ! i am vanessa . you must be juno and mr . macguff . i am vanessa .
can i take your coats ?
wicked pic in the penny saver , by the way . super classy . not like those other people with the fake woods in the background . like i am really going to fall for that , you know ?
i will get drinks . what would everyone like ? i have got pellegrino , vitamin water . . .
oh , that is marvelous . so you are almost into your second trimester , then ?
yeah , apparently . i am having it on may .
the tough part s almost over for you . i mean , my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest .
yeah , but i hardly noticed it . i am more worried about the part where i have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front .
i think pregnancy is beautiful .
well , shall we start looking over the paperwork ? gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents .
can i use the facilities first ? being pregnant makes you pee like seabiscuit .
sure . the powder room down here is being re tiled , but you can use the master bath upstairs . go up , then turn left and on your right . . .
oh . sure . of course you would want to know how your kid is cooking .
i am going to say i am sure .
oh really ?
juno ! god , you startled me . what are you doing here ? that is wrong ?
nothing . . .
then that is going on ?
is the baby okay ?
what . . .
oh my god . . .
does not it look like it is waving ? it is kind of like it is saying hi , vanessa . will you be my mommy ?
oh it is just some stuff i picked up . for , you know , the baby . babies need a lot of things . i want everything to be just right .
um , i think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it is not , you know , set in stone .
what do you mean ? you mean . . . do you think i am going to flake out on you ?
right . well , juno , your parents must be wondering where you are . you might want to head home .
well hi vanessa ! what brings you to the mall today ?
no . . .
please excuse leah . she is mentally challenged .
oh , okay . so . . . how are you feeling ?
um . . . juno , can i can i touch it ?
oh my god it moved ! i felt it !
elbow .
juno ? that is going on ?
mark ? why is juno crying ?
hi . i am here for the big show ?
your name , please ?
would you like some free condoms ? they are boysenberry .
no thank you . i am off sex .
my partner uses these every time we have intercourse . they make his balls smell like pie .
you should have seen this octopus furnace . i had to get out my hazmat suit just to get up in there . . .
so juno , how did your maneuver go last night ?
do you need a large sum of money ? legal counsel ?
no , no , i am definitely not asking for anything . except maybe mercy . like , it would be really great if nobody hit me .
they say they are going to pay my medical expenses and everything . i promise this will all be resolved in thirty odd weeks , and we can pretend it never happened .
you are pregnant ?
who is the kid ?
what ?
okay , this is no laughing matter .
did you say you were thinking about adoption ?
damn skippy , you are not ! you do not even remember to give liberty bell her breathing meds .
i thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when .
she is joking . junebug has a wonderful sense of humor , which is just one of her many genetic gifts .
excuse me ?
hi dad .
hey , big puffy version of junebug . where have you been ?
dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level . where is everyone ?
bren took liberty bell to her tot ice skating class .
tot ice skating ? tots cannot ice skate . liberty bell s still getting the hang of stairs .
no , but you know bren . she dreams big .
yeah , she does .
you look a little morose , honey . that is eating you ?
i am losing my faith in humanity .
think you can narrow it down for me .
i guess i wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good .
you mean like couples ?
yeah , like people in love .
are you having boy trouble ? i gotta be honest i do not much approve of you dating in your condition , cause . . . well , that is kind of messed up .
dad , no !
well , it is kind of skanky . is not that what you girls call it ? skanky ? skeevy ?
please stop now .
tore up from the floor up ?
dad , it is not about that . i just need to know that it is possible for two people to stay happy together forever . or at least for a few years .
i sort of already have .
what ? !
either i just pissed my pants or . . .
or . . .
well , well . if it is not macguff the crime dog ! back for another test ?
maybe you are having twins . maybe your little boyfriend s got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice !
well , you know where the lavatory is . you pay for that pee stick when you are done ! do not think it is yours just because you have marked it with your urine !
jesus , i did not say it was .
so that is the prognosis , fertile myrtle ? minus or plus ?
yo yo yiggity yo .
i am a suicide risk .
is this juno ?
no it is morgan freeman . got any bones that need collecting ?
only the one in my pants .
dude , i am pregnant .
maybe it is just a food baby . did you have a big lunch ?
it is not a food baby . i took three pregnancy tests today . i am definitely up the spout .
how did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests ?
i drank like ten tons of sunny delight . anyway , yeah . i am pregnant . and you are shockingly cavalier .
is this for real ? like for real , for real ?
unfortunately , yes .
oh my god ! oh shit ! phuket thailand !
that is the kind of emotion i was looking for in the first take .
well , are you going to go to havenbrooke or women now for the abortion ? you need a note from your parents for havenbrooke .
i know . women now , i guess . the commercial says they help women now .
want me to call for you ? i called for becky last year .
heavy lifting can only help you at this point .
so , you were bored ? is that how this blessed miracle came to be ?
nah , it was a premeditated act . the sex , i mean , not getting pregnant .
when did you decide you were going to do bleeker ?
aha ! you love him .
so , what was it like humping bleeker s bony bod ?
what are you doing here , dumbass ? i thought i was supposed to pick you up at four .
i could not do it , leah ! it smelled like a dentist in there . they had these really horrible magazines , with , like , spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains , like someone read them in the tub . and the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers , and she told me about her boyfriend s pie balls , and su chin kuah was there , and she told me the baby had fingernails . fingernails !
oh , gruesome . i wonder if the baby s claws could scratch your vag on the way out ?
i am staying pregnant , le .
keep your voice down dude , my mom s around here somewhere . she does not know we are sexually active .
what does that even mean ? anyway , i got to thinking on the way over . i was thinking maybe i could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing . you know , like a woman with a bum ovary or something . or some nice lesbos .
but then you will get huge . your chest is going to milktate . and you have to tell everyone you are pregnant .
i know . maybe they will canonize me for being so selfless .
maybe they will totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to cabo san lucas for spring break .
well , maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads . i see them all the time in the penny saver .
there are ads ? for parents ?
oh yeah ! desperately seeking spawn . they are right by the ads for like , iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment . it is totally legit .
the penny saver sucks .
look at this one wholesome , spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other . all that is missing is your bastard .
there s a guy in here who s giving away a piano . free for the hauling ! we should put it in bleeker s yard .
you are not listening to me .
no , i heard you . i just cannot give the baby to people who describe themselves as wholesome . i am looking for something a little edgier .
what did you have in mind , a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest ?
i was thinking a graphic designer , mid thirties , and his cool asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass . but i am trying to not be too particular .
all right , how about this one ? healthy , educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five . you will be compensated . help us complete the circle of love .
yeesh , they sound like a cult . besides , they are greedy bitches . they already have three kids !
best to just tell them , man . rip off the band aid and let it bleed .
check out baby big head . that kid is scary !
hey , i am a sacred vessel . all you have got in your belly is taco bell !
touche .
aw , please junebug ?
how do you know i am so poisonous ? like , what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters ?
yum . this pretzel tastes like a frigging donut !
hly shht !
that is her . that is vanessa loring .
no way ! she is pretty .
you sound shocked or something .
she is gonna steal that kid for her collection .
i want a huge cookie . and like , a lamb kebob . simultaneously .
god , you are getting huge . how many months has it been now ?
almost eight . you would not believe how weird i look naked .
i wish my funbags would get bigger .
trust me , you do not . i actually have to wear a bra now . and i have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode .
god , why is everyone always staring at me ?
wow , someone s been actually doing her geometry homework for once !
i do not have a choice . keith s been grading me really hard lately .
please do not refer to mr . conyers as keith , okay ? my barf reflex is already heightened these days .
keith s hot .
did you hear bleek is going to prom with katrina de voort ?
katrina ? pfft , no way . he does not like katrina . it must be a pity date .
he asked her . i heard they were going to benihana , then the prom , then to vijay s parents cabin .
bleeker told me katrina s whole house reeks of soup !
oh , it totally does . i was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like lipton landing . but you know , boys have endured worse things for nookie .
there s no way in hell they are having sex or even holding hands .
i would not be so sure about that . he did it with you . he is a man now .
yeah , well , bleek trusted me . we are best friends .
are you jealous ? i thought you said you did not care what he did .
i am not jealous , and i do not care . i just know he does not like katrina and i do not think he should toy with her emotions like that . she seems so nice and all .
okay juno , i am really convinced .
hello . thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home .
you do not say .
well , have not you ever felt like you were born to do something ?
yes . heating and air conditioning .
so . that is that thing ?
a pilates machine ?
what do you make with that ?
obviously , we will compensate you for your medical expenses .
you are doing an amazing and selfless thing for us .
vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married .
you guys are playing music ?
what do you think ? custard or cheesecake ?
they are yellow .
well , i wanted to pick something gender neutral for now . once we get the baby , god willing , we can create a more decisive palette .
why do people think yellow is gender neutral ? i do not know one man with a yellow bedroom .
i think i am leaning toward custard in this light . i do not know . i should paint a small area . . .
or you could just wait a couple months . it is not like the baby s going to storm in here any second and demand dessert colored walls .
what to expect says that readying the baby s room is an important process for women . it is called nesting .
nesting , huh ? are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva ?
you should read the book . i even flagged the daddy chapters for you .
i just think it is too early to paint . that is my opinion .
that wall is going to need something . maybe we could put our first family picture there .
hm .
juno , that is the matter ?
what did you do ?
i did not do anything . . . i just . . . i have just been thinking .
what ?
just thinking if this is really the right thing for us .
i have been just wondering if we are , you know , ready .
of course we are ready . we have taken all the classes . the nursery . the books
why do not we let juno go home and we can discuss this later on , okay ?
it all just happened so fast . we put that ad in the paper . i thought it would take months if , you know , ever and then boom two weeks later , she is in our living room .
she answered our prayers .
what would be a good time for you ?
i do not know . there s just things i still want to do .
like what ? be a rock star ?
i called gerta rauss . she says she can represent both of us . they call it collaborative divorce . it is apparently all the rage right now . and it is easy because we do not have children .
we are actually , finally doing this ?
looks like it , yeah .
have you found a place to stay ?
yeah , downtown .
a hotel ?
it is a loft .
no .
you lose !
. . . you can forget about em forever and then look at em and they are doing even better than before .
. . . there ai not nothing can kill em . they can live for two even three hundred years .
adele for god sake please lis . . .
hi , i am adele .
. . . pardon ?
. . . i said , i like your hair .
one night we figured out how much bad luck he must have coming from all them mirrors he broke . . . four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off . . . after he dies , he will have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over . . .
what ?
karma . . . you know , if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you .
are you taking the pictures ?
. . . yeah .
is it hard to learn ?
you would not have any color film , would ya ?
you dropped this .
early do not think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor .
better not , or early would whip me .
. . . hey you are good . thought you said you never played before ?
i told you how early feels about a woman drinking .
you know i can fix that haircut for you , if you want ?
i am cool .
that is this ?
it is a portfolio of my work .
your pictures . can i see em ?
you took this picture ?
that is me .
no it is not !
hold still .
you should not let him do that to you . . .
do what ?
adele . . . are you serious ?
you think early s bad to me , do not you ?
my momma s a beautician . guess that is where i get it from . she would not hear of my moving in with early . . . on account of his just getting out of jail and all . ai not seen her in nearly a year now . i wish she would call me , just once .
that is early been in jail for ?
carrying a gun .
. . . anything else ?
ang resisting arrest . . . at least that is what the police said .
the police are after him , he is a murderer !
. . . that is not true .
what ?
. . . i would not lie to you , adele . . . i saw him kill that man .
happy birthday adele .
i feel kind of like the wizard of oz , you know when she gets the red shoes .
that is up adele ? dinner ready ?
well . . . for one thing . . . they think faster out there , on account of all that warm weather they got cold weather makes people stupid , that is a fact .
i guess that would explain why there s so many stupid people around here .
yeah , and in california you never have to buy fruit cause it is all on the trees everywhere you turn . . . . . . and , course there ai not no speed limit out there , and all drugs are legal . . . and i heard your first month s rent is free state law . i figure til we get settled we can just move around month to month . . .
what will we do out there ?
you know . . . i read once . . . ai not nothing on that big old moon cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind .
do not be long now , dinner s about ready .
what if they are dangerous ?
did you settle things with mr . diebold ?
geez , they look kinda weird .
you just smile , let me do all the talking .
how many times you gonna tell me that ?
shush , adele .
can you believe thirty bucks for this room . . . for what ? a lumpy mattress , that crummy tv and a crapper .
early , what are you doing ?
what the hell is this stuff ?
yeah but , what is it ?
. . . thank you .
thank you for what ? what are you thanking me for adele ?
. . . i do not know .
that is wrong with her ?
nobody wants to hurt you peaches !
oh , ngjus what in hell you crying about ? i am the one got hit .
that is your name , boy ?
walter livesy .
think . i might just have to kill you walter . how do you feel about that ?
not so good . you sure you have to ?
where you from walter ?
vernon , florida .
never heard of it , any hunting ?
turkey mostly .
. . . mind if i hold that bible ?
you think i am going to kill you . well that would make me a liar then would not it ?
tight fit .
uh , we can stop somewhere if you and adele have not had time for breakfast , early .
well , it is like this , mr . kessler .
brian .
so what do you do early ?
you gonna talk to the people who did those murders ?
that is a good idea . unfortunately most of them have been executed .
cannot hurt .
how much do i owe you ?
this the book your writing ?
it is just a work in progress , kinda rough .
this guy killed a mess of people .
who ?
henry lucas .
henry lee lucas . well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred .
how did he get away with it for so long anyhow ?
that bad ?
. . . they never caught that black dolya killer , huh ?
dahlia , no .
now why is that ?
some people think it is because he never killed again . he just disappeared back into society .
you do not sound too convinced about that ?
i always thought it was the work of a serial killer . anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again . and again . until someone stopped him .
that your . . . theory , ai not that what they call it ?
yeah .
sure .
by the way , i am not much of a pool player .
shit , it ai not hard to play pool . i can teach you everything ya need ta know .
yeah ?
hell yeah ! i will even spot ya a few points first game .
wait a minute . you are gonna hustle me ?
. . . well i probably drunk more than my share , anyway . . . you go on ang have it .
. . . well then , that is how many i killed .
if you say so .
ya see what i am saying ? ha !
hey . . . ai not we getting near the next murder site . . . bri ?
forget about it , does not matter .
so tell me . . . what happened here ?
. . . and ?
you two been busy in here .
what happened to adele ?
executing the killer would not bring my mother back .
okay , now you want to talk about good versus evil ? well then let s start with adam and eve and the snake .
who do i have to blow to get out of here ?
tonight turned out to be pretty interesting .
the warehouse . i am not that drunk .
just being there where it really happened . it was different . . . more visceral .
i thought you wanted to be a writer .
. . . i do .
then you can write anywhere . let s get out of here , while we still can .
carrie , come on . . . we can leave anytime we . . .
no we cannot . we can never leave once you start talking about tenure . . . and vacation pay . . . and parking privileges and . . . oh shit ! let s just go to california now , right now , before it is too late .
. . . just like that ?
hey . i did not have the heart to wake you .
thanks . what are you doing ?
so how is it going ?
. . . and i think i know why .
why ?
because i was there . and for a moment that night i understood how she came to pull the trigger .
this mean your finally going to finish your thesis ?
look , fuck the thesis . i think there s a book here . your photographs and my research , together .
a book on the warehouse murders ?
what i am thinking is , we can drop down through tennessee , across arkansas and into texas , from there it is a straight shot into california . we do not stop . . . until we hit the fucking ocean .
it is about fucking time , kessler ! i would just about given up on you .
what did he sound like on the phone ?
i like that .
i still think we should have met them first .
oh , yeah . . . he had a real thick accent right outta deliverance . still ? who said anything about a still ? get ya ass up in them woods !
jesus . . . they have probably got five bucks between them . turn around .
we could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes . . .
you mean because i object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while i am eating i am prejudiced ?
feel sorry for him ? obviously you did not get a whiff of that sock ?
bitch , bitch , bitch !
up yours .
. . . and all i am saying is i think we ought to try and get along with them . that is all .
you try , i am gonna pretend they are with somebody else .
carrie .
all set ?
fuck !
who said he is my good buddy ?
yeah , and you should have seen how terrified she was that he would find out . he beats her .
how do you know that ?
stop being so fucking melodramatic ! if it was murder he would still be locked up or on parole , in which case he would not be allowed to leave the state .
what is it ?
that is that ?
there s more . . .
i am scared . a week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun . this afternoon you are out there wielding it around like clyde fucking barrow , for christ s sake ! that is with you ?
okay , it was a cheap thrill , it was stupid , i admit it , alright ? but let s not blow this . not now . . . let s just get the photos .
i cannot believe i agreed to do this .
oh come on , do not give me that shit . . . you wanted to take these photos as much as i wanted you too .
brian i want him out of our car !

who d ya think you are fooling ? i know you better than you think . . .
you were plenty hot .
. . . you know what i mean ?
you are supposed to call me when you lose your job early . i stopped by the mirror factory today , you left quite a mess behind there .
. . . the police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death . and no doubt god will be picking on you on judgement day . . .
you be at this personnel office , friday , three o clock sharp .
what is it ?
. . . janitor s job .
what happened ?
who are you ?
his parole officer .
right , i talked to you on the phone . they say it is a torch job , that sound like your boy ?
could be .
where would we find him ?
hell if i know , crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to texas .
what about the owner of the house . . . . . . this john diebold , any idea where he might be ?
. . . diebold ?
. . . that would be my guess .
looks like somebody cut off his ring finger .
how old you ?
how many people have you had vaginal intercourse with ?
umm . altogether ?
yes . altogether .
hmm . i would say eight , maybe nine .
how many times have you gone unprotected ?
have you ever had anal intercourse ?
yes .
with how many people ?
umm . three i believe . but i am not sure .
were they wearing condoms ?
well , girl . you tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections .
yes !
you are clean .
oh my god . i cannot tell you how nervous i have been . i could not sleep last night .
shit .
what do you think ?
i knew you fucked it ! i sat out here for like two hours ! that girl was like twelve , and you hit it up !
well , how was it ?
oh my god , so good . that girl can fuck .
she can fuck ?
hell yeah . that bitch was bleeding . when i first put it in she screamed real loud . i saw her bite down on the pillow .
oh shit . how long did it take ?
did what take ?
well it took me longer than i thought it would take . it took like minutes to talk her into it . but once it was on , we fucked for a good half an hour . i had to keep taking it out and putting it back in . it hurts the first time .
yeah .
but then when she got into it . she really got into it . it was good .
oh man , it smells like butterscotch .
hell s yeah . she was so clean .
oh man , that is the best .
you could tell she took care of herself . she had all these powders and creams in her bathroom .
you know what else ?
what ?
i can tell that she had just entered puberty .
how ?
well , i was flipping through a picture book of her and her family , right .
right .
and there was this picture of her painting easter eggs or something . and i said , you were cute when you were little .
yeah .
and i looked at her , and thought to myself oh my god , this girl is a baby .
yeah .
i am telling you casper . i think i am getting addicted to that shit .
to what ? virgins ?
yeah . it is like all i think about now . not just that , it is like lately during sex , i start dreaming about these complex fantasies .
what do you mean ?
i mean i am dreaming about going all out , crazy shit .
you mean like fucking two virgins at once .
that would be good . but i mean more like . i do not know . like when i was having sex with her , i kept thinking how much i would like to put it in her ass . just to see what would happen .
she is probably smash you in the fucking face .
i do not know about that . she was pretty into it . but i was not gonna try . the whole thing is , you just gotta take it slow . show em some respect .
did you tell her that you loved her ?
shit .
what do you want ?
get another forty . smoke a blunt .
are you hungry ?
you wanna go to paul s house ?
what for ? that guys a dick .
i am sure he is got food . he is always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer .
you think he is got any herb ?
i do not know , he quit dealing but i will bet he will smoke us out .
you think ?
probably .
he lives on th ?
th .
telly .
yeah .
did she suck your dick ?
a little bit . but i did not really want her to .
why ?
i do not know . that is too easy . i mean getting a virgin to suck your dick . that is so easy .
it is right .
i want to knock her guard down . i mean there s a whole philosophy behind it . having a virgin suck your dick , that is basic because there s nothing lost .
it is no big deal , right ?
right . but when you deflower a girl , that is it . you did it . you were the one . no one else can ever do it .
yeah . the way i see it . my outlook on the this situation is . it is like getting fame , you know what i am saying . it is like , if you died tomorrow , and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first .
yep .
you thirsty ?
yeah , i feel dehydrated .
you got any money ?
three pennies and a ball of lint .
you down with the boost ?
you know like in the wonder twins they share everything .
the cartoon ?
yeah . the wonder twins . you know . activate in the form of , a glass of water .
yeah .
well , those guys share everything , right ?
right .
and once i saw this episode where they pretended they were each other . where they lived the other s life for a day . you know those guys share everything , right ?
right .
and it got me thinking . how fun it would be to share each other s girl .
yeah , that would be fun but i do not like any of the girls you go out with . like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring .
can you do it man ?
that girl you boned last year . remember ?
but that is the thing . girl s like it slow . they like romance . they like things to be sweet and romantic .
yep .
i mean i have been with a lot of girls i know .
i hate this game .
man , this guy is really good .
i wanna fuck darcy .
who ?
darcy . benny s little sister .
oh . you like her ?
yeah . i like her . i have wanted to get with her for a while now .
darcy ?
yeah . she is so little , so pretty , and innocent .
yeah . she is only .
it is funny . last weekend at that block party . remember ?
yeah .
she was handing out those watermelon slices . and i sat down over on the other side , and i watched her .
yeah .
i watched her eat the watermelon . and all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt .
yeah .
i am not joking . i wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there . at that point and moment , darcy was like a vision of perfection .
i know what you mean .
at that moment , at that block party , she represented everything holy about a virgin .
she hangs out at nasa . she promotes for them .
i am gonna fuck her tonight . i swear to god i am gonna fuck her .
how are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day ? that shits gotta be against the law .
i do not care motha fucka . i will bet you money she fucks me .
you wanna run by the park and see what everybody s doing ? get zooted ?
i do not understand why you do that .
why i do what ?
that .
why i give pennies ?
yeah . why you give money .
did you look at that guy ? what the fuck . he had no legs . he had no half his lower body . he is gotta shit out of his ribcage .
that is just it . it is elitist . it is reverse elitism . because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up . i notice what you do .
what are you talking about ?
whenever you see someone who s really messed up , especially amputees and retards . you give them money . but if it is just a regular bum , you pass them by .
so .
so . these people live on the same streets . it is just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up . the regular bums are not poor enough for you , you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks .
so . you never know when you can end up like that .
right .
i will tell you why . because when i was little , i had a fat cousin , cousin luke . and he used to make fun of the handicapped . and one day he had a bad stomachache . so he drank a bottle of pepto and his ass blew off .
shut up .
so really , it is good luck .
good luck ?
man , telly , your little brother is getting big .
holy shit man , your mom s got good titties .
how much you gonna take ?
about ten . fifteen is good .
you think darcy is gonna be at nasa tonight ?

because i like you . i think you are beautiful . i think if we fucked you would love it . you would not even believe it .
i would not believe it ?

you are being ripped open .
i know .
did you bleed ?
i did not bleed .

hell yeah . i love . i love sex .
right . you are like it is just this instinct . it is like this animal instinct is taking over you . it is like . . .
passion . . .
yep , yep . but he has to know what he is doing and where he is going . because they can like touch you for hours and they will not ever know .
like where are your erogenous zones ?
mine ?
i hate sucking dick !
yeah . cause they fucking shoot you in the eye , the face , the ear .
and sometimes it takes a long time , and you are fucking gagging .
yeah . and then it hits that little thing . that little punch bag . what is it ? the tonsils . the esophagus , whatever .
yeah . and you are not getting anything out of it .
wish me luck .

yep .
and you do not get shit out of it .
yep . that is the best way . it is that boom boom boom .
right . you know it is not like . . . you know there s a difference between sex , making love , and fucking !
yep .
making love is like .

you know what it is like . it is like when you really love someone , it is like awww .
yeah .
its like . but it gets boring . it is boring .
yeah . mine are my toes . oh my god if someone sucks my toes i will come in like ten seconds !
yeah . it depends . cause like this one time with eric , when we got blasted at his house . and smash j and dj flipper was there . . .
oh shit .
yep .
but then the sex gets into the way and you are like what happened ! what the hell happened ? !
yeah . the shit gets wacked . fifteen minutes .
yeah . fifteen minutes to a half an hour . hard and deep .
me . i can only take it up to fifteen minutes . cause i get bored .
yeah i get bored .
i have known the past of all the people i have fucked without a condom . like i know one of the people got tested and was negative .
yeah .
and i know that one of them fucked like two other girls , who were both virgins , so i knew he was safe .
yeah .
i made her get tested with me because i did not want to go alone .
how can you hang out with casper ? he is such a jerk .
you think so ?
yeah . i have always hated that kid . he used to eat glue in like seventh grade .
he still does .
i hate em .
it is not his fault . he had a hard life .
yeah ?
you have heard the stories right ?
so that is why casper is how he is .
yep .
holy shit . that is all true ?
no . i was just kidding .

hi mom .
sorry . dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job .
but then i will not need your money .

when are you gonna be back ?
not too late .
four thirty in the morning ?
hey mom . are you sure i cannot get any money ? just a few bucks .
if i had it , maybe . but right now i do not have a penny to my name .
hello ?
it is me . telly .

what are you guys doing ?
nothing . we just wanted to come by and see what you were up to .
you want a wip it ?
so , how many people live here now ?
i do not know , eight or nine .
where does everyone sleep ?
that is the whole thing . you know if you look at it . i mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that . and everyone s dying . and you better wear a condom or else . but the truth is . i do not know any kids with aids . no one i know has ever died from that shit . it is like some weird make believe story that the whole world believes .
first times are always wacked . just be glad you did not lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car .
slow .
yeah .
right .
and we were like underneath the sheets . we were going at it like crazy . oh my god that shit was so good ! it was like hard . . .
yeah .
yeah . and it takes them either too long or too short to come . have you ever had someone that took forever
to come ?
it was . . . it was .
it is like sweet and sour , and salty butter .
no , no , no . you cannot get that taste out of your mouth . until you eat something .
yeah .
what man ? what is it ?
yo , let me get in your parent s room man . just fir a little while .
i cannot man .
come on steven hook me up . do me this solid . come on man . i gotta get darcy alone . she is gonna let me fuck her man . please .
shit . all right . but do not fuck with anything ok ?
i have talked to a few people who say you and her were . . . friendly ?
by yourself ?
we seem to have a little problem here ?
what kind of problem ?
i think you are lying . that is what kind of problem .
casual .
casual ? you were boning her were not you ?
it was not serious . that is your problem ?
you are ! i do not like you .
that is that supposed to mean ?
it means , if i were a killer and i thought the police were closing in on me i might invent someone to try and put them off the scent .
that is crazy ! why would i draw attention to myself like that ?
you like to play games , do not you , peter ?
he says on the photo he will call tomorrow at eleven . why not come back then and listen for yourself .
meaning , it looks like his victims are chosen at random .
what do you mean , no ?
he says it is a game . all games have a strategy .
all you gotta do is look at the map .
morpheus .
what ?
are you crazy ?
what in the hell do you think you are doing ? slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace .
we did not ask for your opinion , doctor .
you do not tell us how to run our investigation . you got that ?
you know , i figure that is pretty much how these girl s feel just before they get it . you think i am right ?
i would not know .
that is right . i guess only the killer would know that .
how would you get in here ?
the door was open .
no it was not .
of course it was . otherwise i would be breaking and entering . that is a felony .
what do you want ?
no .
i used to . with my old man . he taught me how to hunt and trap . trapping s a lot harder than most people think . we used to go after raccoons mostly . they would get into our garbage , our fields . when an animal cannot live peacefully with those around it , it has to be destroyed . but they are crafty little devils . you see the trick is , you can put your trap down , but no raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent . you ever smell raccoon scent ? smells like shit , but to a male raccoon it smells just like pussy . he will walk right up to that trap , even though it do not look nothing like a raccoon and stick his goddam head right in it . you know why ? cause he cannot help himself . the scent drives him . so , if you want to catch a raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is lay down the scent and sooner or later he will walk right into the trap .
what if he does not bite ? what if he is an exceptionally bright raccoon ?
you got it on the board .
no , i need the original note .
he is not talking about himself .
then that is he talking about ?
then let s narrow it down .
we are interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there .
you sure you were not over on pine road ?
i am positive .
you are a lying bastard !
fuck you ! i am tired of your goddam accusations ! if you want to arrest me go ahead ! otherwise back off .
yes you are .
you set yourself up tonight when you attacked kathy , you crazy fuck !
the message ! i figured out
you want me to what ?
i want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer .
it will take hours . you cannot make me do this .
you are right , i cannot make you do it . besides , you are probably gonna be too busy with the franchise tax board anyway .
what are you talking about ?
i gotta friend over there . he was telling me things are kind of slow . so , i figured i would give him a call , have him come down here and look through your records . you know , give him something to do .
sorry to ruin your trip to the city , but we got a real nut on our hands , frank .
debi rutlege . female . caucasian . twenty four . worked over at the four oaks hotel .
local ?
what do you think ?
he is got an answer for everything , but he does not have an alibi .
you think he is dirty ?
we would not want someone s death to interfere with your games .
take it easy . both of you .
no shit !
sorry .
the f . b . i . has nothing remotely similar to this guy . i think he is a first timer .
you still having a problem with this ?
we have checked . there s no one with the last name of emma on the island .
how is she ?
she is unconscious , but they think she is going to make it .
you alright ?
i have seen a lot of things in my time on the job , but nothing like this . yurilivich ?
i was with him the whole time until i got the call at the hotel .
i spoke to jeremy . he is watching sandersongs kid . sanderson went out after the match and has not come back since .
what is it ?
ready for round two ?
you should be an actor , frank . you looked like you were really mad . the veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch .
why does he call sanderson ?
sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing but who called him today ?
i do not know . maybe there s two of them . maybe he hired some wino to make the calls .
a few people .
did anyone stand out ?
what do you mean , stand out ?
did anyone look suspicious ? think !
now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious .
it does not make sense because we do not understand it .
do not fuck with us ! where did you go !
remember eventually revenge is carefully . . . have you tired juxtaposing the words ?
oh , c mon . we are not going to spend any more time on this crap , are we ? it does not mean anything . it is sanderson !
it is not him . frank , you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this .
we will find the evidence .
hello , peter .
who is this ?
someone who s going to become an important part of your life . i want to play a game with you .
hello , peter .
very amateurish , peter . i am surprised you would use such an obvious tactic . i am not an idiot ! do not treat me as one ! i will call you everyday . . . you get one minute , whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you ! are you ready to play ?
yes . why did you kill debi rutlege ?
to get your attention .
did you know her ?
and what path is that ?
we all have paths to follow . you hope yours will lead you to me .
why did you write remember on the wall ?
that is something you will have to figure out for yourself . really , peter , you cannot expect me to answer such direct questions .
why not ?
you do not want to think and that is why i will win ! i am already two points ahead .
i did another one last night . you might have saved her , but you did not want to play .
where is she ?
you will find her .
i suppose you want to know where i am going to kill tonight , peter ?
you are not going to tell me that .
hello ?
do you know what i am doing right now , peter ? i am looking at the name of the girl i am going to kill tonight .
you know her ?
not really .
why her ?
because she is the type .
but you said you did not know her .
i know what i said ! she looks just like . . .
just like who ?
i really wish you would stop trying to maneuver me . i find it irritating , not to mention insulting .
i am just trying to play the game .
i am sure there are other people who would be interested in what i have to say .
just for that no hint today .
why are you doing this ? you must have some idea of the pain you are causing people .
and you want these girls to feel your pain ?
please , i do not want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions . it would detract from the game .
how ?
huxley s quote also says , his play is always fair and just .
have you any idea what the message is ?
if it is so important , why do not you just tell me ?
i could not tell you that . it would ruin the game . not that you are playing it very well .
what ?
you heard me . why did you go out to the institute looking for her ?
what makes you think i was there ?
i could not tell you that . it would ruin the game .
it is you who s running out of time . you are starting to make mistakes now . you are wondering just how much i really know . just how close i am getting ? well , i am closer than you think , pal and i am gonna nail your ass to the wall !
hello .
last night was very exciting , was not it ? have you figured out what i am doing ?
you are playing the tarakoss opening .
very good .
you are next move should have been e e .
i used a variation . you should have anticipated that . have you figured out the message ?
what word did you leave last night ?
the police have not told you ?
interesting concept . i had not thought of that . if you think about how anton berger plays chess you might get it .
i am beginning to think it does not mean anything . remember eventually revenge
hello , peter .
you sonofabitch !
emotional ? i expected more from you .
if you kill tonight and i am in jail the police will know i am innocent .
by that time the game will be over .
i have figured out the message .
yes ?
congratulations on your daring escape . you just missed me by a few seconds . it is check , peter .
let me speak to my daughter .
she is in the other room . i just wanted you to know she was not dead . . . yet . but it is time for her to die now .
please . . . wait .
the game s over . you lost .
it is me you want . not her .
that would not be very sporting . remember huxley ? his play is always fair and just .
you are groping . i have been fair . it is my move now .
i will give you anything you want . anything ! please !
i was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die but i have decided it is better if you do not know exactly when i kill her . good bye peter .
i know where you are .
very good . how did you know ?
how would you know i would not be in the same room with her ?
this is not going to help , david . you are mother s dead . you cannot undo it .
you do not understand .
yes , i do . i found your file . i know what happened .
they took away the game because of him . my father left and my mother . . . there was so much blood . . . it covered everything .
do not you see ? i had to make it right . i ignored my mother s crossing . i sat with them all . i held their hands . i stroked their hair . i was with them to the end . i took away the blood . i washed them . their crossing was peaceful .
naw , it is all fixed . i also loaded up a program that will analyze your games three hundred percent faster .
that is this ?
oh , i put a few games on for your daughter . i hope you do not mind .
sure . we have got a modem line hooked up with the data base in new york .
can we correlate data ? look for specific things , like player s ages . . . stuff like that ?
no problem . we are in .
nope . nothing .
d d . . . b c . . . and c f . it is the number two variation of the tarakoss opening . david , can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years .
now what ?
there s three . the first is . lionel baines . the boston . . .
never mind . he died two years ago .
. hans korshaud .
what is it ?
computers . that is how you got into homesearchers records . you can get into anything . but why ? why ?
you still have not figured it out , have you ? you think that i have put you through an ordeal . my scars run so much deeper than yours .
what scars ?
you might not have done it had you known .
you are damn right ! i am a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer !
would you mind keeping your voice down ? i have guests .
the police came to me for help . what could i do ?
you could have been honest with me for starters . we work together . i have to be able to trust you .
i admit i handled it badly . sanderson was not going to talk to me . . . but you are young , attractive
the same type as the girl who got killed . jesus , alan , the guy could be a psychopath .
they asked who would be best suited for this and you
it worked out alright , did not it ?
feeling better ?
i just cannot believe it .
you do not want to believe it . it is a normal reaction .
kathy , please . you are going to wear a hole in the carpet .
i am just nervous . sorry .
you are safe . he would not come here .
why did he ?
why did he what ?
come here .
he was watching you .
yeah that is what we have always thought but what if he was not ? what if i had nothing to do with the reason he came here ?
you must be erica .
uh huh .
is your dad here ?
so , are you having a good time on the island ?
not really . it is pretty boring .
that is only because you do not know where to go . you like hiking ? fishing ? sailing ? what do you like ?
do you like my dad ?
i know he really likes you .
how do you know that ? did he say something ?
okay . nice meeting you .
congratulations , dad .
what are you doing up ?
i cannot sleep . my beds lumpy .
i see . you forgot to bring you are night light , did not you ?
that has nothing to do with it .
you want to sleep in my bed tonight ?
who told you that ?
mrs . lutz . she also told me that mr . lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great grandmasters in the spirit world .
has he gotten through to any ?
what is it , dad ?
do not you have something you want to say to david ?
you ready ?
for what ?
you told me you would take me over to seattle today .
i am sorry , honey , i cannot . not today .
it is not kathy .
whaddaya got , nolan ?
not much . there s no sign of a break in . i think she let him in .
how long has she been dead ?
six , eight hours tops .
any sign of rape ?
there s no blood . where is the fucking blood ?
anything ?
not much . i do not think she was raped . there s no bruising , or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath .
what about prints ?
no prints .
you mean , no prints but hers ?
he tapes their mouths shut . we found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths . we are doing a chemical analysis for components , but it is probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store .
there s only two hardware stores on the whole island . we will check that out . what about the blood ?
this is where he forced his way in . we found some fibers on the windowsill , probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through . i will know more once i get it under the microscope .
that is great .
same as the others ?
yeah .
how long she been dead ?
i would say at least eighteen hours .
well ?
well what ? i told you this was a stupid idea . you cannot learn anything from someone in a few minutes .
you did not pick up any vibes from the guy ?
i am a psychologist , frank . . . not a psychic . that is this all about anyway ?
only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to sanderson for some case you are working on . what would he do ?
we are not sure .
what do you think he did ?
i am busy right now .
i see you are still having problems with your openings .
and this jeremy
no . i told him to . i wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end .
but we heard him .
kathy ?
well , the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim .
that would indicate he is playing out a fantasy . power control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them . once they become a reality though , they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it . but , in all the research i have read on serial killers , i have never heard of one moving so fast . it is as if the game is the catalyst for the murders not the other way around .
anything else ?
yes . why disguise your voice if no one knows it ?
i was thinking the same thing . he must be local . it is logical for him to assume that the police would be there , but he recognized andy s voice and called him by name . what about this ?
i do not think it matters . last nights victim , christie eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town . the night before , debi rutlege was found in the center .
his home would be . . . mount olympus .
before we go in i gotta tell you this is not going to be pretty .
i know that . i have seen the photo s .
you never know how you are going to catch a suspect .
well , i think you have to play to his ego . he thinks he is superior . the more secure he feels , the more chances he will take .
maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have . all the girls that have been killed have been killed at night . they are all the same type . all moved into their homes within the last three months and all of them found their homes through homesearchers .
i thought that homesearchers was a dead end ?
it cannot be a coincidence . the woman that owns it has a son . she says he is been on vacation in montana for the last ten days . we are trying to locate him . there s also a cleaning service that comes in once a week . we are checking that out too .
each of those grids represents almost a square mile .
as large as castles .
what time did he get there ?
he is right , kathy .
we cannot rely on your judgement anymore .
and what if he is wrong . if you were one hundred percent sure it was peter you would have arrested him . if it is someone else then he is going to kill again tonight and you are sitting here ignoring the message .
we are going to work on the message .
this stinks ! you want to know what i think ? i think there have been five murders and you have got shit to go on . you need to blame someone and he is the easiest choice .
the most logical choice .
did you see his face ?
no . he was wearing a mask . . . but i saw the cut on his wrist . it was peter .
i cannot arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist . do you have someone you can stay with tonight ?
i have got a room at the institute i use when i stay late .
if you can think of anything else give us a call .
excuse me . . . you said earlier that mary albert just moved in . how long ago was that ?
ten days ago .
do you know how she found the apartment ?
through a rental agency .
i know you are busy so i will get right to it . did you know her ?
could you tell me where you were last night ?
here . i played gregory lutz .
i know . you won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five . where did you go after that ?
this is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room . here s one at pm . it says from debi . please call me at home .
she called to give me my schedule for tomorrow .
that is interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing . yet , she says on her message for you to call her at home and she does not leave a number . that would imply you already knew the number .
why did not you tell us you were there earlier ?
mister sanderson , this is doctor sheppard . she is a psychologist helping us out .
you want me to go with you ? maybe i can help .
what have you come up with on the riddle ?
wee willie winkie runs though the street . we think he might be making a reference to himself .
maybe , but i do not think so . i think it is just a tease .
that is it ?
we think he might be making a reference to drugs ? miss emma is a street term used by junkies for morphine .
another one ? what word did he leave ?
as large as castles . you are still light as air , one hundred men cannot move me .
he is using the map as a chessboard ! the sonofabitch is playing chess with me ! !
how can he be playing chess with you ? you are not making any moves against him .
i still do not see how he could be playing chess against you . there s only enough grids on the map to be half a board .
it is a commercial area . no one lives there .
as large as castles , you are still light as the air , one hundred men cannot move me . it is posed as a question . what am i ?
a building ?
he is not going to give us direct hints . he is going to skirt around it .
a shadow . that is as big a castle ? as light as air , but one hundred men cannot move it ? the shadow of the castle . are there any buildings that have the name castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building ?
wait a minute . there s an apartment in that area called the castle arms .
where were you last night ?
are we going to go through this again ?
answer the question .
jeremy would have never killed himself .
maybe he just got tired of covering for you .
do not you understand what i am telling you ? that is why he wants me out of the way .
i understand that this is just another one of your games .
alright , c mon peter . we are moving you to a cell .
did you send the car ?
you opened with the english . lutz will not use it . he opened his first game with it .
he knows you are aware of that .
then i will transpose .
on a variation , yes but it must be a variation that is unique .
it is a good play , but risky .
we got a problem ?
our computer went on the fritz again . david came up to fix it .
peter . . .
i have got be here for the police when they come . then i have got to practise . in case you forgot i am in the middle of a match right now .
you are always in the middle of a match .
you have something you want to say ?
just thought you might want to talk .
about what ?
whatever s on your mind .
what do you see here ?
mate in five .
she went into town with mrs . lutz . did they get him ?
no .
feel like practicing ?
bainbridge books .
hi , sara . this is doctor sheppard . i was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called principals and tactics by anton berger .
i can check and call you back .
thank you . i am at .
bainbridge books .
sara , this is doctor sheppard . i called you earlier about a book .
yes , doctor sheppard . we called you back but you were not home . we have the book .
could you please do me a big favor ? in the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess . could you look and tell me what they are ?
of course . yes , here it is . why , they are all the same ?
what are they , please ?
sorry . i thought it was empty .
is this your first time here ?
i love this hotel . i stay here every time i visit my parents .
how come you do not stay with them ?
because i love them , but they drive me crazy . you know how parents are ?
are you with the tournament ?
uh huh .
are you one of the players ?
yes .
i have always wanted to learn how to play chess . i do not have the patience for it . when did you start playing ?
when i was very young .
it seems like such a complicated game .
not really . you see your goal and you go after it . anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed .
sounds very violent .
but you enjoy being the stronger one ? you like the control .
if you are asking me if i am passionate about what i do , the answer is yes . without passion , nothing moves us . that is your passion ?
that is a very personal question .
i see . this is going to be a very polite conversation . what shall we discuss ? the weather ? movies ?
are you disappointed that i will not answer you ?
i had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation .
i thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess .
it is .
do you always open quickly ?
are we talking about me , or chess ?
you .
each circumstance requires a different tactic .
well , i think i have had enough .
what are you looking for ?
nothing . i just came in for a steam .
they could not break the riddle .
did you think it was going to be easy ? you think he was going to lay it out at your feet ?
we need your help .
i offered my help this morning and sedman turned me down .
but you are the key . the one he wants to play the game with .
i cannot right now . i have got a game .
she could be dead after the game .
she could be dead now .
you sure you do not want to eat something ?
it is going to be a long night . it could take hours before we know something . you should try to eat .
you sound like my mother .
it was not intentional .
i think it is interesting .
another kind of game ?
in a way .
this is not a game .
oh , but it is . he is killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him . that is a game . it has rules and objectives .
how can you look at it so clinically ?
take your average cop . they deal with death everyday . if they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement .
that is true but the emotion is still there . they just learn to control it .
what about you ? are not there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry ?
of course .
do you ?
let s change the subject .
i am just curious .
i think it is best if we do not ask too many personal questions i want to keep things on a professional level .
you mean like in the steam room ?
that is not fair !
you are projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did .
you have to win every point , do not you ?
i just wanted to know if you are involved with anyone ? let me ask you something ? do your colleagues know if you are involved or not ?
of course .
why ?
no .
you are not ?
relax .
how the hell can i relax after seeing what i just saw .
i know it was bad .
i know you did not
you know , andy thinks you are doing this .
does not that scare you ?
no .
why ?
can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it ?
no . but i am open to distractions .
you know , you are not the easiest person in the world to get close to .
you always want to talk about me . what about you ?
was not i just talking about me ?
no . you were talking about chess .
alright . what about me ?
i dunno . where is erica mother ?
she died in a car accident .
i am sorry .
it is alright . it was a long time ago .
it must have been very hard on erica ?
it was .
what ?
have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games .
i am not playing a game now .
yes you are . you are playing word games .
what is this ?
i am just trying to get to know you , peter .
nobody could attack you . you set your life up like one of your chessboards . you are impregnable but at the same time you have become trapped behind your own defenses . you are cut off from everyone around you .
what are you talking about ? you do not even know me .
i just do not want to fight with you .
this frightens me because i am starting to feel things i have not felt in a long time .
you have got to face the things you feel .
i thought you were the woman who did not want to get involved .
you can turn everything around so easily . this is not just another game , is it ?
i am hungry .
fine .
what do you want on it ?
you .
would you settle for pepperoni ?
did you call ?
they are not delivering . i am going to go pick up the pizza .
i thought you said the line was busy ?
i tried again and got through .
that is wrong ?
nothing .
peter , you have to admit
peter . . .
in a fierce magazine you will find a hint of my actions to come . . . why does he set this line apart ?
for emphasis ?
exactly . it is the key .
but what does he mean by a fierce magazine ? violent ?
a fierce magazine . . . brutal . . . an angry magazine . . . a war magazine . . . a mercenary magazine . . . fierce . . . mad .
what ?
he is replaying the game i played against him move by move , using these girls as the chess pieces . all the girls have been found in their homes except christie eastman , who was found in back of a warehouse . why ?
because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid ?
hi .
the other night i said some things that maybe i should not have . i mean , you have not known me very long and i can see how you thought what you did .
i am not looking for an apology , peter .
i was thinking that . . . maybe when this is all over we could . . .
i want someone i can get close to . i do not know if that is possible with you .
peter . . .
no , listen . you have no idea of the kind of pressure i am under right now .
that is still no excuse . you treat everything like a game .
i cannot think any more , unless it is about you . i will be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move , i think about how you look when you smile . remember how you said that i hide behind my chessboard ? ever since my wife died i have been . . . i have been afraid of getting too close to someone again afraid of losing them .
you are wife died . you cannot feel responsible for that .
you do not understand .
then help me to understand . i want to understand .
it is not that easy .
of course it is not . it is always difficult when someone you love dies . but you cannot feel responsible because she had a car accident .
but i do .
why ?
this letter . i have never opened it .
why not ?
because i know what it says .
if we could just figure out what the next word is going to be . he said the game s going to end tonight so there s only going to be one more word .
it could be anything .
how did you know it was carefully ?
frank told me .
you are right . the killer told me .
this is not going to be like the phone book , is it ?
you are going to be late for your match .
are you going to come tonight ?
you beat him .
i got lucky .
it is over now .
i just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future .
hello , peter . you played an interesting game last night . even though sacrificing your queen at b is the game i played against valsney in . i am glad it helped you .
i am sure you are .
no , i want you to do good . that way when i beat you at the end i will look that much better .
you are getting sloppy , yurilivich . you are nervous ?
i am not nervous .
well , you should be , because this time i am going to win .
i am sorry . i could not help it .
i do not have to go through with it either .
you do not understand . i am just so u relieved u . i was u sure u you would turn out to be short and fat and gimpy .
oh . that . i know what you mean . i had nightmares all week .
me too .
last night was the worst . i dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other , and walked like a penguin .
mine was worse i dreamt you picked your nose in public .
that is worse .
you are really not bad looking . almost handsome .
well , you are beautiful .
you u might u be handsome . i cannot tell through all that grime . besides , you reek of sweat and horses .
if you are going to marry a warrior , you would best get used to it .
take off your clothes . i am going to scrub you down .
u what u ?
we are almost married .
we are not married u yet u .
i do not trust you to wash behind your ears .
there . now you look like someone i might want to marry .
maybe you would better look around for another candidate . i do not think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush .
i do not have to look around . i have found the husband i want . you can kiss me now .
thank you , but i can wait .
i lied .
about what ?
lyssa . . . lyssa . . .
have they harmed you ?
lyssa . where are they keeping you ?
lyssa . . .
colwyn . . .
where is the fortress ?
i do not know . it is a maze of tunnels . i cannot see out .
i will find you . i will be with you .
i know it .
i love you , lyssa , i love you . . .
colwyn . . .
you must move away from the center .
will your power outward .
i do not know how .
take the western passage .
yes .
move quickly . we are coming for you . we are in the fortress .
lyssa . . .
in the arctic ice .
that is a better one .
you will both wait . at least for five hours . the wedding is at three .
it was a platonic kiss , father .
they have lyssa !
you will go alone .
i will not leave you here .
you will do as i tell you . you will try to reach ynyr , the old one .
i must follow the slayers . they have taken lyssa .
the white castle has fallen .
does the queen live ?
the new queen lives .
turold s son was to marry her .
we were married . then she was taken by the slayers . you must help me .
this is not the first time the dark ones have attacked our world . they came once before , a thousand years ago . a young king and queen , with extraordinary powers , were given to us then , to lead the struggle . my fore father was their councilor , as i will be yours .
i have no extraordinary powers .
your powers are greater than you know . have you ever seen one of these ?
with two or three days practice , you will be able to use it as well as i can . then we will have a chance of fighting our way out of here .
two or three days ! while lyssa is in their hands ?
there is no other way .
but it opens onto the sheer wall of the needle . there s no way down .
you have rope ?
i am too old to climb down a rope .
there is nothing .
reach out farther . call to her .
you must break when the strain becomes too great , or you will harm yourself . and you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most . what did she answer ?
she was in a great fortress , first in the mountains , then in the jungle . how is that possible ?
it is the fortress of krull . i know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds . they did not use it on our world in the first great war , for it costs them enormous power . this time they mean to conquer , at all costs .
the fortress moves ?
yes . each dawn it rises in a different land sometimes in the mountains , sometimes in the jungle , sometimes the desert , sometimes the sea . never in the same place twice .
then even if lyssa tells us where she is , we will never be able to reach her , for they will never allow the fortress to rise near us .
no . they occupy the fortress , but they cannot control its movement . it is moved by fate . and , sooner or later , fate will place it near us .
then we must be ready . five leagues from here is the eastern tower . i know the barons who hold it . good men , and brave . they will help us .
you have not slept in two days .
you choose these ?
they know when they are going to die ?
i cannot reach her .
what do you see ?
she cannot see out . she cannot tell us where the fortress is .
yes , they knew of your first contact , so they drove her below .
she was very faint . i was barely able to reach her .
the deeper she goes , the harder it is to contact her . once she is below the second level , you will not be able to reach her at all .
i cannot reach her .
the first time , when they attacked long ago , was the beast here ?
no . then they were led by his underlings . but i knew he had come this time , from the ferocity of their onslaught , from their use of the fortress . they use up much of their strength to do these things . they are taking great risks .
u why u ?
i am not sure .
but you suspect .
no . we will find another way to locate the fortress .
there is no other way . you asked me why the beast had come this time .
yes .
he has come for lyssa .
lyssa ? u why u ?
like you , she has extraordinary powers . he would make her his queen .
can she be forced ?
no . she must agree of her own free will .
never .
you are young . you do not understand the attraction of great power , and you forget the pain of long waiting .
then we must reach her before she feels that pain .
traitor ! she will marry you in hell !
i will melt that gold and pour it down your throat , old man !
from here , i must go alone .
you will tell me her name and we will go together .
he ran a great risk , helping us today . if he opposes his fate , his death will be terribly painful .
they will hold lyssa in the center of the vortex , the place of the beast , where its power is greatest . no man can match it there . lyssa must try to move toward us . for as we enter the vortex and move closer . . .
the beast will kill her .
she must make a glaive .
the spiral begins in the west .
she is on the other side of this wall . i can feel it !
i chose the wrong passage .
she can see the beast !
use your sword .
what use is my sword ? i cannot reach her !
you must move quickly . the beast will stop at nothing now .
you are coming with us .
it is my fate to die in the fortress .
no ! you cannot know that !
i can . because i choose it .
how did you know ?
slayers !
do not let the waters touch you .
they can be saddled .
you have done it ?
i road them often in my youth .
it is today ?
each to his fate .
i know the cruelty of such a fate .
perhaps you think no man would return to me .
am i not worth returning to ?
yes .
am i not beautiful enough to be loved ?
yes .
even by you ?
you too are lonely .
i ache with it .
let me comfort you .
i cannot take comfort when she has none .
then give me comfort . sleep with me tonight .
i cannot betray my bride .
i feel your pain , but i cannot betray her .
you will not , then ?
help ! help ! i am drowning !
i doubt it . the water is only an inch deep .
it could have been quicksand ! i might have been sucked to my death . where is this place ?
a forest near the valley of needles .
blast ! a thousand miles off course . well , i was rushed . there was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie . the foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill . what did he expect ?
perhaps he expected to eat it .
i just remembered i have urgent business in this direction .
what business ?
once is enough , thank you .
your kingship . . . your lord high mightiness . . . when i called you a . . . a . . . whatever i called you , i did not realize that you were . . . were . . .
i was hoping i might be your friend .
my u friend u .
i have need of friends .
not yet , my friend . it is your tomato that is dying .
try your tricks on me and i will turn myself back into a snake and bite you .
you and i will guard the fire .
i do not think you will grow careless .
smart as well as quick . now what do you have to give us ?
fame .
fame ? thank you , no . fame is the burial ground of contentment . eat it and go hungry count it and go broke seek it and grow mad . fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun .
fame is what you leave to your sons .
how did you know i had sons ?
because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for .
hah ! you do not know me , boy .
they stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes . do you know who i am , sprout ? i am torquil , lord of the forest . my men follow no man but me , and i follow no man at all .
you will follow me .
and in the few seconds before i dice you to crow food , tell me why i am going to follow you .
and where do you lead , boy ?
to the place where death lives .
it should be an interesting journey , then .
that i promise you .
when did you last sleep , boy ?
they burn many villages . even walled cities fall to them .
i am not hungry .
not sleepy , either ?
forgive me . it is childish to cry .
well , i am not impressed .
you have eaten nothing .
we must try to get horses .
yes . it will double our range . i know at least a dozen ways to get horses . all cheap .
these we will pay for .
lad , you have an unnatural desire to pay for things . it stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination .
hand over your dinner .
forgive me , my friends . i saw terrible things .
go , join them .
what kind of friend do you think i am ?
the best . but my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your s to it .
well , it is true that if i received a royal command i could not very well disobey it , could i ?
go . i command you .
we could reach it on fire mares .
we must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise .
you are resourceful , my lad . i tell you , one year under my tutelage and i could make you the prince of thieves .
subject to the king , no doubt .
a good thrust , my friend . another second and there would have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories .
i intend to keep you alive , your majesty . so you can abdicate your throne and become my warlord .
make for the wall . i will catch up .
colwyn , do not be a fool . you cannot do battle with that thing .
nothing worse than lower class boors with upper class morals .
would you settle for a boar ?
you !
me . may i eat with you tonight ?
tonight and every night , my friend , for this is the second time you have saved my life . i am ergo the magnificent , short in stature , tall in power , etcetera , etcetera .
what is that awful looking place ?
the swamp of betrayal . be glad we do not have to cross it .
where are you going ?
we will meet you at the inn .
cannot i come , too ?
a venison pie as big as a house .
a small house .
quell ?
my heart stays here .
bread is for peasants , and wine makes me sneeze . got any gumdrops ?
no .
sugarballs ?
no .
what kind of a boy are you ? boys always have candy .
i have a cinnamon bar .
you do ?
i am ergo the magnificent . . . . . . short in stature . . . . . . tall in power . . . . . . narrow of purpose . . . . . . wide of vision .
i am hungry .
if i could wish . . . . . . for anything , i would wish for a venison pie the size of a . . . . . . mountain . no , that is too greedy . i would settle for one the size of a house .
i would wish for a puppy .
one puppy ? why not wish for a hundred ?
i only want one .
sir ergo ? . . . my honorable lord ergo ? . . .
what ? now you poke me in the nose as well ?
i do not think it is working .
not working ? this nose ? this nose works day and night . this nose has never loafed an hour in its life . this nose . . . what ? impossible . this nose asleep while venison fills the air ? where is it , boy ? tell me where it is and i forgive you everything .
we meant only to please you .
oh , she was so beautiful and i was so u ugly u .
would you desert your friends ?
but also very young . six to one is no odds , boy .
put me down , you lout !
you had better manners as a pig .
what are you doing with my dear ? stop ! thieves !
many villagers are hiding in the forest . they need food .
and do you think i live on air ?
we have plenty of hares .
food for crows .
surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison .
i am being exploited ! where are you going ?
oh , my poor stew !
passable , pimple , very passable .
the greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life , blockhead , is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of ergo the magnificent .
i cannot hold the weight of both of you !
look at its beauty . look at its grace .
look at its insides .
my spells always go wrong when i am observed . be gone !
the forest is not safe these days . you would best travel with us .
one with red eyes , the other with one eye , both trying to kill me .
the one with red eyes was a dark one , the other was a cyclops , and it was not you he meant to kill .
he was aiming a huge spear right at me !
he did not join them . they joined him .
and who is u he u that they should join u him u ?
he is the king .
they will trample him to death !
i do not want your power . it is hideous .
i do not want your worlds or your slaves .
it is a lie !
these walls do not lie ! he will betray you .
he will not !
he will come for me .
what news from our friends ?
barak is still strong in the north , and tendo holds the high passes . but the great desert forts have fallen .
freylag s stronghold ?
it has been taken , freylag and all his people slaughtered .
it is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen .
the attacks are unceasing by night , the dark ones by day , those of our people who have sold themselves to them , those traitors who are called the slayers .
it is the way of all invaders . those they would conquer they divide , buying allies with promises of land and power .
lord rowan is one of lyssa s godfathers . he will defend her in the ceremony . i wish that lord modred were here . he is a godfather of her own blood .
for some , the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood . no matter . i had hoped to have the wedding next spring , lord turold , with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance . but fate and this war have ordained otherwise .
it is important to assure the succession .
i will tell you something you did not know , turold . had it been my choice , all those years ago , i would have chosen you for my king . but my parents chose otherwise .
i knew .
you knew ! you are a rude bumpkin !
a girl of some spirit , your daughter .
a match for your son , i think .
a fine match .
you were attacked in the forest ?
yes . we lost five .
i tried to reach ynyr , the old one . i led a hundred men to his place in granite needle , but it was surrounded . the dark ones guard it by night and by day they call out the slayers . ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in .
how many did you lose ?
sixty at the needle , another thirty in the forest . only ten of us made it back .
modred ! impossible !
we seek the fortress of krull .
such a vision will be opposed . who seeks it ?
the new king .
with an old voice ?
you know the voice .
yes . you have left your place in the needle . it is the time , then .
it is the time .
can you see ?
the dark ones will appose you with all their power .
knowledge i would not want .
we will seek an emerald seer . they have great powers of vision .
we can save half a day by crossing the stone lake .
many have perished in that maze .
the leader of the dark ones ?
i must go to the widow . perhaps she will help .
the widow of the web ?
yes .
that creature helps no one . and none who go there return .
she has the power of vision .
she has the power to kill .
perhaps she will not kill me , for i know her name .
her name is death .
few have survived it .
each to his fate , lad .
we must reach the valley of reeds before the next dawn .
i will stay behind and keep them busy .
look .
kegan !
go now . quell was wise . he knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends .
who speaks that name !
it is fifty years since i heard that name .
it is fifty years since i spoke it to you .
i was beautiful then .
the most beautiful woman in the world .
but you would not stay with me .
could not . could not betray the girl to whom i was betrothed .
she was not as beautiful .
no , she was not as beautiful .
she bore you many children ?
we had no children .
you had a son .
you said nothing . you told me nothing .
you had left me ! i kept silent out of rage .
where is he ? my son .
do not try your trickery on me !
it is no trickery .
you see ?
memory is no trick , it is a power . the power to see .
power you have given me . what can my power give you ?
knowledge .
of what ?
the fortress of krull . when will it come near here ?
why must you know ?
there is a girl there . her name is lyssa .
you lie !
could i lie to you and still see your beauty ?
no .
a young man seeks her . a young man about the age i was when i met you .
it will not help .
i cannot stop the sand .
you cannot stop time . go now , before it runs out .
you will come with me .
that is that mangs name ?
why do you want to know ?
he forgot his money . . . my mother s got a pub , behind the corner , and he forgot his money , about .
give me his name , i will mail him .
ok . mister stansfield , norman stansfield .
. . . office .
yeah . . . how do you know it ?
yeah , pal ! and i did not say anything , i said i do not know you . but do you know what did she say , that stupid raphaella ?
no ?
she told them you wanted her things and that she was not surprised police looked for you ! can you believe it ? !
asshole . but she will not miss anything , that . you will see .
good , what are you going to do ? do you come back ?
yeah ! i was sure ! come on , tell me ! i know him ?
no .
i cannot believe it ! yes i think . . . how she kids me ! i cannot believe it ! and did he pass your threshold or not ?
. . . what ?
well . . . did you sleep with him or not ?
no . . . not yet . he is very shy . . . and very sensitive .
. . . good . . . but that is special in him ?
. . . you moved too , did not you ?
yeah .
huh ! ? because of the slaughter at your same floor ?
. . . not at all .
it is better . . . you see , it is my turf , so i do not want contracts i am not informed about , on my turf . i am not opposing , but the least they can do is informing me , is not it ?
at a certain moment i thought maybe leon would like working on his own ? so he makes some little extras ?
dirty work , and i kill no women and no kids .
tell me . . . the money i earn and you keep for me . . .
do you need money ?
no , no .
pay attention to women , leon . they are dangerous , you know ?
yeah . . . well . . . i do not know . . i do not know any .
why cannot i have a bank account ?
take . . .
well , i do not need them . . .
ok , i am fine .
here , this is the light scoop for night shooting . there , you fix client s distance . . . how much to the bench down there in the park ?
huh . . . meters ?
. . . . . .
how can you say it ?
look . when you can see his fingers , it is meters . when you just see his hands , it is about meters . when you distinguish arms from body , it is . when you see nothing more than a shape , you do not shoot . not very sure . you have one chance out of five to miss . a contract means getting all chances on your side . out of . you cannot miss a client . never . . . if the task is delicate or the risk is too big , you double . that is , you insure yourself by another means .
what , for example ?
well , if the guy is far , in a car , and i know weather is going to be bad , rain for example , i think i would plastic the car , with a remote here . i shoot from the distance and if i miss i plastic .
rocket launcher .
wow ! it is brilliant !
who will i aim at ?
the fat man down there , on the bench .
good ! first shot !
yeah , but i did not get him , i got his case and now he is behind the tree . what can i do ?
it is not serious , it is just training . you have to learn from the beginning to hit the target , then , to improve precision , you will train , but on cardboards .
ok .
the yellow and pink .
that is up ? i do not feel you are concentrated .
it is incredible ! how did you do it ?
what ?
five minutes . keep in front of the window .
come on , get down !
you were scared , were not you ?
i was nervous , that is all ! where is the guy ?
it is strange , being in love . . . it is the first time for me . . .
how do you know it is love , if you have never been in love before ? . . . it may be friendship . . . or the love you can have with a brother or a father . . . how can you know ?
mathilda ? may i come in ?
why do not you take me with you ? . . . i am ready , now . you said i learn very quickly .
may i go to the cinema ?
no .
for musicals ? that is part of the job !
you see , five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me . . . but i prefer this !
. . . you can leave whenever you want . i do not refrain you .
not taken .
why ?
well . . . then may you rent me your gear for the day ?
if you knew , leon . . . ! i killed one thousand in my head . . . and this never disturbed my sleep .
it is true . . . but a first contract , it is an exception .
. . . i am going to kiss you .
stop . everyone is looking .
. . . you do not believe me , do not you ?
what ?
when i say i love you .
mathilda , do not resume , please . . . . . change subject , ok ?
. . . ok . i love you anyway .
mathilda ? !
ok , ok ! excuse me ! how old were you when you had your first contract ?
. . . shit ! ! we would found him . we waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window .
what shall we do ?
where are you going ?
piddle . she smiles and looks for the bathroom . she finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath , walkman on . she withholds a shout and gets against the wall , without moving . she does not dare passing before the open door again to join leon . in the living room , leon still thinks .
it is cool departing this way . . . warm . . . music . . .
there are better things . you see the importance of the moment . ten minutes early or late , he would have seen death . he would have suffered it . this way , he already departed . without knowing .
. . . i would like knowing what he is listening to . . .
mathilda , had not you told that bullshit to the receptionist , we would still be in the hotel , i make you notice .
that was not bullshit , i said we love each other .
. . . i prefer apartments . . . furthermore , there are always kids in a building . what about getting some friends ?
friends ? you are crazy ! in my building , before , they just cared drugs all day and you could not get one , or they just cared video games and you could not get one , no more .
you are darkening the picture , are not you ?
a little . . .
is there a normal or year old boy ?
it is too big .
risky business , is not it ?
. . . you are young , mathilda . . . you still have a chance to get out . you cannot give up this chance . you have to protect it . there s a lot of things to do in life , a lot of other jobs . . .
mathilda . . . there s equally a lot of other things !
no , excuse me . . . it is the yogurt that made me laugh .
you have just to love me and i will be the happiest woman around .
yeah , i know ! but for the moment you are not yet a woman . so , be patient . . . i need time . . . and you too . you have to grow up .
i am here , i will never leave you again , mathilda , never . i swear .
i love you so much , leon .
poor darling , and then ?
well . . . i do not know , suddenly , the make up . . . all this . . . how are you ? are you ok ?
. . . do not you drink ?
. . . no . . .
how many girlfriends did you have ?
. . . i do not know .
well . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ? how many , approximately ?
. . . mathilda , i do not feel like talking about this .
why ? did you have too many and you fear it may shock me ? i will not get shocked . i am used to this ! my father was a true pig . he fucked the bitch i would as mother all around the apartment . whenever a door was closed , you could be sure they were making sex behind it ! and my sister , if you did not sleep with her , you are building s exception !
. . . i had a girlfriend . . . a long time ago . before coming here , in my country . i was year old . . . we flirted like kids . . . her father did not want her to meet me . my family was not very respectable .
. . . that is awful . i hope you killed , that asshole ?
you . . . you knock the code , when you come back , ok ?
yes .
may i ask you a personal question ?
. . . yes .
what do you do , with the money you earn ?
nothing , for the moment .
maybe it is the time to do something , is not it ?
yeah , what ?
why did you unleash the pipe , i do not know ?
it will take them five minutes ! how long ago did they arrive ?
i do not know . . . five minutes .
how shall we get out now , leon ?
no ! i do not want to leave you ! !
mathilda , listen !
you say it just to calm me !
yes ?
good morning , mister . . . it is danielle !
huh ! you made an error , baby . i do not know any danielle .
. . . i got lost , mister .
huh ? move back , baby , i cannot see anything .
. . . yes ?
excuse me , mister . . . i am looking for mister rubens apartment , but it is dark out here and i got lost . . .
do not fear .
how are you , miss ?
i am sick with practicing , that is it . . .
i see . you are good , because i did not hear anything .
yeah . i put a rag on the strings , to lessen noise .
huh ? that is smart !
i am used to it . not everyone likes music .
yeah , true . but what does your father exactly do for living ?
. . . composer .
huh , that is good !
yeah , but he is not exactly my father . . .
huh ?
you cannot sit here like that .
huh ? why ?
because you have to pay . it is like a parking meter if you stay , you pay . it is the rule . . .
. . . and how much is it ?
. . . ok . . . good .
can i sit on the stairways now ?
rinaldi . . . rinaldi . . . what region do you come from ?
messina .
but . . . he works for your same employer ?
yeah , but i do not give a shit about . i trade at left , at right and that is dangerous in there . . .
it is a little out of the world coming to visit me this way , on mid afternoon . it really is not the usual procedure . . .
. . . who sent you ?
is he still alive ?
yeah . . . and still in messina . he is my uncle .
huh ? are you alfredo s son , then ?
have you ever been in messina , son ?
yes . . . twice .
did you fish in messina ? the pesce spada ?
no . . .
i think i will get back in messina this summer . . . it is too long i have not been there .
you are right , son . you must care the links with your family , always . it is the only important thing in the world .
salute .
you would better talk good , son , because , for the moment , i have got a quite bad opinion about you . norman smiles .
i respect your business , mister tony . every time we asked your help , we were very happy with the result . it is right this that makes me nervous , now . i hope you will excuse my temporary bad mood ?
do you recognize him ?
listen , son , you know as well as me this kind of hitmen they come from nowhere , get the contract and disappear . they are lonely , worse than wolves .
may we have this wolf s name and address ?
he probably just went somewhere .
where ?
what is it ?
this smells good .
why am i such an authority ?
here comes the resume .
uncle maurice , you are wearing sneakers ?
and your store ? what about your new store ? what about all your dreams ?
i have new dreams now .
i do not accept that .
maybe one day after you have been married twenty years you will understand .
uncle maurice i spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here . . . i have a rented car outside , just listen to me . come back with me now , and if you still want to do something like this in a year maybe we will plan a car trip across the country gerald and i will come along
i have to walk by myself all the way every inch .
it is impossible .
it is what she asked for . . . it is what i am going to do .
she was being symbolic . what if she asked you to fly to the moon ?
what if you do not make it ?
i will make it .
if you really want to do this . . . plan it out . rest up . train for it . build up your body . plan every stop along the way . how much money ? time ? really do it properly . this is all so by the seat of your pants .
no it is not .
i have all ready gone six hundred miles . . . i cannot do it again .
nothing s going to happen .
are you two planning kids ?
maybe later .
i do not think you realize how serious this is uncle .
then it will have to wait until i finish .
what ?
listen to me very carefully , because i do not want you to misunderstand me . . . the walk is over uncle maurice . done . finished . you have made it to california , it was a miracle , now let s try to save your life .
i have to finish first .
what would you like us to do ?
put out a p . b . s . . . . or whatever it is called .
a . p . b . . . . he is not breaking any law . he is a grown man . . . he can crawl on his hands and knees to china if that is what he wants to do .
sergeant , i am a psychologist and i know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems . . . my uncle lost his wife and it devastated him .
we are very sorry about that . some of our men were on the scene of the accident .
i think my uncle is suffering from a condition called mania which is linked with depression . it is a time when an individual will act over confident , and will act out impractical , grandiose plans . sometimes these plans can be dangerous .
how long does this . . . mania last ?
look , i will see if anyone has spotted him recently . if i get any information , i will call you .
thank you .
mine .
are you a preacher ?
this is indiana nothing s going to happen to you .
a wife ? . . . did someone piss drunk run into your wife ? crushed her like a bug . snapped her bones ?
oh the preacher s getting angry again . . . tell me something . did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone ? were you there to help her ? or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face
the normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion . this is called , claudication , as a result , there is not enough circulation to your body . that accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms i am sure you have encountered .
can it kill me ?
what steps do we take now ?
we operate . we find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding . . . i just did this procedure on a senator and he is doing fine .
what are the odds ? do i have a fifty fifty chance of surviving the operation ?
so that is the deal maurice ?
pardon ?
i mean why the sudden voluntary visit usually it takes gun point to get you in here . . .
routine , i assure you . i just wanted to gage my health . am i healthy ?
yes you are .
i know what you are getting at .
you do ?
i have seen it before .
you have ?
you are feeling old and you want to start exercising . a lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth . do not feel embarrassed about it .
okay .
you should start slow and easy fifteen minutes a day .
just for curiosity sake that is all ?
i do not know maybe twenty miles . . . of course i am not recommending that . . . if someone like you had to i mean . . . that is how far they would probably get before encountering serious physical walls .
yes ?
you thought i sent them ?
have i forgotten something ? is this a special day ?
it is a special day is not it ?
ellen ?
what ?
the new store ?
honey , i told you . if it makes you happy , we should just do it .
it is a tremendous amount of work moving .
. . . love is shown through actions not just words .
that is that ? that is not a fortune . . . you will be rich . . . that is a fortune . what you have is a statement .
what it is is the truth .
is this going to be similar to the flower incident ?
sometimes people need to see things done for them because sooner or later they do not believe the words anymore .
i want to be shown . . . maurice would you do anything for me ?
yes .
anything ?
what do you want from me ? would i swim across an ocean for you ? . . . would i walk across the united states for you ? yes . . . yes i would . you know that .
why do you polish that thing all the time ?
you are talking to me ?
a book society award is a very prestigious thing .
why are you polishing it in bed in your pajamas at at night ? are you going to show it to someone ?
no .
then why ?
there s no reason .
i do love you . . . very , very much .
show me .
walk with me ?
you like to take walks ?
it is one of those thoughts you keep to yourself .
i thought we both wanted the same things .
i have changed my mind .
i want children .
you have just decided , is that right ?
ellen , there are two kinds of people in the world
please not , the two kinds of people speech .
. . . people that were made to be parents , and people who were not made to be parents . . . my parents , were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway . i do not want us to be that way ellen .
you can change .
face it ellen , i am not the type of person who reads bedtime stories . but you love me anyway .
it must have hit the window . . . i think its neck is broken .
it is not going to make it ellen . let the poor thing go quietly .
your father ?
he is plastered .
that is okay really it is .
i do not know .
i think it is a different place for each person .
i know where my heaven is .
where ?
why there ?
maurice ?
yes .
if i die , you will know where to look for me ?
go to sleep ellen .
the beach of pacifica , california .
what did they ask ?
if i had seen you . by the way i am sorry about your wife . they told me .
thank you . . . i am sorry you had to lie . it must have been difficult .
to where ?
pacifica , california .
from where ?
philadelphia , pennsylvania .
why ?
do you believe a persongs soul lives on after their death ?
most certainly .
and that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them .
that is a reasonable assumption .
i do not want my wife s soul having any doubts .
doubts ? about what ?
you do not have to prove anything to her .
that is his story ?
his name is maurice . he is dancing around everything else .
red flag , man .
red flags man .
not our problem .
why so vague ? why so evasive ? he could be somebody hot .
not our problem .
it is going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the steadmangs house .
this guy s not a murderer .
a marriage certificate ? who the hell carries their marriage certificate around ?
hansengs whipped . has to call his wife every two hours or she will go ballistic when he gets home .
i am going to drop off tandy at the station and then drop you back .
shit ! he jumped !
jumped where ?
well , hello .
i am isaac . . . i am three .
you know what , i can play baseball with my brothers when i am bigger .
is that right ?
you know what . . . i am just little now , but i will be big soon .
you will probably be bigger than your brothers .
i thought you were asleep .
your parents would want you to be in bed .
you tell stories ?
there was a boy named isaac who wanted to play baseball , but he was too small and no one would let him play . . . but he kept practicing by himself waiting . . . he went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove .
you know what . . . maybe i ran onto the field and hit a home run .
anyway , big billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands . who can play baseball ? and there was a little voice that yelled out , me , i can play . everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove .
that is me .
right . but everyone saw how small isaac was and laughed . . . but not big billy . he stared at isaac carefully and then told him to join the game . it came to the end of the game . it was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game . . .
nine .
okay nine . big billy s team was losing and he was on base . that is when isaac came up . he could barely hold the bat . . . big billy winked at isaac . . . the ball was pitched isaac hit the ball hard . it soared up and out over the stadium . everyone cheered . isaac hit a home run and won the game . after the game , isaac asked big billy why he let he play . big billy smiled and said , i was not always big billy , i was little billy first . . . isaac and big billy went off after the game and read a classic book together . the end .
each inch represents miles . . .
making the grand total ?
three thousand miles ? . . . how many times does twenty go into three thousand ?
what was that ?
perhaps there s another route ?
do not worry baby , it should not take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat .
this story is big huh ?
mammoth .
what are you saying ? this story is too big for this paper ?
umm , no . it is just that
michelle , breathe . . . that is it , what is it , talk to me .
umm , he is going to make it is not he ?
lizy , eliza . . . elizabeth bennett . . . pride and prejudice .
you are amazing .
it has to be a full character s name .
they called her lizy in the book . . . sorry i was late . my jeep died on the way over from the paper .
they printed your article on , wouldry verses can dog food . . . very enlightening .
what happened ?
i want to reach people . nobody listens to me . this is my way to reach them .
to reach people , you have to feel something first . . . you write about the wrong things . how can you feel for dog food ? the people at the gazette do not respect it , and neither do you .
this is a ghost town . nothing ever happens .
are you firing me ?
you going on a trip mr . parker ?
yes .
where ?
when are you leaving ?
i am walking there kris .
walking where ?
the hairs on my arm are standing up . . . something strange is happening .
phileas fogg ?
. . . round the world in eighty days . . . . hello kris .
you are amazing . . . what are you doing mr . parker ?
you are walking to california ?
pacifica , california it is a coastal city .
ellen told me that she did not know if i loved her .

this is the home of an angel .
you ok out there ?
you ok ?
of course . wow . . . you look extremely beautiful .
thank you . what time is it ?
i am rambling . i really like you . you make me want to talk . . . i do not know what time it is .
i like hearing you talk . if you feel up to a short walk , there s a place to eat around the corner . all the food in vegas is terrible so the place does not really matter . how does that sound to you ?
i am from the east . i went to college , did an arts course . i now live in vegas . i think of it as home . i came here deliberately to carve out a life . i was in la before , but i will come back to that later . the tough times are behind me now . i can deal with the bad things that happen . there will always be dark characters . but my life is good . it is as i would want it to be . so , why are you a drunk ?
is that really what you want to ask me ?
yes .
well , then i guess this is our first date . . . or our last . until now , i was not sure it was either .
first . it is our first . i am just concerned . so . . . why are you killing yourself ?
interesting choice of words . i do not remember . i just know that i want to .
it was not so important to me . i mean , he never asked me why i was a hooker , and that was impressive . i really liked him . so i decided to just play my part . i mean . . . it is good to help someone once in a while , it is a bonus to being alive , and that was my plan . . . to stay alive . i suddenly came to a decision .
what are you thinking ? are you angry with me ?
ben , why do not you stay at my place tonight ? i mean . . . look , you are so drunk . i like you . i trust you .
that is astonishing . sera , look . . .
let s face it , what the fuck are you doing in las vegas ?
i am going to move to a smart hotel , tomorrow if it will make you feel better . let s talk about tomorrow . wanna do something ?
sure . . . tonight . then please stay at my place .
sera . . . you know i am not much good in the sack .
how long have i been here ?
three nights , two days . when is your rent coming up at the motel ?
i do not know . i will go and sort it out today . why do not you come ? . . . we will find a real room for me . you can pick it out , a tower on the strip .
there s no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room .
what do you mean ?
what i mean is that you should bring your stuff over here . we are spending all this time together . . . what the fuck !
sera . . .
let s face it , ben , we are having fun here . i have never done so much talking in my life .
me neither .
so ! let s dispense with the formalities . i want you here . . . now !
sera you are crazy .
so . . . i am not too concerned with long term plans .
do not you think you will get a little bored living with a drunk ?
that is what i want . why do not you go and get your stuff ?
do not you like me , ben ?
sera . . . what you do not understand is . . .
you can never . . . never . . . ask me to stop drinking . do you understand ?
hi !
why do not you go in and sit down . i have some gifts for you .
want a drink ? great nap . wanna go out tonight ?
seriously , ben . . . i need to keep pretty low key around here . maybe next time you could nap this side of the door . that was the landlord .
ben ?
sera , i love that name . . . s . e . r . a . before we proceed onwards , there is something i need to say . ok ?
ok .
why ?
because . . . it is better for me that way . ok ?
sera . . . i hope that you understand how i feel about this . first of all , you are welcome to my money . we can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest . but i do not think you are talking to me right now about money .
no ?
no . i think you are talking about you . i will tell you right now that i am in love with you . . . but , be that as it may , i am not here to force my twisted life into your soul .
i know that . . .
. . . and i am not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life . we know i am a drunk . . . but that seems to be all right with you . and i know that you are a hooker . i hope you understand that i am a person who is totally at ease with this . . . which is not to say that i am indifferent or that i do not care . . . i do . . . it simply means that i trust and accept your judgement . what i am saying is . . . that i hope you understand that i understand .
thanks , i do understand . i was worried about how that would be . . . but now i am not . and you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job .
ah , yes . . . i suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck .
right . . . the suitcase was clinking . so what did you do with your clothes ?
i threw them into the garbage , which was perhaps immoral , but i wanted to come to you clean , so to speak . i thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day .
i am going to fill it right now .
giving you money makes me want to come .
i am planning to go out and do some work .
when ?
i like women who wear mismatched earrings .
well , then . . . i hope we do not run into any tonight .
what do you mean ?
how are you doing ?
very well . . . umm . . . i never expected to have to ask you this again . . . but how did our evening go ? i remember getting to the casino . . . i remember kissing you . . . that was really nice but everything after that is a blank .
well i was prepared for worse , but it was not so bad . we were sitting at the bar , talking about blackjack . you seemed just fine , a little drunker than usual , but nothing really strange , but then your head started to droop and i put my arm on your shoulder and then , wham , you swung you arm at me , and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress . you smashed everything on her tray , it was a real mess . you kept yelling and yelling .
oh , and what did you do ?
i tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me not like you wanted to hit me , but more just waving me away . security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling . they wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street , but i talked them into letting me walk you out .
that is impressive . how did you do that ?
i told them you were an alcoholic and i would take you home . i also promised that we would never come in there again .
you were ok for a while , so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck , but i think even you knew that was not going to happen . we got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store , even though i told you that we had plenty at home . in the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change . i asked you if you knew it was a hundred . you said you did , so i let you do it . we got here , you fell asleep on the couch and i covered you up and came to bed .
i warned you . . . . . . but i am sorry .
here s my speech . . . . . . i know this should not be acceptable to me , but it is . do not ask me why . i sense that your trouble is very big . . . and i am scared for you . . . and so i am doing what i think you need me to do . falling down in casinos is little stuff . it does not bother me . it has nothing to do with us .
why do not you go back to sleep . i will go out and buy us some breakfast .
very creative . now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers .
your color .
what was that all about ?
can we just forget it ?
i do not understand any of that .
please !
yes . . . i will give you that .
thank you , sera .
do you want me not to go tonight ?
maybe i should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it is like to sleep with you .
i will be back home around three . if you are back by then we can watch tv or something . . . i guess what i am saying is . . . that i hope you are back when i get home . please be careful .
you be careful to . i am going to miss you .
shall we go away for a couple of days ?
years ago , in la , i turned a trick on sunset and western . the guy was polite and did not argue about the price . he parked his car and i took him to a house that i had an arrangement with . a fat mexican woman was watching a tv and i told him to give her the twenty for the room . there were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room . the room had a bed and a dresser . he lay on his back on the bed and i put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then i eased on to him . about twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up . i felt kind of guilty because he had not come and i offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes , but he said it was all right and began dressing . when we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and . . . hugged me and kissed me on the cheek . he gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car . i remember being relieved that i would not have to work again that evening .
last spring i happened to walk past a house that i had once patronized . there was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window i could see a bare leg . the girl must have been taking a break between customers . it was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that i was late for something already i just stayed there , loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and . . . the reason i am telling you this epilogue is that i felt that i would come full circle .
where was that house ? the one in la , i mean .
fifth and mayflower . you know it ?
i like it here with you .
let s stay for a while .
i have missed the best sun . why did you have to pawn your watch ?
maybe it is time i moved to a hotel .
and do what . . . rot away in a room ? we are not going to talk about that . fuck you ! i will not talk about that . you are staying here . you are not moving to a hotel .
will you lighten up , please ?
there are limits .
i wanted to see you . . .
you know i love you . . . yeah ?
hey , brad . . . how is it going ?
hey ben . there were a couple of guys looking for you .
what did they look like ?
how would this happen ?
i was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up .
the news is not good , kid . this bit here . . . see there . . . it is broken . you need a new one .
how much , do you think ?
about ready for another drink ?
yes , that would be great . are you her for the convention ?
so . . . are you alone , or are you just using me to make someone else jealous ?
alone . alone . i am here alone .
where are you staying ?
right here at the hotel . why ?
well . . . i thought you might be looking for a date .
a date . what , are you a hooker ? what do you mean a date ? i have got a wife back home . i just came over to talk for a few minutes .
please do not raise your voice . i will not bother you about it again .
i do not want this . yuri , please . i really do not want this . you know i do not like to do groups .
i want this , sera . i need this !
you have been lonely ?
i have been all right .
you have been lonely ?
i am pleased with you , sera . . . how you have moved up in the world . i showed you a glamorous world when i took you off the streets . . . and how you repay me .
where have you been staying ?
it is , after all , sera , my money .
yes , of course . how much do you need ?
where have you been ?
a full night on the street and this is all ?
do not hit me .
yes ? what ?
have you told anyone that i am here ?
go , sera . go . stay at home . i will call you tomorrow .
yuri . . . are you . . .
harvard law school ?
that is right .
but it is a top three school
i have a . .
yes , but your major is fashion merchandising . harvard will not be impressed that you aced history of lycra . what are your backups ?
well , then . you will need excellent recommendations from your professors , a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one seventy five on your lsats .
what alibi ?
i cannot tell you .
you understand you are on trial for murder ?
i did not do it ! i walked in , saw my husband lying on the floor , bent down to check his heart , screamed my head off and chutney and enrique ran inside .
why would i kill my husband ?
insurance ? a love affair ? pure unadulterated hatred ? believe me , the da will come up with plenty of reasons .
i loved him !
brooke , i believe you . but a jury is gonna want an alibi .
were you with another man ?
go to hell .
i will take that as a no .
are we done for today ?
what are you so happy about ? you are on trial for murder .
get up .
what ?
you are fired . i have new representation .
is he always such an ass ?
he is the top defense attorney in the state . of course he is an ass .
but is he an ass that is gonna win my case ?
he is an ass that is gonna try .
he thinks i am guilty , does not he ?
that is not that is important .
i am a delta gamma and i am a huge fan of yours !
you took my class in la . you had the best high kick i have ever seen . are you one of my lawyers ?
are you okay ? you look so sad . . . and so orange .
i am glad it is you and not donovan .
elle , i cannot . you do not understand .
it is so shameful . . .
whatever it is it could save you .
that is just it it would ruin me !
i have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the brooke s butt buster workout .
no !
i am not having an affair with enrique you know a delta gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong ! i just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter
that is going on ?
enrique s gay . i am sure of it .
i got out of the shower , walked downstairs , saw her standing over my father , and called the police .
did she have a weapon in her hand ?
no .
was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon ?
uh , yeah , because the bitch shot him .
was there any evidence that mrs . windham shot him ?
okay ms . windham , when you uh arrived back at the house ? was your father there ?
not that i saw . but like i said , i went straight upstairs to take a shower .
and when you came downstairs , what happened ?
i saw brooke standing over his body , drenched in his blood .
but mrs . windham did not have a gun ?
did you hear a shot fired ?
no . i was in the shower .
so at some point in the twenty minutes you were in the shower , your father was shot ?
but you did not hear the shot , because you were in the shower .
miss windham , can you tell us what you would been doing earlier in the day ?
i got up , went to starbucks , went to the gym , got a perm , and came home .
where you got in the shower .
yes , your honor . had you ever gotten a perm before , miss windham ?
how many , would you say ?
two a year since i was twelve . you do the math .
chutney , why is it that tracy marcinko s curls were ruined when she got hosed down ?
because they got wet .
and if you in fact , heard the gunshot , then brooke windham would not have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs . which would mean that you would have had to have found mrs . windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible . is not that right ?
she is younger than i am . did she tell you that ? how would you feel if your father married someone younger than you ?
dewey newcomb ?
who s asking ?
come again ?
due to the fact that you retained the residence , ms . bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately .
huh ?
all i know is it is not brooke .
did you get it ?
why the hell not ?
what are you talking about ?
good work today , ms . woods .
sit down .
is everything okay ?
you followed your intuition today and you were right on target . i should have listened .
thank you .
i am sorry , but
i think it is time discuss your career path . have you thought about where you might be a summer associate ?
you are hitting on me ?
you are a beautiful girl , elle .
so everything you just said
you are not going up there .
i do . i am not allowing it .
what did you see when you entered the house ?
i saw mrs . windham standing over the body of mr . windham .
was she carrying a weapon ?
so she was distraught that her husband was dead ?
mr . salvatore , do you have any proof that you and mrs . windham were having an affair ?
that is going on ?
donovangs firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he is taking on first year interns .
why did not you call me ?
what ?
we spend a beautiful night together and then i never hear from you again ?
i am sorry ?
for what ? breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man ?
uh both ?
massachusetts supreme judicial court rule .
yes ?
yes ?
would you be willing to stake your life on it ?
i think so . . .
his life ?
i do not know .
you cannot even imagine .
after you went to all that trouble ?
well , what am i supposed to do ? he is engaged ! she is got the family six carat on her bony , unpolished finger .
you are asking the wrong girl . i am with my guy eight years and then one day it is i met someone else . move out .
what would you do ?
i did not even get to go to his birthday party .
no !
what could i do ? he is a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures . i am a middle aged high school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass . happens every day . at least to women like me .
that is terrible !
so , that is this sarah got that you do not ? three tits ?
she is from connecticut . she belongs to his stupid country club .
is she ?
could i be anymore goddamn spastic ? so you are sure , this warner guy is the one ?
you showed up warner in class ? you are supposed to be showing up sarah .
you ready ?
no .
god , that felt great !
look at him . he is still scratching his head .
i feel so bad for her . i mean , she is in jail ! and she is innocent . but i am the only one who believes her . donovan totally thinks she is guilty .
so , this is the only interaction you two have ever had ?
no . sometimes i say okay instead of fine .
have you ever considered asking him if he would like a cold beverage ? or perhaps a neck massage ?
that is the point ? look at me .
good one .
and after they set his nose , he came back for his truck and i offered to drive for him since he was still on pain killers and we spent the whole afternoon together ! he was unconscious for part of it , but it was really fun !
i am so happy for you !
how would it go at the trial ?
great . donovan actually said the words good work , ms . woods . he takes me seriously ! can you believe it ?
you cannot go home !
i am here to see brooke windham .
licensed attorney or family member ?
uh family .
relation ?
i am her sister .
name ?
hi . sarah knottingham .
our group is full .
the idiot speaks .
i believe her , too . i do not think she is having an affair with enrique .
too bad you and i are the only ones .
it is not my alibi to tell
i know . i thought that was very classy of you .
warner cannot even do his own laundry .
i know . he has it sent out .
did you know he got wait listed when he applied ? his father had to make a call .
donovan asked to see you before you leave .
really ?
you almost had me fooled .
what ?
i am a bitch .
yes , you are .
and donovangs a scumbag for coming on to you .
you are pawning the rock ? !
can someone please tell rick that he is not the only sigma chi with a big penis ?
why else would she have flown in from newport ? it is not like she would fed ex a six carat diamond .
too demure ?
i think you should go with red . it is the color of confidence .
what if you know it is not the night ?
i do not know ! everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more serious !
we still love you . sisters forever !
honey , stop ! you have to leave this room it is been a week .
once warner sees me as a serious law student , he will want me back . it is a completely brilliant plan !
but is not it kind of hard to get into law school ?
here . you are gonna need this .
your scrunchie ?
elle , do you know what happened on days of our lives yesterday ?
it is elle ! guess what i am doing right this second ?
power yoga ?
picking out my wedding dress !
what ? !
josh proposed !
keep june first open you are one of my bridesmaids . and give warner our love .
oh , how sweet ! you made friends with a nerdy girl .
speaking of which , can you please put on some party clothes ? you look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a k mart .
hello ! you are like , a lawyer .
do they just put you on the spot like that ? like , all the time ?
the professors ? yeah , they tend to do that . socratic method .
you have stromwell .
did she do that to you , too ?
no , but she made me cry once . not in class i waited until i got to my room , but yeah , she can pretty much shrivel your balls or you know , your whatevers .
neat .
donovan , royalton and levinson .
and make sure you read the footnotes in levinsongs class . that is where all her exam questions come from .
good luck .
do not ask .
okay , if brooke did not kill the guy , who did ?
explain to me why you are so anti brooke .
uh , for starters , she will not give us an alibi
aside from that .
she is completely untrustworthy .
why ?
she married an old man , she is made a living on telling women they are too fat , she hawks her crap on the home shopping network . . .
a he is an old man with a really big penis . b she never told me i was fat . and c victoria principal sells on that network .
and d brooke is obviously hiding something .
but maybe it is not what you think .
you are kind of being a butt head right now .
how do you figure ?
i cannot believe you called me a butthead . no one s called me a butt head since ninth grade .
damn . we cannot see her for an hour ?
mrs . windham vandermark ?
she is not !
how can you still believe she is innocent ?
you are going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment ? she is ly ing .
and you know this for a fact ?
did you see the icky black color of her hair ?
so ?
the what ?
blondes are discriminated against worldwide ! brooke s a blonde , and people are saying she is sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband . if she was a mousy brunette , it would be , oh , the poor widow .
okay , how would it work ?
it would be a full service law firm , by and for blondes , providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas . i mean , think about it name one blonde intellectual role model .
i cannot .
that is a direct result of anti blonde discrimination !
wait hilary clinton .
in that case , maybe heyworth got fellated by a brunette and brooke caught him .
exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty year old man can take ?
what the hell is that for ?
the bags under your eyes . you are an attractive man , but you need to take better care of yourself .
i do not do that stuff .
well , you should if you look good , you feel good and if you feel good , you project joy into the world .
projecting joy is not my job .
you really think i am attractive ?
he is gay ! enrique is gay !
back up . how do you know he is gay ?
hey
whoa why ?
law school was a mistake . getting this internship was a mistake .
so now you are ?
going back to la . maybe i can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the swedish bikini team . no more navy blue suits . no more panty hose . no more trying to be something i am not .
oh , my god !
up for a celebration dinner ?
are you asking me on a date ?
as long as you realize i am not just some man toy you can show off like a trophy .
then , forget it . besides , i have an early class tomorrow .
someone missed you .
is he the only one ?
but i am not positive it is gonna happen tonight
no it is just not me .
i am canceling the mixer . we will blacklist sigma chi .
thank you , serena , but i do not think it will do any good .
oh , he is so over on this campus .
how could this happen ?
i do not know ! i do not know anything any more ! i just need to be by myself .
girls i am going to harvard !
calvin kleings spring line is atrocious . do not you agree ?
almost .
well , hurry up so you can come home ! we miss you !
i miss you guys ! the people here are so vile ! hardly anyone even talks to me unless it is to say something that is not nice . law school sucks !
oh , my god ! i completely forgot to tell you !
what ?
i got bangs !
what are you doing here ? !
you guys i cannot . we are in the middle of a trial .
i wish we could stay longer , but i have a game .

why not ?
yes ? ms . woods ?
i did ?
you are applying for my internship , are not you ?
i do not know
you should . do you have a resume ?
it is pink .
maiden name daniels . you know her ?
amazing how ?
she could make you drop three pounds in one class . she is completely gifted !
his twenty seven year old daughter and the pool boy .
maybe she found him like that .
you do not really believe she is innocent ?
class schedule , map , book list .
has warner huntington checked in yet ?
wait my social events schedule is missing .

you know mixers , formals , beach trips .
there s a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes . does that count ?
you are beautiful .
i am fully amenable to that discussion .
i mean , we are having a lot of fun now but things are gonna be different when i am at harvard . law school is a completely different world . i need to be serious .
of course .
my family expects a lot from me . and i expect a lot from me . i plan on running for office some day .
and i fully support that .
but the thing is , if i am gonna be a senator by the time i am thirty i cannot keep dicking around .
i completely agree .
i am sorry , elle , i just
you are breaking up with me ? ! i thought you were proposing .
proposing ? ! elle , if i am going to be a politician , i need to marry a jackie , not a marilyn .
you are breaking up with me because i am too blonde ?
that is not entirely
then what ? my boobs are too big ?
c mon . let me take you home .
no .
elle , believe me , i never expected to be doing this , but i think it is the right thing to do .
how can it be the right thing if we are not together ?
i have to think about my future . and what people expect from me .
so you are breaking up with me because you are afraid your family will not like me ? everybody likes me !
east coast people are different .
just because i am not a vanderbilt , all of a sudden i am white trash ? i grew up in bel air , warner ! across the street from aaron spelling ! i think most people would agree that is way better than a vanderbilt
i told you , elle . i need someone serious .
what are you talking about ? you are not here to see me ?
no , silly . i go here .
you go where ?
harvard . law school .
you got into harvard law ?
oops ! time for class . meet me after ? on the benches ?
so uh how was your first class ?
good . good .
i am sorry , i just hallucinated .
wow . you are a walking felony .
thank you . having fun ?
now i am .
i feel like we have barely spent any time together since we got here .
that is because i spend all my time with case studies and hypos .
tell me about it . i cannot imagine doing all this and donovangs internship next year .
i did not mean
am i on glue , or did i not get into the same law school you did , warner ?
well , yeah , but
but what ? we took the same lsat , we take the same classes
you look nice .
if you tell him , you will probably make summer associate . who cares about brooke ? think about yourself .
pink ones .
thanks for the backup .
it made me realize something . i am an idiot .
in court . on opposing sides .
are you serious ?
did you ever take mrs . windham on a date ?
yes .
where ?
a restaurant in oakland . where no one would recognize us .
and how long have you been sleeping with mrs . windham ?
three months .
and what is your boyfriend s name ?
she is naked .
so , i hear the tart from california shot heyworth .
well , that is what we are trying to prove did not happen . do you have any reason to believe it did ?
aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial ? she said they humped like gorillas . chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house .
i m sure that was very awkward for chutney . much as it is for me , hearing you tell about it .
but i guess it was not enough for brooke .
why do you say that ?
hovering ?
elle ?
is it a kappa ?
oh , god . what if josh does not think i am serious enough ?
helloo . . . you let him have anal sex with you . helloo . . . you let him videotape you diddling yourself .
that is the thing that always makes us feel better , no matter what ?
let s all go ! road trip !
why ? !
you passed spanish because you gave professor montoya a hand job after the final .
there he is !
why so few ?
fool s magic .
fight s over before it is begun . . . soon the survivors will be in full retreat .
then we smash em ?
you go ? not watch fun ?
we come watch . . . we come watch . . .
nay . this is a private affair , no audience welcome . . . better you watch the dismantling of our enemies . . . and , look you , see the moat is set aflame .
fire moat . . . why do that ?
what ?
dumb magic . giant smash peewee .
always .
we go out , smash em now ?
birdies . . . pretty . . .
we watch . . . good fun . . .
more fun win battle ?
this is another victory , my friends . what began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress .
you go to lady now ?
my generosity is not so large as that .
what do you want with me ?
your love .
your words sting more sharply than your whip .
i speak of love , and you think only of the lash .
you are cruel ! your heartless jesting worse than torture ! how can you speak of love when you see what i am !
i like well what i see . it pleases me .
but i am hideous !
you are magnificent .
grotesque . . . monstrous . . .
on the contrary ! the puling , pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting . now you are splendid . . . a fierce goddess . . . the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful .
you lie ! you wish to humiliate me , as if the form i am forced to bear were not punishment enough !
god protect me .
not from me , surely . . .
you . . . you are a beast !
we are all of us beasts , my dear . only most are afraid to show it .
and you . . . are you not also afraid ?
i am afraid of nothing .
then why hide behind a mask ? you are ashamed !
i know no more of shame than i do of fear . i wear this mask not for concealment but protection .
protection ?
i am a creature of darkness . i require the shadow s solace and the black of night . . . sunlight is abhorrent to me . . . i cover myself completely whenever i venture forth in daylight . . . sunshine is my destroyer .
like some vile toadstool .
i prefer to think , more like the sagacious owl .
do you feed on mice and rats ?
i prefer a plump capon , but will happily serve you rats if they are to your liking .
why have you brought me here ?
to be my bride , of course .
damn you !
when the time s come , you will not need to jump , i will throw you out myself !
do it now !
jack . . . oh , jack . . . help me . . .
your moans seem almost pleasurable , my dear . . . developing a taste for the lash ?
kill me . . . i want . . . so nice . . .
no more . . . please . . .
i can keep a victim alive for weeks . . . months , if i desire it . . . it is an art . they beg for death . . . i keep it just out of their reach . the pain remains constant .
sweet princess , you begin to sound most reasonable .
what do you want from me ?
we will get you cleaned up , find a suitable gown . . . i imagine you will enjoy a good meal ?
oh , yes . . .
a few day s nourishment will see your strength returning .
and then ?
yes ?
what will become of me then ?
when you are ripe for my pleasure , i will enjoy the harvest .
i see . . .
i am pleased you are not troubled by the prospect . . .
do as you wish with my body , you will never possess my soul !
your soul . . . ? why should i bother with such a paltry trifle ?
i do not expect you would understand .
you are a beast !
what was that ? did you hear that ?
it is nothing . my men take great delight in routing the enemy . do not trouble yourself , beauty .
it sounded like it came from the courtyard .
from the parapets most likely . the men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving .
might we watch , too ?
and i with you . . . i never dreamed life held such pleasures . . .
pleasure is for those who seize it ! do you think those insipid , pale skinned mortals will ever know such rapture ?
it is odd . . . when i first found myself . . . changing . . . i was sick with loathing and disgust . i thought i was so ugly i wanted to die . . .
and , now ?
now i want to live forever . i have never felt so strong or happy .
or looked so beautiful . . .
yes . i feel that , too . weakness is what is ugly .
precisely , my darling . your animal strength , your primitive power has surfaced . . . you are what you desire .
to be strong and free . . . that is all i desire .
what you do , boy ? you be velly solly , come here intellupt my sleep .
i did not know . . . i
what ? speakee loud ! no hear velly good .
i said , i mean no harm . . . i thought this as empty tomb .
you come stealee tleasoo ?
oh , no , never . . . nothing like that . . . never crossed my mind .
no need lie , boy . i no hurt you . do i look like i wanna hurt you ?
well , er . . . no . i mean , you do not look like dragons i have heard of .
course not . i no flum here . i come flum cathay .
cathay ?
country fa fa away . to the east , beyond the lising sun . . .
east of mercia ?
you got no idee . people there lookee diffelent speakee diffelent . nothing the same . in my countlee i bling good luck . makee lain and thunder .
you do not ravage the countryside , devouring maidens and burning the crops ?
dlagon not like that . dlagon is spilit of life . . . spilit of stlength and goodness .
then you will understand my quest . an ogre named blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn . the world outside is cursed , plunged into eternal winter . unless i return the alicorn , the earth will be frozen forever .
flozen foleva not good .
it is terrible .
ang how you do it ? how you rift cuss ?
i need your help . in order to fight blackheart , i must wear the armor of achilles . i
you come stealee tleasoo ?
no , wait . . . please . . . listen . . .
friend ogg . excuse our enthusiasm , occasioned as it was by a fondness for you .
honeythorn gump , is it ? i have not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragongs tears .
well , bygones are bygones , i always say .
or was it the time you and jimmy squarefoot stole the golden apples i would forged .
twas jimmy done that , i merely stood for the blame unfairly . . . but , here now , ogg , this be no time to rehash old differences , i have friends along in need of safe haven for the night .
who might these friends be ?
baron couer de noir is a blight gainst all nature . we dwarves be not fighters still we are with you in this battle . some of our handiwork may be of assistance .
we be honored , friend ogg .
so , jack . . . think you be a green man and not know gump .
gump , is it ?
aye , honeythorn gump , come to serenade you , jack . . . come to make you dance .
i am in no mood for dancing .
oh , but you will be , jack . . . think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a dancing ?
faerie ring ?
no ! tis not the time ! i want no part of your frolic .
enough !
and how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk ? is me music not to your liking ? mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure .
no . . . i . . . i need to rest .
you will have a long , long rest in the tomb , me lad .
i meant no disrespect .
did not you now ? well then , answer me this riddle and all be forgiven .
and if i cannot ?
it is bluebells !
what !
damnation ! codfish and cockles ! gammon and trotters ! you have bested me , jack .
a riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you are thirsty for wine .
you be our guest , jack .
i am honored , honeythorn gump . . . but no more tricks .
you have me word , lad . to answer a faerie riddle deserves as much .
twas the princess lili gave me the answer . . . have you seen her , by chance ?
i have laid eyes on no mortal but you this day , jack .
i fear she is lost .
why , jack lad , she likes you , is all . and what hot blooded hero would not welcome the affections of a fair nymph like oona here . . . ? if your blood runs so cold , boy , you be a corpse before your time .
elderberry wine . no finer drink under heaven .
it looks . . . er , delicious . . . such a fine bouquet . . . very aromatic . . .
are ye afraid of me wine ? did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the wee folk ? think if ye sup with the faeries you will be enchanted ?
well . . . i . . . i do not want to be rude , but . . . it is generally known that
generally known ! what general ever knew more than to lace up his boots ?
please do not misunderstand . i am grateful for your hospitality and
but . . . but , why ?
big question that , lad . why what ?
why has this happened to the world ? why is it winter now , and dark ?
aye . honeythorn gump would be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer .
do not you know ?
that much magic i can offer ye , a small measure of entertainment at best . making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers .
then , that is gone wrong ? why did it happen ?
if ye want more tricks , i am your man , but for big questions ye must go elsewhere .
do not you care about that is happened ?
course we care . what good s the world locked in a season of death . frozen up , no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer s night no babies to tickle no more spells to cast . . . think that is an enjoyable prospect ?
there must be an answer somewhere .
true . . . but it will not come easy or free . if ye want to ask , ask jenny greenteeth .
someone worthy of respect , lad . she be a water spirit , lives in a bog down at sea side . hideous creature to look at , even by my doubtful standards devours little children , she does , when she can catch them .
how is it this hag knows the truth ?
think there be truth only in beauty , lad ? if you have the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws , jenny greenteeth has the answers you seek .
will you lead me to her ?
are we here ?
aye . that foul wallow be where jenny greenteeth dwells . oona . . . lure her out . play the part of a girl child .
what do i do ?
here now . toss her this when you have the chance . jenny greenteeth cannot resist the sight of herself in a glass . she is terribly vain . praise her beauty and you will lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle .
and if she thinks me a liar ?
the princess is dead .
lamentable news , jack . . . but tis the fate of the living concerns us now .
did you hear ? twas the killing of the unicorn caused it .
aye . black barongs mischief .
if the horn be restored the curse is ended .
time for a champion . can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird s nests , jack ?
i will do what i have to do , for princess lili s sake !
bravely spoke . you have the heart of a champion , true enough .
twill take more than heart . where do we find the armor of achilles , for a start ?
there it be , lad . the lindfarne mound . kings long forgotten lie there , lost in their final sleep .
have we turned grave robber , then ?
a tomb it once was , boy , and a tomb it may yet be . . . there s another in residence at lindfarne now .
and who might that be ?
so i am to be a dragon slayer , is that it ?
now , jack lad , no one s asking ye to skewer the worm . even st . michael would have a job on his hands for all that . but the serpent hoards a pile of booty , achilles armor among his treasures . . . if we find our way within the mound and him asleep . . .
better pray the worm s a sound sleeper , jack .
you do the praying . i have work ahead .
there s the spirit , lad . if ye run into trouble , give a yank here and we will haul ye up .
that is left of me . . . how do i recognize the armor of achilles ?
there be no finer victuals than worm flesh , lad .
by the grace of god .
i believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield . surely st . michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven .
shhhh !
what is it ?
pregnant , is she ?
damn them !
do not see why i cannot ride , too ! i am second in command , damn it !
the colt s still too small .
i am small . . . and i can make myself smaller still . . . small as a bee ! small as dust . . . ! want to see me do it ?
we have no time for tricks this day , honeythorn gump .
tricks , is it ? why i will trick ye ! ungrateful whelp ! i will sour your milk and bird droppings will fall from the sky wherever ye walk .
save your mischief for the black baron .
aye ! that too .
you will need more than bird droppings for blackheart .
i will drop a cow on the knave !
fine looking army .
we march on castle couer de noir within the hour .
how do you plan on finding this here castle , if ye do not mind me asking ?
a true and troubling question , gump . . . we will start from where the unicorn was killed . the baron must have left a trail .
track the demon to his lair .
we must follow that bird .
whatever for ?
jenny greenteeth said follow the raven in her flight . . .
aye . said to follow it to the edge of night . but is this the right bird ?
i am sure . it spoke to me .
birds speak to me all the time . what did it say ?
beware .
how do we follow a raven we cannot even see ?
send oona up above the tree tops . she be our eyes .
this is ogre s magic .
blackheart ?
aye . he is enchanted the lot of them . his reward for delivering the unicorn .
foul fellow , this couer de noir .
the foulest . mayhap i can cut them free .
worse than the battlefield .
what know you of fields of war ?
there . . . it seems to quit . . . i will wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing .
well . . . if the knight be already dead what harm is there in . . . borrowing a thing or two ?
oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance .
good .
twould appear other travelers precede us .
nay , jack , tis not what you are thinking .
i trust our own welcome will be more hospitable .
and this ? some of their handiwork ?
nay . that is but to distract the casual visitor . a dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly .
better to kill than be disturbed .
your imagination runs away with you , jack . . . those bones be but battlefield gleanings , like i mentioned . a wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited .
nice piece of work .
my god ! look !
something the matter ?
shhh ! not so loud , mayhap he will hear ye .
dwarves be very sensitive about their feet .
certainly understandable .
i should hope not !
i pray always to be worthy of it .
do not let this talk of heroes upset you , jack . sigurd s sword is no great thing . the volsung killed fafnir . you killed lindfarne . that is one worm apiece . . . i would say you and sigurd were neck and neck .
we are not in a tournament , gump . ah , but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons . . .
tis not the sword that counts , but the man what swings it . rest easy , jack .
god protect you , honeythorn gump .
make haste ! we have a hard day s march ahead .
. . . this rate . . . we will all be in our graves . . . fore we reach the barongs fortress . . .
we will surely be in our graves if we do not .
god s blessing .
what make ye of that , jack ?
wait !
archers ! bring down that spider ! i will deal with this other creature . . .
is she . . . dead ?
no , thank the lord , but she be sore envenomed by the spider s bite .
we are blind now . oona was our eyes and ears . how do we find the castle couer de noir without her ?
we will find it .
easily said . . . the raven passed this way hours ago .
heading true north . we continue in that direction .
never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course .
we will trust in faith , gump .
why not admit it , honeythorn gump . we have lost our way entirely .
long as we do not lose heart , jack . . .
we will never find the barongs castle .
wait , jack .
hold , jack ! do not strike !
nay . i show no pity to imps and fiends .
aye . we be on a quest to set the world aright
can we trust him ?
never felt so cold in all me born days . . .
do not like the feel of it , jack .
give in to despair and all is lost .
it feels wrong , jack . . . like a trap .
there s more than one way to spring a trap .
that be so , better you pinch yourself now , jack .
on the morrow i will be awake enough to see if dreams come true .
tells you something about him what lives there . . .
we will need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders .
why not mine the damned walls ?
a fine mess this is . . . horrid , nipping creatures . . . what do we now , jack ?
defend ourselves . we have bested far worse already .
easily spoken . . .
do not loose heart . . . assemble the archers . have everyone not holding a shield man a bow . shoot the damned things as they fly .
there are not enough arrows .
water does not burn . . .
and frog do not fly and bite like tomcats . it be magic , jack . . . powerful ogre s magic .
there is not much time !
been telling you that all along , lad .
what magic have we on our side ?
faerie magic s no match for a sorcerer s power . . . we have ogg s gifts , the key and the
that is it ! the unbreakable line ! we will tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis . . . then , i will climb up and chop down the drawbridge .
will you chance a miss ?
one more turn . . .
have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory ?
aye . before the wee pesties attacked .
then it is godspeed , screwball .
he will be atop the portculis ere long .
best get down close to the moat , lad .
aye . we are good as inside .
jack ! the courtyard s been taken . . . the barongs forces are besieged in the south tower . no sign of . . . jack ? do you hear what i am saying ? we have won , lad .
it does not matter .
nonsense ! course it matters .
she is sore hurt , jack , tis true , but not dead yet .
the wound is mortal .
nay . you have not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine .
can you save her ?
easily . . . the question is , can we save ourselves ? be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war .
i do not . . . understand .
the baron hides in the dark in a passage under the castle . . . quick , give me the dwarf s key . . . the one which opens any lock . . .
in the dark , lad ? why should he do that ?
because sunlight will kill him . quickly now , give me the key .
sunlight , you say ?
aye . hurry now , gump , the key !
mean you to seek him out below ?
i am not afraid of the dark .
the kitchen be the most important room in a palace , for if the victuals ai not right , little else is likely to be so .
did you bring me here to sup ?
nay , lad , we are here to collect a weapon you will need fighting the baron .
what weapon ?
sunlight .
plan on carrying some away in a kettle ?
will you explain that is going on ?
hey ! stop it ! i cannot see .
cannot we move any faster ?
seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead . . .
do not get too far !
he is getting away ! he was at my mercy !
never show mercy !
ever wondered why jenny greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth ?
ride like wild fire , jack .
he will not escape me .
a good day for singing . . .
i have not heard a note out of you .
not in the mood , i am afraid .
listen to him . not in the mood . . .
on a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen . . . a day so fair as forty springtimes
i am not denying it is a joyous day
where is your joy if you cannot sing ?
were the princess lili to join me i would sing till my lungs burst !
she lives . . . is not that worth singing about ?
the quest s at an end and where is the good of it ? a faerie festival over a pile of bones ?
tis not the wound , that is sure . not a scar remains . . . we are talking about a spell harder to repair than sword work .
i will do anything . . . face any challenge !
might not need a gesture quite so grand . what were you doing the very moment the barongs curse fell on the world ?
i was with the princess .
where ?
by the pond . she was teasing me .
go on . . . go on . . .
she tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it . said she would marry me if i did .
and did you ?
nay . it was lost . when i came up for air the pond was frozen over .
you must find the ring . . . it completes the cycle answers the riddle . . .
i will try .
keep me belly full , jack . kill us another worm .
hush up , screwball . do your own worm sticking if you like the taste so well .
well done , lad . stout heart .
barely living , from the looks of it .
you see ! you see !
ogg lives there . . . ! and thurgis !
we seek to undo the curse .
well done , lad .
look at that shot ! three at once ! i cannot miss !
sweet slippers of oisin !
someone like floki . . . or squarefoot . . . or
aye . . . my lord . . .
start acting like you are worthy of this mission . . . here . whatever you do , do not dare drop it .
nay , sire , i will cling to it as to life itself . . .
how are these ?
dolt !
greetings , my lady , the green wood is honored .
these for me ?
you promised !
never .
but you did . . . you did !
i may have said perhaps . . .
liar !
it is my father , gone a hunting . the baron couer de noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport .
sport , indeed .
the baron is a frightful man . they say he is an ogre . he wears a mask so none may see his face .
blackheart . aptly named .
oh , fie . what about the unicorn ?
unicorn ?
a promise is a sacred oath .
let s rest a minute . i am so thirsty .
stop complaining .
a gentleman would offer water .
only were he a fool to boot . see yon viper ?
i detest serpents .
that viper has envenomed the water . no animal will drink here now .
what shall we do ?
oh , dear .
that is the matter ?
i have lost my napkin . it was all elf work and lace . . . i must have dropped it when you startled me so .
i will go search for it .
do not leave me now . i fear the unicorn will not show himself without you .
i am not its master .
the napkin will keep . i would rather not be alone .
how much longer ?
shhh !
i am a princess . you have no right to order me about .
such grace . . . and their smell it is ambrosia .
they rival the angels of paradise .
oh jack , might not i touch one ? it would thrill me so .
are you honest ?
jack !
tis a fair question . if you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap .
he will not flee if i show myself ?
not if you be chaste . tis an awesome test of virginity .
i have no fear of failure . your implications are most unbecoming .
where are you going ?
what happened ?
i do not know . they have hurt the unicorn .
who ?
my father and the baron .
damned hunters . it was a trap , and you were the bait !
i did not know . . . i did not . . . it was so lovely . . . he was in my lap like . . . like a baby . . . and . . . i . . .
they tricked you .
my own father . . .
how bad was the unicorngs wound ?
it happened so fast . he was hurt and ran away .
he did run ?
oh , yes , and the mare with him .
there are many would pay a king s ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood .
i do not want it on me .
its powers are strong .
i do not want to be reminded of what happened .
not even the birds sing sweet as you .
jack . . . green jack , you must not flatter me so .
tis the truth .
a maid must beware of flattery . . . methinks you want to kiss me .
there s no happier thought under heaven .
if i were your bride , would the kissing ever stop . . . ? do you wish to marry me , jack ?
my lady mocks me .
nay , jack , i am but wary of your intentions .
my heart intends no more than that you love me as i do you .
i am afraid it may storm .
let it . have not you a cozy bower we might hide in ?
tis not fit for a princess .
be it fit for your wife , green jack ?
i have no wife .
then , perchance you will me .
if wishes were horses even beggars would ride .
do you wish it , jack ? wish you this our wedding band ?
lili ! no !
what have i done ?
i thought you were dead . . . i
i was bewitched . . . it is better this way . . .
no ! i will not let it happen . . .
you have freed me , jack . . .
it is the barongs damnable work ! too cowardly to stand and fight . . . he used you to save himself .
no . . . it is not you he is afraid of , it is . . . light . . .
what ?
sunlight . . . it destroys him .
sunlight ?
that is why he goes masked during the day . . .
so , he is hiding in the dark . . .
in the dark . . . where i join him . . .
no ! do not let go . . . you must not ! i love you !
oh ! green jack ! what a dream i have had . . . proper nightmare .
sweet jack . i am so sorry you found me asleep . do not know what came over me .
i cannot have been under much more than a minute .
seemed like weeks and weeks . such a terrible dream . . . i could never tell you . . .
is what you said about the ring but another dream ?
oh no , dearest jack . . . i meant every word .
nay , dearest jack . . . you are to be my husband . i want none other .
but . . . i am a green man . i have no title , nor lands . . . scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body .
you wear your weeds as well as golden armor , jack . like a true prince . . . a champion !
lili . . . i love you !
that is the matter ?
ouch ! something s biting me .
biting you ?
pinching me !
pinching ? where ?
everywhere ! ow !
i cannot see a thing .
nor can i . damn ! it is buzzing all around me . ouch ! i can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear . . . says its name is oona !
oona ? do you suppose it is a faerie ?
honored to make your acquaintance .
grand champion , is it ? and what great cause leads you to me ?
we seek the ogre , baron couer de noir . he slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter .
step lively now !
sigurd s sword . . .
that is this now ?
i bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness . . . for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty .
well spoke , boy . you have discerning taste for one so young . . . just who might you be ?
they call me green jack , ma am .
come closer then , jack , that i might give you proper thanks .
think me fair , do you , jack ?
the moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you . . .
the moon is too round of face , methinks .
the sight of you makes flowers seem like dross . all the heavenly angels must envy your grace .
i like well your conceit , jack . tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world .
aye . and it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here . i entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow , most lovely of the lovely .
dear lad , what does winter bespeak but death ? it is a time of mourning . this calamity is a curse . something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world .
a unicorngs been slain . the last stallion in all the country .
here be the death weapon the unicorngs blood dry upon it .
couer de noir ! a demon if the devil ever made one .
he chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot .
that would be the barongs way . there will be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished .
how do i get the horn back ?
you will need the fastest steed alive , for couer de noir s castle rests at the very edge of the earth . only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of achilles will protect you from his fury .
where do i find the barongs castle ?
follow the raven in her flight , follow old black wing to the edge of night . . .
not very precise directions .
come sit beside me , sweet boy , and i will draw you a map .
nay . tempting as your invitation be . tell me one thing more .
ask away , sweet man .
what became of the princess ?
princess ? i know of no princess .
princess lili , godwings daughter . she was with me when calamity struck , but after i could find no trace of her .
is she fair , this princess ?
exceeding fair .
as fair as me ?
twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky .
she is dead !
no !
dead , dead , dead .
i do not believe you .
this is sad news , be it true .
do not be sad , jack , not with me here to give you cheer .
tis not the time to speak of cheer .
you will visit again ?
as a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom .
courage , jack .
this is not the time for squabbling .
were i a mortal girl , jack , methinks i would be in love with you .
then i would kiss you without turning my garments inside out and sewing bells all over .
such a sad world , be there no unicorns to brighten it .
never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday .
then , tis not for chastity ? methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night .
i live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand year old oak . my bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins . there s no need of weaponry to keep the maids away .
i am partial to oaks , as are all faerie folk . may not i come visit sometime ?
i would be honored .
only that ?
and charmed , of course .
fie ! do not speak of charms . i should charm you for being so dull witted .
i had no thought of offending you , oona .
do i not please you , jack ?
in every way .
and am i not fair ?
wondrously so .
then why do you speak sweeter words to jenny greenteeth ?
that was in jest .
jest with me then .
how so ?
tell me i am fair , as you did the hag .
you are fair as the first new flower of spring . . .
and sweet ?
sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind .
nay , oona , tis not possible .
a faerie s love makes anything possible .
i am promised to another !
oona . . . do not cry . . . please , you must not . . .
you . . . you . . . you mortal you !
please . . .
why should i feel such pain ? should be the other way round . . . i could vex you . . . make you dance your life away . . .
what care i for the human heart ! such a soft , spiritless thing it is . i prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves fierce and free and keen as steel !
and as barren of love as stone .
i would build a wall around me with such stone , so the likes of you might never enter .
be fair , oona .
is this a may day pageant ? are you all off on a lark . . . ? the raven passed this way hours ago !
heading north still ?
the fastest in the world .
what do we do now ?
that is she doing ?
i am in your debt , screwball .
praise be to god .
master jack ! master jack ! these woods are alive ! they are alive !
where ?
up ahead !
what can you steal from a man already lost his life ?
what care the bones when the soul is free ?
maybe there s a better idea . . . what about birds . . . get a lift from some friendly bird . . .
have not heard a bird sing in days . . .
hello , jack .
sorry , jack .
your fond wishes give me strength , dear friends .
each fit for a hero . . . my uncle fashioned a hammer for thor . twas he named it mjolnir . grandfather forged excalibur . . . you will not ever see finer craftsmanship .
how came you by this blade ?
the avatar . i like the sound of it .
uhm . . . fine work .
achilles wore it before the gates of troy .
you are with us in battle .
no hurt jimmy , sir . . . oh no , please , sir . . .
is he a friend , then ?
forgive my blood haste , jimmy squarefoot , but i want no more surprises from couer de noir .
lost ?
much good we do the world , for all our noble quest . . .
simple as that , eh ?
castle couer de noir built with magic . . . simple as death . . . strong as hate . . .
can you show us the way ?
to castle couer de noir ?
there will be spoils aplenty if you guide us there . once we breach the walls , help yourself to all you can carry .
let that be our problem , just get us there .
it be the castle . . . we feel the castle . . . it be that close . . .
a castle s but stone and mortar
plenty treasure inside . . . jimmy seen it once .
you have been inside ?
in a dream .
marco !
what are you doing ?
dad s disappeared !
and we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then george taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color i liked best ! and he said he loved me !
we did a lot of the wiring too .
are you going to see sam again ?
you can go back to bed . . . or lois might let you go swimming .
i wanna be with you today .
oh , honey . there s not much to do there . i mean , it is all work .
i woke up this morning at three and could not fall back asleep . everyday i think i see more of sam than i have seen in years .
did you know him before you knew dad ?
and video games after !
that is how you get things right is to always try and never give up . huh , mom ?
he is not there .
he is here . check the bathroom .
when does george get to come see his house ?
that is that for ?
mom said i should .
oh .
so put your plans of my room in the trash .
he has not called ?
do you guys feel like painting ?
what color ?
red .
mom ?
i put him to work .
i could not get it to go down .
and why was the alarm on ?
oh . . . i set it to see if it would work .
you would better call and cancel .
what are you doing up so early ?
i could not sleep last night .
why ? what do you mean ?
i am going to bed .
i would be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom .
atonement .
sorry i got you into trouble .
he must .
he seems lonely .
are you his friend ?
no .
why ?
alyssa .
why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage ?
i am living here while i build another house .
do not you have school ?
that is today ?
my keys .
i had them in my pocket .
can you keep sam straight ?
he is not gay . i found out purely by accident , believe me .
i mean drugs . i thought you said he was ?
he would not use around me . i do not like any of it .
you are a good girl .
you have to ask like that ?
i want you to try something with me , okay ?
did you feel anything ?
my mother would die .
it is not what i was expecting .
what did you think it would be ?
i am hungry ! where is my dinner ? who ate my dinner ? huh ? who s in trouble now ?
hey .
they are trying to make me spend the summer here . i am leaving in the morning .
where to ?
i am supposed to be in tahoe .
your dad s really gonna build his house ?
i do not know .
you should stay .
i do not know .
where is your dad ?
he jumped into the ocean .
he is a freak .
you look better without make up .
i cannot even take a shower here .
come over to my house whenever you want . i will tell my mom .
i might not stay , anyway .
i will get your back .
do you remember me from when you lived here ?
yeah .
your dad dated my mom after her divorce .
really ?
i wanted him to marry her .
why ?
josh and i are going to south coast . wanna ride ? maybe see a movie ?
huh ?
i can use your mom s .
not really . no . kinda . he got busted ?
really ?
he asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars .
this is serious ! i do not have my license . he was my ride .
i have seen lots of people . it is not a big thing for me .
hand me a towel . i am getting out .
i am coming in .
i do not want you to !
we are not gonna do anything .
why are you so stupid ?
why are you so uptight ?
i do not even . . . what do you mean ? i do not even know what that means .
it means i am gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way .
that is the point of this ?
does everything have to have a point ?
are you sure you are totally into guys ?
what are you talking about ?
josh said . . .
i was wondering .
you are driving me crazy ! do you know what it is like trying to jack off in an armoire ?
not really .
you are off , you know ? you are way , way off .
i thought i was helping you .
it would help me if i could kiss you .
no , i do not . . . no . i thought we were just friends .
what you think , you know , does not have much to do with reality . i mean , i hope i am not the first to say that about you .
okay , but then we will just be friends . okay ?
on the handlebars or your shoulders ?
hey , i can get you three hundred cash for two hours .
you hate your father .
if he tricked me into loving him , is what i meant .
you would hate him for the trick .
i do not wanna go .
he asked where you were ! he wants you with him .
where are you ? !
floating to catalina .
you are so nice to let sam use your shower .
why is that ?
just , i mean , well , you are here every single day .
he is at work while i am here .
i guess i would just be jealous if i were him .
well , he does not need to worry .
if my kids and my wife were always at an ex husband s house , i would worry .
he will not leave my room .
will he talk to me ?
this is such a street of whiners .
from tuesday to yesterday , not including monday or today . okay . . . mrs . dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn . the corliss have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your . . . structure .
and of course the beck s , with the . . .
it could have been a squirt gun .
are you guys friends ?
we have known each other since grade school .
i would not want you as a friend .
funny how he is the architect and you are just a loud mouth cop .
mr . dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches .
mr . stevens ?
bob larson . do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen ?
a violation ?
oh , yes .
and if i enclosed it ?
an exhaust system or a window is code .
a sink ?
i hate to ask about a window .
i assume you will fill the . . . uh , window , with glass ?
mr . stevens . one of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height . he is filed to have construction stopped immediately .
it is thirty feet .
i have the permit .
after your last extension request and with design review and the board of adjustment and the appeals to the city council , was there an amended permit ?
that would take weeks .
i am good , thanks .
what are you on ?
pardon me ?
how much weight have you lost ?
oh . . . nothing . thirty pounds . i just have not been very hungry .
how is your wife ?
right . . . she married . . . what was he ?
he buys and sells the world .
peter webber ! right . quite the spotlight on that guy .
i did tell you , did not i ? that i would be ready to start the berlin model today ?
this is not me . we can show clients endless options , change anything in a matter of hours on the computer . but you will not change .
typing and clicking myself to renderings is not why i started building models .
all of us are typing and clicking , george . whether we want to , or not .
i am not .
i have been here twenty years .
maybe that is too long .
maybe . . . ?
oh .
how old are you ?
forty .
class of eighty six ! i did not know you were there .
listen . . . maybe i can get you a year .
i hate this job .
what are you talking about ? you love your job .
then it sounds like i am doing you a favor .
it may sound that way , but i react out of fear . my life has nothing to do with what i like or do not like . you have not been listening , have you ?
i did not know there would be a quiz , george .
for everything .
well , i feel better about this now .
i have got one favor to ask .
what can i do for you , george ?
oh , well . . . those are . . . i mean , we do not get to keep our work . i could maybe ask them if you could choose one . but , you know , frankly george , you were the best . computer models cannot begin to match the beauty you gave yours . they are a part of this firm . they inspire me . i go out there and sometimes just stare at something i have designed . it amazes me . i would miss that too much . look , i may be going out on a limb , but you go out there and look them over , every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you . just run it by me first , just in case , you know . . . but i am sure it will be okay .
thank you .
well , it is the least i can do .
is alyssa home ?
she is out with a friend .
oh . . . do you know when she will be home ?
she did not really say .
sam ?
uh huh .
i did not recognize you !
i am sorry .
alyssa said you do not even have plumbing over there .
thanks for the shower .
come over anytime you need to , sam .
if she is not up , you can use my shower .
thank you .
you are here early today .
is alyssa here ?
it is midnight . that is the matter , sam ?
this has got to stop !
he escaped . he is going back in .
does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your . . . penis in plain view of my sixteen year old daughter ?
there are no windows facing my . . . exposure .
george , this is the third time .
the plumber s due out on friday .
you will have to explain that to the police .
you were the only neighbor i could tolerate .
i did warn you .
i forgot where i put my keys .
hello ?
the whole summer , man . party in tahoe .
i do not know .
it will just be my brother the dweeb on weekends . all we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin , dude . my dad s gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod . income village is the place to hook up with hump .
i will ask .
i never said anything . i have not done anything .
i know what the deal is . josh is a pimp . i am not stupid .
your mom and the boys can drop by anytime .
to check up on me ?
i will be around to check up on you .
why would you be there ?
because i live there .
did you tell him he is spending the summer with me ?
who are you , anyway ? i do not even know you .
you will know me by the time we are through .
i am not going !
mom , tell him i am not going . you already promised me !
i am not going !
you do not have a choice .
your nose ring comes out of your nose . if you have got them in your nipples , they come out , too . and there s no make up at my house . no glue sniffing . huffing . no pills , no grass .
if you hit me , i will call the police .
you have worn out your welcome at this house , sam . i will not ever hit you . this may well be the worst three months of your life , but you have earned it . so , pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck . now .
i will hate you forever .
are you totally insane ? !
probably in the bible .
what are you doing ? !
i warned you yesterday .
do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing ?
no .
i hate turkey .
i want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out .
why ?
it bugs me .
you snore at night . that bugs me . can i take you out ?
i do not know .
i am gonna take a walk . i need some money .
you will have money when you work .
no one would blame me if i left !
i would blame you . i want you here .
i am not doing it !
it will be fine .
why do not you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom ?
i do not beg .
and i do not take a shower in the middle of the yard .
i can promise you complete privacy .
if you had a stupid phone or i could use your truck , mom would give me some money .
i am leaving .
where are you going ?
i do not know .
when are you going to be back ?
i do not know .
well , until you know , you cannot go .
where is it ?
a friend of yours is here .
did you got through my pants ?
i have been using since i was twelve ! you are all so unbelievably stupid . you did not give a shit about anything i did until now !
i will apologize for everything but today . . . today i give a shit .
you are too fucking late .
the gloves on the table are for you .
you cannot make me do a thing .
sit down for a second .
oh , so you are in the big shit now ! child abuse . people go to prison for what you just did to me .
i was holding for someone . that was not even mine .
i will have to pay him back .
i will not ever hit you . i do not want you smaller . i want you to be happy . you are not . not here with me . not home with your mother . not up in tahoe . not alone . not anywhere . you are what i was most of my life , sam . i see it in your eyes . in your sleep . in your answer to everything . you are barely alive .
i am not even listening .
twenty years of hating what you live in . . . what you are . this is the end of it , sam . i am gonna build something of me here that i can be proud to give to you .
do whatever you want with it . i do not care . all i want from you is for you to remember we built this house together .
we have not build shit . you are just tearing down your father .
hi , alyssa .
i took some of your vicodin .
i know . why ?
i know the feeling .
how do you become something you are not ?
what would you like to be ?
what i am not .
what are you now ?
nothing .
that is not true .
see , that is the thing . . . i am what i say i am .
i know parts of who you are .
when you started first grade and your mom went to work , it was so she could save for an apartment . but then she met peter and skipped the idea of renting .
he is got nothing to do with me .
i could not imagine how i could compete with him for any part of you . so , i did not . he wanted you to have his last name . . . i let him even take that .
i wish you had told me then .
i am telling you now .
i gave up on you .
i would be in tahoe having fun if you had given up .
what would you be doing now ?
getting high , i guess .
if i asked you to stop , would you ?
i have not used anything for two days . i am trying .
i am proud of you , sam .
are you talking ?
i was just thinking about my mom . she would not leave him . i remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses . i mean it was dark outside and in . but we never talked about it .
sun glasses ?
to hide a black eye .
why would not she leave ?
i think she was terrified of living with him . . . but maybe even more terrified of life without him .
i would have killed him .
everything would have been better if you had . you would have liked your grandmother . and there would be a girl out there that would have her mother . i remember reading about her in the paper . they could not find her father and her mother was dead . i still feel guilty about that .
i loved him too much .
after everything he did to you and your mom ?
after everything .
dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for christmas lights with a switch inside ?
you look better than ever .
i do not think mom cares that much that my . . . that peter left .
she seemed upset .
i mean , do you need to have surgery on it or what ? because those pills you are taking are for a lot of pain . and you are going through them quick .
are you taking them still ?
i do not know what that means . what kind of problem ?
the kind where there is not really an answer .
i still do not know what that means .
i do not know what that means . what kind of problem ?
the kind where there is not really an answer .
i still do not know what that means .
and you told mom today ?
we are all dying from the start . i just got picked for advanced placement .
you lied to me !
i would have lied to me if i thought i would believe it .
this was all for your sake , was not it ? having me here ? trying to get me to like you .
i never tried to get you to like me . i tried to get you to love me .
i do not wanna go , sam .
i would eat a lot of red meat .
what would you do ?
what kind of house ?
no one s really said four months is all you have , have they ?
stage four pancreatic cancer . they have not even pretended to offer treatment . you tell me , when would you start eating red meat ?
can you build a house in four months ?
good for you .
i am sorry , i do not know what that was .
a handshake , or you know , someone pats you on your back through clothes . doctors , people who have to touch you . but not by people who want to .
no . a friend . . . your mother ? everybody gets touched by someone they love .
i aimed high .
was bankrupt and dead before i was twenty .
left you this place .
it was in my name so he would not lose it . he stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title .
your kid was down around diver s cover again , smoking pot . i did not write him up . . . told him i would not tell you . . .
thanks for telling me .
ah ! oh . . . .
mr . dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house .
i am surprised he has not left .
it is my day off . i thought i would help with the plumbing .
i need you to do me a favor .
god , you look like crap , george .
why do you let your dog crap on his lawn , day after day ?
how many bedrooms will your house have ?
i just wanted to know where mom was ?
oh . sorry .
it is okay .
she needs to be alone , i think .
because dad left ?
she is a little sad , is all .
you should lock your doors .
did sam call to tell you he would not be over this weekend ?
lock the door behind you .
where is he ?
what are you doing ?
he never answers .
why does he have a lock on his door ?
i called everyone , everywhere ! you just vanished ! you could be dead !
thanks for waking me up . picking me up . you are loud today .
you are inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion !
what ?
i did not think you would know i went missing .
you did not think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat ? !
a blueprint spool .
where have you been for a week ? !
four days . i left to think .
what did you do with your dog ?
kurt s been feeding him .
but you cannot call me while you think ?
i need to talk to you .
why would they tow your truck ?
i was parked in day parking .
why call me ?
i am going to tear down the shack and build my house .
you have been saying that for twenty years . while we were dating , you said it .
there s nothing anymore to stop me .
money ?
severance pay . and i am going to cash in my life insurance policy .
how many years did i live with your beams and boards ? first in the garage , then in the living room . we are going to do it , robin . next year . next year . salvaged floorboards from a house in pasadena . doors from a church in new hampshire . . .
i love those doors .
where will you live ?
the garage .
look , i was not serious about you taking sam , so you do not have to get into any actual construction to get out of it .
whengs school over ?
friday . . . god , i hate the thought of him home all day .
i will be by saturday to pick him up .
he does not want to spend the weekends with you anymore .
you and sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer ?
the garage is plumbed . i will put in a toilet . we will survive .
thank you for at least sounding sincere .
sounding ? i need help . he is cheap labor .
one of you would end up dead .
at least we will have a house to show for it .
forget it , really . i will survive .
i want him with me .
hey , hey !
what was i supposed to do ? when you did not show up saturday , i tried to call . your phone is not working .
i do not have a phone .
i drove over and you were gone .
i cannot leave the house ?
last time you were gone for a week !
did you tell him he was spending the summer with me ?
no . i was going to let you do that .
i did say he could go .
george
we are fine . turkey sandwiches .
it makes me sad .
what ?
i used to live here .
but you hated four out of the five you did .
i was here six years . and i only hated two .
which ?
i do not even like turkey sandwiches . what kind of pizza ?
i was up on the roof this morning , tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has . that i am happy today .
what have you been before today ?
it was just that , maybe the way the sun struck the ocean , the sound of the waves . it was simple , whatever it was . then i started thinking about the last time i felt this good . it is been a long time .
do you remember ?
you head was pressed against my chest . i could feel your heart racing . and i remember i kissed your hair .
what is it ?
it is not breakfast yet .
i dreamed about your house last night .
finished or unfinished ?
it was perfect , george . amazing . it was so real .
did not you once dream you could lick people well , though ?
that was not a dream . that was sam .
oh . . . with his ear infection !
go in there and lick his attitude .
i have been wrong a lot in my life .
with your hands or your tongue ?
i thought you would be up with the sun .
do you need anything ? i will go to the pharmacy . i have some demerol at home .
where is sam ?
you brought your kids ?
i kind of said that maybe they could do something . help . i am sorry . they really wanted to come . i really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me . i do not think they will be too much trouble .
i will find something that will not kill them .
or wound . let them keep their eyes and fingers .
do you need help ?
it is been a while .
tell him how you made me fall in love with you .
i smiled at him .
let s see if you have gotten any better .
maybe you should not come everyday .
no . why ? i like to be with sam .
i know they are not much help , but they love coming here , george .
how much time do they get to spend with their dad ?
do you know alyssa thinks something is up with us ? she is giving me crap about being away from peter and now you are trying to do the same thing ! what no one seems to realize is that peter is not there ! he is not there ! and when he is , he is not ! so , if you do not want me here , or you do not want my kids here , just tell me , george . i will stop coming . but it will not be because of peter . it will be because you asked me to stop . say what you need to say , because i am not leaving until i hear it .
i thought we were helping .
nothing is going on with us , is it ?
going on ?
when i picked you up from the train station . . . what you said .
what did i say ?
that thing about i was the most , you know , beautiful person you had ever known . what was that ?
that was the truth .
you have never said that before .
i will say a lot of things i have never said before . it is habit .
it sounded like a pick up line .
i am married .
you bit my finger .
let s not do this , okay ?
i need to know .
is your back still killing you ?
i did not think you would come today .
i kept thinking about it , what you said . . . i hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me .
no . mostly me .
peter left me yesterday .
left you ?
no goodbye . no fuck you . no are you in love with george ?
what did he say ?
back . neck . back .
i could die .
are you going to kiss me ?
do not move !
i better get the kids home .
been thinking ?
it will take you like twenty , thirty minutes .
does alyssa know ?
nothing .
you got any weed ?
that is your deal with alyssa ?
do not even . . . i am there .
i was not sure .
he already knows everything about what he cannot do . you can tell him not to even look at you , if you want .
it is just a joke . a stupid joke .
he said he heard hammering .
what are you talking about ?
what the fuck ?
everything happens for a reason . that is what my dad said .
then you tell me , what just happened ?
i do not have a clue anymore . i wish you would talk to him . he needs a man .
his father is a man .
we have eaten .
is lois still here ? i am starved .
do you think it is odd your kids do not hug you ?
should i ?
if i let everything that should worry me , worry me , i would be dead from worry .
what would you be if you asked adam and ryan to run in now and hug you ?
to shave your chest ?
the biggest waste of time since television .
i would love to drive through new england in the fall .
after the kids are back in school .
i am helping george build his house .
what ?
i have been helping for the last few days . weeks . sam s working . i told you sam was working . i mean , he really is .
i cannot go right now .
you cannot go because of sam ?
we have not been away together for three years . what difference does a few months make ?
you cannot go with me because of sam ?
sam is working at something for the first time in his life . once in a while he even talks to me . i want to be around for that .
i was talking about our marriage .
that sounds pathetic , does not it ?
what are you doing home ?
you never really trusted me .
you live a fabulous life , robin .
despite you .
i never asked for more .
that is the problem .
where are the kids ?
sam took them to a movie .
i hardly recognize you with a beard .
that was my plan . . . to be hardly recognizable to you as me .
thanks for talking about me behind my back . . . useful in court .
no .
do it now !
you do not look like you .
i thought i might be able to help , but it looks like you have all you can handle .
hey .
hey .
you got a dog ?
i have missed you guys .
do you know anything about building a house ?
no .
i guess i could teach you some things .
what are you doing in my room ?
i did not go in your room .
there were no pg s . so i just gave them money to play games .
can you stay for dinner ?
the door was open .
i do not know what i am doing .
you are sure about this ?
yeah .
you could keep it and rent it out ?
this is what he wants .
i read the letter . you read the will . he wants you to keep it . to live in it some day .
run downstairs and give your dad a hug .
why ?
queer .
what did you say ?
why do we have to get up and eat with you this early ?
all day again ?
ryan , would you rather swim or work ?
i brought a few of my own .
adam , that is not true !
yes , it is .
nothing r , okay ?
go tell your father we are eating .
dad s home , already ?
they ai not men , mae rose . they are convicts . and nigger convicts to boot . can you say nigger ?
nagger ?
no , nigger .
nigger .
a night in the hole ?
she will be fine . she just had a bit of a shock .
is mae rose okay ?
she is doing just fine .
and the baby ?
he is a big one .
biscuit , when you are done with jangle leg , you think you could squeeze me in ?
thought you would never ask . biscuit needs some gravy .
i am talking about a haircut .
do not take it so hard , biscuit . she do not mean nothing to him .
these are free papers .
what am i gonna do out there , ray ? i cannot go home to my mama like this . i will get the strap for sure .
it is . it is a different world now .
not for me , it ai not .
we get the games on the radio sometimes .
we played down in jackson yesterday . heard a rumor you have got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton .
you probably mean cannot get right . that is him over there .
cannot get right ? that is the kid s name ? can i talk to him ?
you can try , but you will not get too far . why you interested ?
crawford s are always looking for new talent .
maybe you did not notice , but this is a prison .
yo , blocker , that is going on here ?
kid s getting out . i got him a pardon .
yeah , but what about me and ray ? i did not see our names on that pardon . you said you were gonna put in a good word for us .
look , i am truly sorry about this . i would like to help you . . .
but you cannot .
oh , no , ray . not tonight . spanky s not happy with you .
is spanky here ?
no , but . . .
then that is the problem ?
do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door .
but this is where the action is and i have to be where the action is . look , when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes , did not i come through for you ? ai not she stepping in style now ?
yeah . . .
well , alright then . what do you think about this new tie ?
sharp .
yeah .
my name s yvette . sylvia sent me . you look just like she said .
she is alright , is not she ?
oh , she is fine . she is just not coming today .
why not ?
she got married last month .
married ?
she always said that if you were on the outside . . .
but i am not on the outside . i am in here .
i know she is sorry she will not be seeing you anymore . anyway , she wanted me to take care of you .
take care of me ?
you know , go to the tonk or whatever .
i am too old for you . besides , i am not much in the mood .
want me to come back some other time ?
damn dentures slipping again . everything falls apart when you grow old , eh , claude ? time sure marches on .
yes , boss .
i apologize , claude . that was rude of me .
that is alright , boss . takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings .
you been on the farm for quite a spell , have not you ?
forty years . that is a long time for any crime , even murder .
it is a hell of a lot longer when you are innocent .
half the men in this prison swear they are innocent . do not you think that is kinda funny ?
you know i trust you , claude .
yes , sir .
goodnight , mr . wilkins . mr . pike .
cool it , ray . you are gonna get us in a lot of trouble .
claude , mind helping me to the bathroom ?
sure , boss .
i got it . . . boss .
i do not see no wedding ring , banks . conjugal visits are for married prisoners only .
you think you could make an exception just this once , boss ? she came all the way down from new york .
craddock ! . . . williams . . . henshaw ! . . . banks !
comfortable ?
as a pair of fur lined bedroom slippers , boss .
for the kind of money they charge here , you would think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes .
claude . here s to your new job down at the bank . i always knew you would make something of yourself .
season tickets to the yankees . right there on the first base line . that is wrong , baby ?
engagement ring !
that is what respectable folks do . get a job , get married , start having babies . that is what you want , is not it ?
come on , honey , let s get out of here .
did you go see my cousin maynard like i asked you in my letter ?
of course i did . he said he would file an appeal right away . you did not tell me he was so good looking .
yeah , that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains . i hope he do not mess things up .
he seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me . his offices take up an entire floor of that big , new building on th street , and he was using all these words i never heard before . he even offered me a job .
listen , claude , maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend , too .
ray gibson ? no , no . he is the reason i am in here , daisy . for all i know , he is got a record a mile long . i got a better shot of getting out of here on my own . you tell maynard to think about me , concentrate on me . understand ?
i have never seen you in here before .
that is because i have never been here before .
cannot you remember your own name ?
i know it begins with a c . . .
well , mr . c , how about buying a girl a drink ? two bourbons .
i really should not . i gotta keep an eye on my friend .
claude . that is my name . claude . that is never happened before .
you are cute . you have any money , claude ?
ten dollars . but i need it to get home .
do not i know you ?
i do not think so .
sure i do . that is your name again ?
claude banks .
claude banks . how could i forget that ? you have got to remember me . ray gibson . we went to high school together .
you went to monroe ?
here , this belongs to you . it was empty when i found it .
what i want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when i caught up with you in the johnny ?
i do not see where that is any of your business .
where they taking us , anyway ?
probably to spanky s headquarters down at the pier .
good , i am looking forward to meeting this spanky . give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess .
what are they gonna do to us ?
you ? dine and ditch , right ? over ten bucks ? you are probably looking at a thumb .
come on , daddy o . you have not said a word since we started . least you could do is make some friendly conversation .
look , man , i do not want friendly conversation . i do not want to be your friend . i have seen your friends and i do not like them . i just want to do this thing and get back to new york in time to start my job .
start your job ? what kind of job ?
well , if you must know , bank teller at first federal of manhattan . i am responsible for keeping track of hundreds , occasionally thousands of dollars .
that is some long green .
what ?
nothing .
no , tell me that is so funny .
i do not know . bank teller . sounds like ladies work to me .
well , maybe i should dig around in other people s clothes for money . it is obviously been highly successful for you .
hey , you would be surprised what you find in other people s pockets . just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers . get you every time .
i did not start out to be a bank teller . i was gonna be a ballplayer . even had an offer to play short for the newark eagles .
why did not you take it ?
the negro league do not pay so good . and you are always on the road . that do not wash with daisy .
you gave up baseball to be a bank teller ? i cannot latch on to that .
at some point a mangs got to get serious about his future . i am sure you have no idea what i am talking about .
you are talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller .
bank teller s just a start . i got plans . real plans . not opening some zoom boom room . this time next year i will be a loan officer .
a loan officer ?
that is right , a loan officer .
so you mean , if i needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running , i would have to hype some square like you ?
how would i get a loan , anyway ?
you need collateral .
like this ?
that thing ? who would you steal it from ?
my daddy gave me this watch .
yeah ? who would he steal it from ?
my daddy is dead so watch your mouth . you can say what you want about me , but do not be dragging my daddy into it . this watch means the world to me . solid gold . keeps perfect time .
ah , go chase yourself . i will take my business elsewhere . and for future reference , you are no longer welcome at ray s boom boom room .
there is no boom boom room .
when there is , you can forget about it . and i swear to god , you ever talk about my daddy again i am gonna kick your bank telling , loan denying ass , you got me ?
oooh . . .
maybe we oughta find another place .
are you kidding ? tell me you do not want a slice of that pie right over there .
you mean this sign ? the one that says no coloreds allowed . that is a good question . ray , how come we missed the sign ?
thanks for backing me up here , uncle claude .
do not uncle claude me . you get a load of those crackers ? could not be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of em . why you want to pick a fight with people like that for ?
you are soft .
i said you are soft .
hey , man , do not ever call me that .
alright . you want some pie ?
yeah , i want some pie .
nice meeting you ? you have been here before , have not you ?
what gave you that idea ?
oh , i do not know , maybe because our lives depend on it , i just sort of thought you knew what you were doing !
do not get all agitated on me . i bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes , i heard em talking . . .
let me get this straight . we drove all the way down to klan country cause you heard a couple of guys talking ?
what are you complaining about ? it worked out . everything s cool . now , come on , let s head down there and see that is shaking . we deserve a little reward .
reward ?
hey , ray . i have been looking for you .
here i am .
guess we better get going , huh ?

well , not exactly . see , i met this girl . real nice girl . god fearing girl . her name s sylvia .
that jelly you were talking to right here ?
she is in a tight spot . her mama needs this operation , and they ai not got the money for it . their church took up a collection but they were still short . . .
so you made a generous contribution .
what can i say ? when the spirit moves me .
that was mighty charitable of you , claude . looks like we both got fucked tonight .
what are you talking about ?
while you were upstairs doing god s work , i was getting jack legged by a fool with four threes .
you lost all our money in a card game ?
he even got my daddy s watch .
fuck that cheap ass watch i mean , how the hell are we gonna get home without any money ?
i think he is hurt pretty bad .
he is dead .
what do you think you are doing ? ! the mangs been dead for two seconds ! do not you have any respect ?
it ai not here .
what ai not there ?
yeah , nobody puts em away like old that is his name .
winston . his name s winston .
would you look at that , ray . winston up and died on us .
man , this is gonna delay everything . spanky s gonna be pissed .
spanky s gonna be pissed ? poor spanky . fuck spanky ! what the hell kind of a name is spanky , anyway ? you are responsible for this situation . i blame you for everything . if it was not for you , i would be home having a hot meal right now .
life ? ! how long is life ? we were just walking back to the truck . we did not do nothing ! fuck life !
i would not do that if i was you .
why do you think they call him jangle leg ?
somebody just told me he wins the three legged race every year .
so ?
this fork is filthy .
what a second , you have been in here since you were thirteen ?
i kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night . must have been or twenty not counting women and children . it was a real bloodbath . all that screaming . . .
pack of lies . do not listen to him . we did not kill nobody . we were railroaded . and we gonna prove that .
no , man . i want you to have it .
cookie drew me a map to greenville .
so ?
you know what i am saying .
yeah , i know what your saying . and i am saying if you made it that far , they would be watching every train that pulls out of that station .
that is why we will not take the train . cookie showed me where there s a farm house . they got a boat there .
what i know about boats is they take you to freedom . come on , man . i think we can do this .
you want out of this place , do not you ? do not tell me you are starting to like it here .
no , i do not like it here . look around . there s nothing but ass . male ass ! balls and ass ! believe you me , i am getting out of here .
what does that mean ?
forget it .
i am not gonna forget it . what does that mean ? if you have got a plan , i think i have a right to know about it . i told you my plan .
maynard banks , esquire . attorney at law .
gimme that . that does not concern you .
that is up , ray ?
claude .
sure is hot today . think it will rain later ?
what do you want , claude ?
what do i want ? what makes you think i want something ?
my daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet .
your daddy must have been a helluva guy , a deep man , a wise man . sure wish i could have met him
cut the bullshit . what do you want , claude ?
you still got that map ?
yeah .
well , if you are still thinking about booking it , i want in . i think we can make it .
we ? did i hear you say we ? as i recall , you are the one who said there is no we . guess we got some bad news in that letter , huh ?
look , my cousin maynard is a lawyer . he filed an appeal on my behalf
on your behalf . what happened to we ?
the appeal was denied . then daisy went and fell for maynard . they are engaged to be married , can you believe that ?
well , let s just think about that for a moment . he is a successful lawyer up in new york city and you are down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business . eeny , meeny , miney , maynard .
come on , man . do not shut me out . i am telling you , you and me , that map , we can go places .
no .
at least you are honest for once . so now you want to be my friend ? well , let me tell you something , claude my shit do not stink banks . you got a lot to learn about friendship .
does that mean i am in ?
i do not think so , claude . you would just slow me down . we would have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware . there s no way around it , you are soft .
what would you say ?
i said you are soft .
you did it , man ! you got us out ! next stop , new york city !
i know these trees all look the same , but i am getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here . you sure you know where we are going ?
absolutely . the map is very clear .
you call this a map ? what was cookie smoking when he drew this ?
cookie did not draw it . i did .
you drew this ? !
i knew you would not come if i did not have a map .
come on , ray , time to go !
do not mention it .
hell , you would probably be half way to new york by now . . .
keep it together , claude . you wake up the man , he will shoot you for sure .
all right , man , just settle down . we will get outta here , claude . we will get outta here real soon .
we will just get off at the next stop .
say what ?
that is right , we will get off at the next stop . the traings pulling into the station right now .
the hell you talking about ? what train ?
hundred and sixty first street ? that is yankee stadium .
hell , yes , yankee stadium . bombers are playing a double header against the red sox .
red sox . . . who s on the mound ?
i do not know . who do you want ?
allie reynolds . he is my boy .

i know people .
they must be the right people . whoa , there goes the hot dog man . let s get a couple . damn , that smells good . nothing like a ballpark hot dog , huh ?

ketchup ? who eats ketchup on a hot dog ? mustard s what you want .
give me back that hot dog . i will eat it myself .
what am i gonna eat ?
you can starve to death for all i care . now shut up , the game s about to start .
hey , man , is babe ruth in the lineup today ?
what you are dealing with here is a complete lack of talent .
you want to hit ? yo , claude . give cannot get right a shot .
him ?
cannot be worse than any of these other fools .
judge must have money riding on the championship .
it is amazing what ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses .
what about us ? do not forget to mention us .
god may have given it , but claude banks spotted it and nurtured it .
damn straight . i expect those pittsburgh crawdads to remember that .
crawfords .
it is a pardon from the governor .
let it go , claude .
you show them crawfords how to play ball .
one of the new kids said they are farming those acres just north of the swamp . he said he saw a crop duster flying around the place .
i am not in the mood right now , ray .
he said they keep it parked out behind the barn . cannot be that hard to fly a plane . lots of people do it .
they are called pilots ! i am serious , ray . i am not in the mood for one of your stupid , fucked up plans right now .
i do not see you coming up with any plans .
my plan is on his way to pittsburgh right now . that congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us , but we cannot seem to do nothing for ourselves . do not you feel a little disgusted right now ?
crop duster .
my daddy died in prison . he gave up hope and hung himself . what you are talking about is the same damn thing . that ai not how i am going .
maybe you are fooling yourself , ray . maybe you are just a chip off the old block .
take that back or we ai not friends no more , claude banks .
better watch yourself claude , before you say something you regret .
the only thing i regret is the day i met you .
well , if that is the way it is . . .
that is the way it is .
you are a sucker . i would have taken that deal .
excuse me ? are you talking to me ?
i would have knocked you off those bottles , put a bullet in your ass and be half way to new york right now .
after all these years of blissful silence , i almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be .
i hope you do not think i owe you anything . because i do not owe you a damn thing .
i was sorry to hear about your mama passing .
that was five years ago .
i know , but since we are talking , i thought i would mention it .
what ? !
you sure looked funny running for those pies , bullets flying all around you .
you and wilkins sure are getting chummy . you two planning on going steady , or something ?
he is just a lonely old man . he likes to talk .
hey , i am a lonely old man . i like to talk , too . so why do not we start by talking about what kind of a plan you are working on ?
i am not working on a plan .
you cannot fool me , claude . i know you got something brewing .
what the hell are you doing ?
wilkins driver s got the flu , so he asked me to fill in for him .
you have not driven in years , you ai not even got a license . mangs taking his life in his hands , putting you behind the wheel ! where you taking him ?
damn , it was getting hot in there .
what the hell are you doing in that trunk ? !
you did not think i was gonna let you escape alone , did you ?
i ai not escaping ! we are picking up the new super just like i told you .
then you are lucky i came along . does not take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this . now help me out of this trunk .
you ai not getting out of that trunk .
come on , man , i am starting to cramp up here . we have the chance right here , right now , i say we go !
go where , ray ?
back to new york for starters .
and what will we do when we get there ? i am sixty five years old , ray . so are you . what are we gonna do out here ? get married , have kids , settle down ? that boat sailed without us , man .
this boat s gonna sail without you , too . i do not care if i last one day out here . at least it is one day of freedom . now gimme those keys .
forget about that . you run if you want to , but you are not taking this car .
claude , man , i am serious . give me those keys .
i ai not spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride .
do not make me take them away from you .
you sure it was him ?
some faces you just do not forget . warren pike s is one of em .
i do not like it , i do not like it one bit . we shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity . we would be half way to new york by now .
we would be in the hole by now . hey , man , you are peeing on my shoe .
do not shoot , sir . i can deal with this . ray , buddy , you do not want to shoot this white man . see , you do that , they will kill you for sure . and it is not that i like you or anything , but i have kinda gotten used to having you around .
no , i am gonna kill him
i cannot do it .
that is because you are soft . gimme the gun .
what would you say ?
i said you are soft .
why do not he just tell em the truth ?
nurse humphries was checking my prostate this morning . i got an erection .
an erection , huh ? have not had one of those in a while .
sure would like to see the house that ruth built one more time .
well , ruth shoulda built it a little better . damn thing s falling to pieces . gonna hurt somebody .
what do you expect ? it is almost as old as we are .
they oughta tear that shit down and ship them yankees cross the river to jersey .
over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery . never thought i would admit it , claude , but you were right .
course i was right . about what ?
are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here ?
shh ! is that so hard to believe ?
do not tell me , i do not want to hear it . it is probably all fucked up , anyway .
you do not want to hear it , you do not want to hear it . there s no shame in that .
it is too late for plans .
i cannot eat this .
why the hell not ?
just put some mustard on it and eat it .
you did not get ketchup ?
hell of a day for a ballgame , huh , claude ?
no , this ai not gonna work either . it is half chocolate , half vanilla .
so ?
if you do not eat that ice cream right now , i am gonna strangle you until you are completely dead .
yeah ? you and what army ?
next thing , you are gonna be complaining about the seats .
well , if you must know , they could be closer .
i know you are not talking to me . . .
how you doing ?
i am all right .

then you will not have no problem making the adjustment . you need anything , help of any kind , gimme a holler . name s jangle leg .
soft and supple . like a lady s .
what is that ?
creamed chip beef on toast . except we are outta beef , so i had to improvise .

at least he did not kill santa claus with his bare hands .
alright , well , let s say you make it to greenville . that is there , anyway ?
you got your own nightclub ?
ray , my man , this steak is like butter !
made just for you , cookie .
how about some steak sauce ?
why ai not his pick swinging ?
too hot , huh ? well , you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of mississippi ai not interested in his meteorological assessments .
listen up , jiggaboo ! state of mississippi ai not interested in your . . . in your . . . metropolitan assets !
tell him the state of mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown .
he is from new york city . that one , too .
looks like we got a couple of live ones . how long these boys in for ?
judge gave em the long ride .
we lost yesterday on accounta the rain . that means we gotta make up for it today , so put your backs to it .

that is right , fellas . catch any cab heading uptown . all the drivers know ray s boom boom room .
where am i at , man ?
hey , the dude s holding .
hell of a way to get out . heard they burned up in that fire yesterday .
so ray and claude got their pardons , right ?
no , they did not get their pardons , you dumb shit ! if they would got their pardons way back then , we would not be burying them today , would we ?
that musta messed em up pretty bad .
man , you really bummed me out . that is a terrible story . nigger , you crying ?
what do you think about that ?
why do i get the feeling when you say some time , you mean some time .
i was already here a good many years when they came in in .
? that is like , that is like . . .
ray s special recipe . he always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned .
old man wilkins never came out of that bathroom . died right there on the crapper .
just like elvis .
it is alright for a man to cry once in awhile . just do not make a habit of it .
hey , willie , what was claude s plan , anyway ?
mama ?
what are you doing here , mama ?
i heard some things so i went to see spanky johnson . he told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here . what happened to your face ?
rayford , i wanted so much more for you than this .
do not cry , mama . this place ai not so bad as it looks . sure , we work hard , but there s plenty fresh air and sunshine . . . and you know something else , i have taken to going to church regular . they got services every sunday right there in the mess hall .
i cannot take that , mama .
i cannot believe this . i always said i would never end up like this . i thought i would make something of myself , do something with my life . you know , be successful . have a big house , a family . now i am gonna end up just like daddy .
do not say that , rayford . do not ever say that . he gave up hope . that is where you gotta be different .
they gave me life , mama .
is everyone here ?
hey , where is claude ? i do not see claude !
stay calm , ray . we will find him . claude ! has anyone seen claude ?
wait for the firemen !
it will be too late .
you cannot go in there , ray ! you will never make it !
lemonade ?
i prefer bourbon .
i am sorry , i do not keep any liquor in the house .
hunting s been pretty good on the farm the last few years . it is one of the perks of the job . if you are interested , tomorrow i could show you some of my favorite spots .
you do not have to twist my arm . say now , that gumbo has quite a kick .
if you do not mind my saying , you seem mighty familiar with your house boy .
i believe in treating the convicts with respect , if that is what you mean .
respect ? well , is not that progressive .
that is going on here ?
he is crazy . do not listen to him , wilkins .

i am interested . keep talking .
if you fuck me on this one , i will spare no expense .

if i was you , i would want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot .
adrian !
you should not have come here .
adrian , you gotta come back to hell . dad s sick .
he is sick ?
he should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright .
well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him .
of course i can . drink or she dies . unlike you , she will not come back from where she is going .
let her go .
welcome to the party . it is so nice to see all of you here .
little nicky .
adrian , i am asking you nicely , in the name of all that is good release my friends and get in the flask .
is this a joke ?
now will you get in the flask ?
i knew it . he is finally retiring .
you work your ass off for ten thousand years , hurting people , helping others hurt people , then you get a decision like that .
and he is dead serious .
um , excuse me , we are having a private conversation here .
that is what i thought !
could you concentrate for five seconds ?
i am concentrating . where can we rule ?
we could create our own hell there .
you saying we go up there and kill everyone ?
eventually , cassius . but first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them . . .
. . . their damned souls will be ours .
let the sin begins that was a good one .
well , we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our new hell . how are things going down at city hall ?
i lowered the drinking age to ten .
brilliant . this is so much fun . i never want it to end .
hello , cassius .
all right . let me out .
you know , new hell really only needs one new satan .
thank you , nicky . cause now i am gonna bust adriangs head wide open .
no !
ta da . so what time is my brother expected back ?
but what about the cash ? can we keep it or what ?
it is awfully hot down here . how do you manage to stay so cool ?
and give you a good buzz .
or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity .
oh , nicky , i have missed you . come on out and say hello . . .
urr . . . uggg . . . errr . . .
keep it up and i just might make you my queen for a night or two .
oh . my . god . i cannot believe you are here . welcome . can i just tell you , i am so excited right now .
i remember that night , you had like four daiquiris .
i will call her later .
all these good people have totally been led astray .
she goes to parsongs , right ?
the home of eternal damnation , house of hades , h . e . double toothpicks . . .
okay , can i just ask you something ? what do you know about your mom ?
my brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat . which would explain my chronic halitosis .
a mountain goat ? that is really sweet .
my mom was not a goat ?
try an angel .
an angel ?
wow . what . . . what did she look like ?
how come you are not older ?
where did you meet my father ?
hello . . . yes , he is here with me now . . . i do not know if he is hot , he is my son , you perv ! i will call you back . . . oh my god , i will call you back , goodbye . that was my friend , michelle , she says hi .
how did you see me ?
valerie s crying !
i gotta help her . i gotta help dad . i gotta help everybody .
but how can i win ? adrian is stronger and smarter than me .
stronger , yes . smarter , definitely . but you have something he does not have .
what is it ?
well , nice meeting you , jenna , christa . would it be okay if i called you mommy ?
well , mommy , get me to the big apple cause i am gonna rock that town like a hurricane .
that is nicky doing down there ?
did you just talk ?
where is he ? he is late .
they castrated him . he cannot shoot arrows , he cannot piss smoke .
oh my god , he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit .
my name s beefy . i am an old friend of your father s . he is asked me to help you out .
i just need to find my brothers and be on my way , beefy .
okay , bro , this jig is up . . . just get in the bottle . just slide right on in there .
it is not me , moron .
making friends already .
it is freezing up here , beefy .
you are on earth now , kid . gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has . we will stop by k mart . get you some warm clothes .
i also have this odd pain in my mid section . kind of a hollow feeling . . .
so far , so good . now what ?
hey . . . popeye s chicken is ass kicking !
it sure is . now eat it up . you are gonna need your energy .
from now on . i am just going to avoid all moving metal objects .
you will be alright . go on . big day tomorrow . do not forget to do that sleep thing i told you about .
this is intense ! and it happens every day ? sometimes twice ? i gotta tip my hat to you people !
look , it is okay for me to shit the street . but you gotta use a toilet .
okay , just point me in the right direction next time .
come on , there s like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking .
all that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early .
your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil .
what can i do about it ?
you cannot do jack shit . . . unless you learn your evil powers .
nobody s as evil as my brothers . those dudes put the wick in wicked .
go get a soda out of the fridge .
but those are my roommate s sodas . . .
you have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid engine oil , bat s blood , moose piss . you just have to release the evil within you .
release the evil ?
we had the greatest afternoon of my life until adrian made me tell her she had a heart shaped ass .
i seem to be in trouble , beefy .
i did not murder anybody
look . you were really high . things happen .
i was with valerie , i swear . this is adriangs work . i have got to find him .
this is baloney !
that is with all the whoo whoo noises ?
everything s fine , pop .
last time you said that the renaissance happened .
please , pop , just go back to your room .
can i take him with me and have sex with his head ?
i am sorry . after careful consideration , i regretfully have to decline .
c mon , man , i am just asking for one superbowl ring .
in exchange for eternal damnation of your soul ? you are too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you , mr . marino .
you did it for namath .
yeah , but joe was coming here anyways . just go back to earth and enjoy your records and the hall of fame and the beautiful family and all that .
this is bullshit , man . i am gonna win the superbowl this year , with or without you !
knock , knock .
no , no , that is not what i said . he can keep his thumbs , but the fingers gotta go .
i got no ears ! i cannot hear !
check one two . check one two .
put it back on my head . i am falling apart here .
nothing , dad . just re arranging the furniture .
now everybody sit down .
hey , dad , i am almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape . i really think it is a masterpiece .
this was a very difficult decision , because i have three wonderful sons . i mean , adrian , so smart , so ruthless . and cassius , so strong , so tough . and nicky , so . . . so . . .
do not worry about coming up with anything . it is cool .
i mean . . . tough break .
now that was an experience . you are only coming through in waves . that line blows my mind every time .
definitely .
i do not care what kind of mood you are in at the start of that song . when it is over , that mood has been altered . wow . great shit . that is next ?
who is this , metal lick a ?
metallica , dad . come on .
you are a good devil , dad .
this is bad , nicky .
how bad ?
to do that cassius and adrian have to come back through the other way .
so go get em , dad !
nicky , the worst thing that could happen on earth is you get killed , in which case , boom , you end up back here .
no . this cannot be happening .
that is a train , son . do not stand in front of them .
well , i guess i am going to have to take a mulligan on this one .
dad , adriangs got the whole city after me . he is always a step ahead . what am i gonna do ?
uh , i will do my best , dad . do you have any advice at all for me ?
you came through , nicky .
i came through for you , mom and the butterflies , dad .
you are back in hell now , kid . there s no butterflies here . if you want butterflies , you need to be on earth .
what about you and grandpa and everyone in hell ?
listen , i got down low . your mom s got up high . you take care of the middle .
i am lucky to get away with just the head boobs , right ?
coulda been much worse .
hey .
that is a pretty brassiere .
thanks .
could you maybe not tell anyone about this ?
you got it . could you maybe not tell anyone about this ?
bus ?
you know , i was the one who created hell .
i know , your wickedness .
you know what was in hell when i came down here , cassius ?
it is stanley , sir .
nothing . no mountains . no castles . looked like a giant parking lot . it was not even called hell .
what was it called , sir .
boogerland !
that is nice , grandpa . why do not you just enjoy the fishing ?
hey . . .
your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room .
nothing s getting through that . the fire is solid as a rock .
so go get em , jimmy !
i am just a demon , nicky . i do not got devil blood in me . i would last two minutes up there with your brothers .
i have never been to earth . i have never even slept over at some other dude s house !
you were gone ten seconds . what happened ?
no wonder your uncle s so weird . . .
i was in love one time but she said i was not financially reliable enough . and she needed that .
by she , do you mean he ?
easy , liberace .
his name is andrew . i know that guy .
sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time .
there s our man .
that is with that guy ?
yo , man , i think that devil guy just got ripped off .
should we wake him up ?
did you check out the dragon mouth ?
look who s back from the dead .
that is a big pass , elton john .
you sure you are down with this ?
looking for the chief .
schnapps . . .
this do not look good .
which way did he go ?
that is ozzy trying to say there ?
come on . one more time .
no thanks . i am afraid i would not be able to give ozzy the focus he deserves .
whoa , that chick must be the real deal , then . later on .
so i was driving to work today , and some bozo in a cadillac cut me off . . .
oh , that is terrible , reege . . .
so i followed him . . .
you followed him ?
i followed him all the way downtown , and when he gets out of the car , i reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat .
you keep a bat under your seat ?
recently , yes ! so i run up behind this guy , and start bashing his brains in with this bat , and it made me feel happy ! did you ever see the untouchables ?
yes , great movie . . .
please . you got to .
i am not nicky . i am not home ! i do not live here !
good idea . . . kill me .
dude . seriously ?
you gotta kill yourself .
hello .
you smell like coconuts .
it is comptoir sud pacific . makes me feel like a hula girl . which is kinda what i am going for . wanna come in ?
no thanks . i am looking for a girl named valerie who also smells like coconuts .
valerie doran ? two floors up , one window over .
thanks , much . good luck with the genital tucking .
adrian ?
you got the wrong window again , man .
that was amazing . thanks so much . you did not have to do that .
that is okay . i get messed with all the time and when i saw him doing that to you i just lost it . i hate when people take advantage of tourists . it ruins it for the rest of us .
you think i am a tourist ?
i am sorry . i just assumed . your accent maybe . where are you from ?
the south .
really ?
yeah . deep south . she laughs along with him , not sure why .
why are you laughing ?
i do not know , but i like it . say . your glasses are nice . they make your eyes look sparkly and big . it is fun to look at them .
my dad s an optometrist .
my dad s in hell , and he is falling apart .
i am sorry . it is really tough when your parents get older .
if i do not save him , i do not know what i am gonna do .
here , have a popeye s . this drumstick ai not for beating it is for eating .
that is alright . i already ate lunch . i actually would not mind getting a gelati .
could i come with you to getting a gelati ?
if you want to .
want to ? a million angry octopus people could not hold me back !
octopus people ?
it is freezing my hands .
this town is really going to hell lately . so what part of the city do you live in ?
i have an apartment . i do not remember exactly where . my dog knows , though .
you have a dog ? what kind ?
i would love to have a dog . but i go to school full time . it would not be fair to the dog .
school ?
parsons school of design . i knew growing up i was not much to look at , so i put my energy into making things that are pretty .
that is that pleasant smell coming from , your skin ?
valerie , it feels like there s a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach . is that normal ?
sometimes , sure .
so you are saying , make all pants with a drawstring , then heavier set gals do not have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store ?
basically , yeah .
you know that is nice about you ? you just seem happy being yourself . you do not try to act cool .
thanks much . you know that is nice about you , valerie ?
your juicy , heart shaped ass .
what was that ?
hey .
what were you thinking coming here ?
valerie ?
are you dead ?
no .
what are you doing ?
i think i am floating .
why would you be floating ?
i do not know . maybe it is because of your sweet voice .
look , just because you are floating does not mean i am gonna forget about you giving me the finger .
that was not me . i was being possessed by my brother , adrian . he is the one who call you a gross pig .
what do you mean , possessed ?
remember when i told you my dad was in hell ?
yes . . .
well , that is because he is the devil . and he wants to keep his throne for another ten thousand years . which is fine with me , but not with my brothers , so they broke out of hell , causing my dad . . .
. . . the devil ? . . .
you gotta believe me . you gotta believe in the butterflies .
can we go fly over central park ?
we are going to jersey ?
i never thought i would ever see ozzy live until he was dead . please tell me you like metal .
do not do it .
nicky !
where would a sweet southern boy learn to fight like that ?
do me .
i love you .
hello , friend , my name is nicky . i understand you are seeking a roommate , as per your advertisement in the village voice . would it be possible for me to fill the slot ?
yes . what is rent ?
eight hundred , split down the middle . tuesdays and thursdays i rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits .
off limits .
right . and as far as household items we can share the soap , but we will split the cost . cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap should not have to pay as much as the other guy . are not you boiling in that outfit ?
no .
it is like eighty degrees in this hallway . you from the south ?
why is that funny ?
i do not know .
it looks like the work of a brother . . .
a black guy ?
a little strange . i cannot stop thinking about this girl , valerie .
that just hurt a lot .
hey . . .
see something you like , my man ?
you calling me a thief , my man ?
no , i am just calling you . . . a guy who has my flask .
and if that is your so called flask , how would i have it unless i was , in fact , a thief ?
okay , now you gone and done it . you done messed with my business bitch !
i am a sandman !
i cut up a sandman yesterday . they said i would never get him . . . but i cut him up good , i did .
for me ? better feel sorry for yourself , sandman !
fourteen ? fifteen ? your days are running out . how long can you last ? a year . six months ? what happens when you are sixteen and you go green ?
nothing will happen ! i make the rules as i go ! ! cubs do what i say ! always have ! always will ! i got cathedral and i will never let go !
no cubs over fifteen , billy ! ever heard of a cub with a green flower ? you will leave cathedral then , billy , when you are on green , because they will not let a green stay here . if you try to stay the young ones will gut rip you apart !
are you too startled ? am i too removed from your ken ? i am neither machine nor man . . . but a perfect fusion of the two . . . and better than either . no human sculptor could match this greatness . . . do not you agree ?
all right what are you ?
we are hungry do you have anything to eat ?
how do you think we got here ? ? ! !
where do you think we came from ?
from ? from ? from ?
hiding ? yes ! hiding , hiding .
is that the wind ? not yet . . . you must hear my birds sing .
you know about sanctuary ! i know you do ! you have to help us ! you do not have a choice ! it is not your decision ! ! tell us .
never a pair . i have never had a pair .
where do you send them ?
answer the question !
do you know how long all this will last ? not thirty years . . . or thirty thousand years . . . but thirty thousand years . . . and you will be part of it . ages will roll . . . ages . and you will be here . . . the two of you . . . eternally frozen . . . frozen . . . beautiful .
there must be somebody else up here . i cannot believe that he is
let me sculpt you and i will show you where the others have gone .
that is better . how do you want us ?
nude . imagine , a pair .
how do you want us ?
all right . now you keep your bargain .
wait for the wind ! wait and hear the birds sing over you !
how did they get in here ?
regular storage procedure . . . the same as the other food . . . the other food stopped coming and they started .
what other food ?
it is a real privilege , sandman .
thanks . i thought you would be older . i expected a red .
i am .
your own work ?
i designed it myself . what will it be . . . a face job or a full body job ?
just the face .
do you have anything special in mind ?
i do not care . . . just get it over with .
you are here . i could not believe it when they told me . what are you doing ?
you should have seen me take my last runner . . . perfect . i backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated . . . his hand . . . so now you have seen him . . . that is the difference awake or asleep ?
open your eyes once , idiot . it is not every day that a sandman son is born . i am telling you , francis that is him !
had enough ?
you need a lift . let s go to arcade and celebrate . . . your alert successor . . . logan .
has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are ?
why ?
just wondered . . . what happens ?
but you do not know , you just say what everyone says . one for one . one for one .
well , why not ! ? that is exactly how everything works . how else could the city stay in balance you have a better idea ?
no , but at least i wonder sometimes instead of doing that one for one song of yours . you sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape .
did you ever see francis ?
i do not know what makes you so curious . you have any idea who his seed mother was ?
you missed something special .
the damned yellows are getting out of hand . those three ought to be in cathedral . no business scrambling in arcade . . .
you should have been with us in nursery , daniel . i am positive i recognized him
now there s a few who could have been his seed mother .
who invited you ?
that was a great shot you made .
i just might look in on new you myself .
you ? why ? you are already beautiful .
what the hell took you so long ?
did you ever see anybody renew ?
i think you have been skulling out too much . first nursery and now stupid questions .
did you ?
of course .
anybody we know ?
look . . . why do not you get into the water . . . you need it . . . more than i do .
i am fine . . . see you . . .
that is going on , logan ? !
it has nothing to do with you .
why did you do that ? ? ! !
i did not do anything , francis ! they have made us believe that . . .
it is him ! the first sandman . he killed . . . doc .
no , holly wait ! he is running . tell them the rest !
he is the one . you too . i remember . he was in a hurry . just a face job . dark hair , i said . then he killed doc and you grabbed me and the machine blew up and i ran . . . i ran .
that is right . the other one came after . the older one . smashing , killing , burning !
. . . and he was hunting the first one , this one . was not he ? was not he ? this one was running , the other one was hunting him . . .
that is your name ?
i am mary .
where do you live , mary ?
here .
why are not you in nursery ?
i am very smart .
when do you go up ?
that is wrong , available ?
please . . . no ? you mean not here that is it ? you are a private available but particular . do not worry . there s no one here but me . and you .
no . just no .
you prefer women ?
no .
well then . . . ?
nothing . i felt sad , i put myself on the circuit . it was a mistake .
sad ? what made you sad ?
a friend of mine went on carousel tonight . now he is gone .
yes . . . probably he was renewed ?
he was killed .
killed ? why do you use that word ?
is not it right ? is not that what you do ? kill .
i never killed anybody in my life . sandmen terminate runners . who brought you ?
nobody . i felt sad . . . i put myself on the circuit .
you felt sad . that is your name ?
jessica .
you are beautiful . let s have sex .
no .
later .
no .
but you put yourself on the circuit !
i thought i had to do something .
and ?
i changed my mind .
and now ?
curious .
about what ?
let s have sex . i thought you were curious .
not about that .
i am listening .
i am afraid to tell you .
i am not armed . well ?
why is it wrong to run ?
you should not even think such things . . . and you picked a strange person to say them to
i suppose . but what if you want to live ?
but if you are one of the misfits . . . that is where i come in .
i did not say that i would run . . . i just . . .
are you a or a ?
six . i go red next year .
what quad do you live in ?
k .
you could have called me yourself .
but i was not sure you would come .
i could not get you out of my mind .
i am the most beautiful woman you have ever seen , i suppose ?
maybe . . . sure . . .
thanks . . . but i have the choice .
of course .
you can have any woman in the city . what do you really want ?
you know .
i do not believe you . there has to be more .
why show me ?
i am going to run .
why tell me ?
you know something .
about running , dying what ?
both . . . running s what i am interested in .
i know what everyone knows . try like hell for renewal . you have the same chance everyone else has .
it is different now . help me .
where did you get that ?
a runner gave it to me .
and then you killed him , right ?
i let him go . . . believe me .
i do not . .
speak to your friends for me , jessica . . . please . . .
please ? what friends ?
i do not have much time .
i never heard of a sandman running . . . ever . . .
are you here to help me ?
what are you going to do ?
that is tomorrow .
i wish i could help you .
maybe you will think of something . . .
if you did know , you would tell me .
of course
if you trusted me , you would know .
a runner . . . cathedral . a woman .
you are not going , are you ?
i would rather be with you .
they are like beasts . wild .
maybe they are angry because they are grown in meccano breeders .
instead of what ? nine months inside a woman we are all raised the same but most of us do not become cubs in cathedral .
some people say children need human mothering .
insane . nurseries are better than any mother could be .
i am only telling you what i have heard . . . have not you ever wondered what your seed mother was like . . . ?
uh uh .
i have .
when did you begin to question lastday ?
i do not remember exactly . . . except i was a green . what would you like to relive , logan ?
just follow no matter how it seems . . .
but what is this why ?
the cubs . when they are flying on muscle there s no way to catch up . without the dazzle , they would just go past us too fast
i am ashamed . i was bringing you to be killed .
where ? sanctuary ? can you take me there ?
logan , i do not know where sanctuary is . but if i take you to them , they will kill you .
all right . but why ? i did not kill the runner .
yes , but they will not know that . . . or care . they are hunting you , logan . maybe me too , now . . .
that is nothing . . . there s a sandman behind us , too and there will be more soon . take me to them .
i i cannot .
then why do not you leave me go to them explain
are you taking me to them ?
yes . i do not know what else to do with him following us . why do you keep running from your
because he is my friend and i do not want to be killed by him or anyone .
he is good , is not he ?
will he find us and kill us ? yes . . . or one of the others . you know there s only one place to go now . . .
they will not believe us .
i would rather take my chances with them . . . than with francis .
they will not listen .
you think sandmen will ? there s no other way for me ,
exactly four steps now . let me lead you . now to the right . it is narrow here , you will have to get behind me .
how will they know we are coming ?
will you take me with you ?
how do we know this is the right way ?
what do you suppose this was . . . ?
some kind of breeding pens . . . i suppose . . . they say people used to breed animals , fish , anything . . . . . . to eat , of course .
i am afraid .
i do not know that is going to happen to us logan but are you glad you did not kill him ?
it does not make any difference anymore .
you are really one of us now , are not you ?
you knew that i was not before , did not you ? why did you stay with me ?
i wanted to . . . . . . and you . . . what made you kill sandmen ?
i had to . i did kill . . . for the first time in my life i killed .
because you felt like a runner , did not you .
i guess so . . . i know i felt something i never felt before . . . and i did not like it . . . not a bit . i will tell you one thing . . . sanctuary better be worth it . that is the last place for me to live now .
that is that ?
it feels like breath . it makes everything move . your hair is moving .
i hate outside ! i hate it !
do not !
it is getting dark and cold . i am tired .
do you think everything s going to turn to ice ?
i doubt it .
do not ever let go .
it all seemed to make sense until box .
maybe we are the first ones to get through . . . maybe sanctuary is near , now . . . another protected place . it could not be outside .
you are right . . . it must be near now . we will find it .
what does it mean ?
you can have any woman in the city . what do you really want ?
you know , jessica .
. . . but i still have the choice . . . ?
of course .
i have never seen a face like that before . it must be the look of great age . whoever he was he was terribly old .
they all have names and numbers on them . i wonder what they are ?
look at his face . . . and his hair . . . is that what it is to grow old ?
that sweet madman how could he come to exist ?
he had a mother and father and he knew them .
there s a sanctuary . . . there is !
you want there to be one . . . that does not . . .
there has to be ! i know it exists ! it has to ! !
no , there does not . not really just so many want it to exist . . . so many who do not want to die . . . want it so much that a place called sanctuary becomes real . but it does not exist . it never existed . just the hope .
what are we promising him ? what can we possibly give him ?
he asked if we would bury him when his time comes .
we cannot . we are going back .
to what ?
i am going to try and tell people what we have seen and
you are lying ! you will never have the chance to tell anybody anything ! you will be killed the moment you are seen !
do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them ? !
things will not change . . . you know that ! we can live here together , logan . . . have a life as long as his . . . together !
things change !
jessica . . . listen to me . . . listen to me . . . the lifeclocks made me kill francis . they make people die or be killed every day . if i did not try and destroy that . . . i could not live here or anywhere . do you understand ?
beloved son . . . so people stayed together for that feeling of love . . . they would live and raise children together and be remembered . i think i feel that way , logan . can we be that way ?
yes . you and i , jessica .
and sanctuary ?
beloved husband . . .
what does that water do ?
it is part of the hydrogalvanic system . the ocean tides are changed into energy somehow .
is it inside the city ?
yes , cats , of course . what else could they be ? cats . of course each one has his own name too .
but there are so many of them . do you know each one separately .
and . . . and how were you grown ? inside your mother ?
yes . . .
are you sure ?
what kind of jewel is this ?
i do not know .
you are both full of secrets like macavity . did you steal this ?
no .
what belongs to the people ?
all this . all of it .
what people ?
we will have to bury him .
that is that ?
i will make the arrangements .
of course . . . that is settled then . but just you remember your promise . . .
come with us .
goodbye .
hello , sandman .
hello .
we do not get many sandmen . i think we have only had one other since i have been here .
a sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else . where is the doctor ?
i like your face . would you mind if doc took a picture ? i would like him to give your face to somebody else .
it is all right with me . is he here ?
my name s holly . . . holly . in ancient times they said my number was unlucky . do you believe in luck ?
how long have you been living here ?
for as long as i can remember .
what kind of place is this ?
how did you get here ?
i have always been here . . .
are there any other humans ?
gracious . . . no .
but there may be a few around somewhere .
what makes you think so ?
my parents thought so . mother and father . you know ?
where are they ?
they are beautiful . may i have one too please ?
no i am sorry . it is not possible .
it is not fair . i will give you one of my favorite cats . . . a jellicle cat . jellicle cats have cheerful faces , jellicle cats have bright black eyes they like to practice their airs and graces and wait for the jellicle moon to rise .
that is beyond this place do you know ?
no , no , no
did your mother or father ever mention another place ?
may we stay here for a while ? we would like to rest .
are you ready to put him in ?
not yet .
we are leaving .
to a city with thousands and thousands of people .
thousands and thousands . . . as many as my cats ?
more . . . many more .
is that really it ? it does not seem very far . will we be there soon ?
that is better than gold when it is cold .
thank you . tell me what do those words mean ? beloved husband . . . beloved son . . . beloved wife . . .
my father was the husband and my mother was the wife . beloved is a word they used to stay together .
stay ? they lived together all their years ?
i know . . . we are going to try and get in this way . i do not think you can make it .
oh . . . i did so look forward to seeing all those people .

knighted ! you do not say . do you mind if i take a look at it ?
sorry .
this is the only thing i was able to save when those heathens surrounded me .
uh huh .
you see , from this vertebrae i shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton .
wait a minute , you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone ?
it was the vertebrae of a megatherium found in asia .
yeah , i remember . you said that before .
yes , it just shows i do not know why i am talking to you . i do not know you . who are you ?
okay , brother .
do not call me brother .
good morning , lovey .
i beg your pardon .
i say , good morning , lovey .
i did not care for sister last night , and i do not like lovey this morning . my name is lovett alexander , p .
i see .
i see .
well , it is a good morning , anyway .
wait a minute . is it a good morning ? say , we are supposed to be traveling east , are not we ?
why , of course . yes .
well , it looks to me as if we are traveling west .
that is ridiculous .
is it ?
it certainly is .
look here
any child knows how to tell direction . any child . i do not care where the child is in the air , on the earth , or in the sea . if you face the rising sun , your right hand is the north , and your left hand is the south
i always get it twisted because i am left handed .
oh , really ?
yes .
well , you just reverse it . your left hand is what difference does it make what hand you are ? the north is the north !
uh huh . all i know is the sun rises in the east , and we are going away from it .
he might have lost his way .
yes . and who is he ? how would he get there ?
left us here to rot . that is what they have done . heroes of the newspapers !
where are they ? do you see them ?
yes !
mr . barnard , i do not like this place . i definitely do not like this place .
will you stop squawking !
look at me . look at what they gave me to wear .
something tells me this means food . come on !
yeah ? if this be execution , lead me to it .
that is what they do with cattle just before the slaughter . fatten them .
uh huh . you are a scream , lovey .
some layout they got here . did you get a load of the rooms ? you could not do better at the ritz .
do not mind lovey . he is got the misery .
how about you lovey ? come on . let s you and i play a game of honeymoon bridge .
i am thinking .
thinking ? what about some double solitaire ?
as a matter of fact , i am very good at double solitaire .
no kidding ?
yes .
and say , honey , you look a million per cent better . wholesome , kind of and clean . you take a tip from me , and do not you ever put that stuff on your face again . why , it is like hiding behind a mask .
ha , ha who are you to be talking about a mask ? what do you mean ? you have been wearing a mask ever since we met you .
have i ?
certainly not .
believe me , it is no fun . when you fellas picked me up at baskul , they would been on my tail for a year .
the police ?
that is too bad . i got a half million shares . my whole foundation ! and now look at me !
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly you , the swindler of thousands of people
you know , that is what makes the whole thing so funny . a guy like me starts out in life as a plumber an ordinary , everyday , slew footed plumber and by the use of a little brains , mind you , he builds up a gigantic institution , employs thousands of people , becomes a great civic leader . and then the crash comes and overnight he is the biggest crook the country ever had .
yes .
i do not know why i associate with you , mr . barnard or mr . chalmers bryant or mr . embezzler or whatever your name may be .
just call me barney .
barney ? why should i ? never ! we have nothing in common . hmmpf , barney ! what effrontery !
okay , lovey .
and this trip to the valley . i cannot imagine why i would allow you to drag me down here . why , we do not know anything about these people . we are not even armed !
they are very nice people except that they have got horns .
yeah . you know .
hey lovey , come here ! lovey , i asked for a glass of wine and look what i got . come on , sit down .
so that is where you are . i might of known it . no wonder you could not hear me .
you were asked to have a glass of wine . sit down !
and be poisoned out here in the open ?
there you are !
then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said , oh , somebody s been sleeping in my bed . and then the mama bear said , oh dear , somebody s been sleeping in my bed ! and then the big papa bear , he roared , and somebody s been sleeping in my bed ! well , you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary !
i am going to sleep in my bed . come on , lovey !
they were in a quandary , and
come on , lovey .
why ? why come ong all the time ? that is the matter ? are you going to be a fuss budget all your life ? here , drink it up ! are not you having any fun ? where was i ?
oh my , is not that pretty ! what is it ?
charming chap .
well , that is that , i guess .
what are we going to do ?
it is better than freezing to death down below , is not it ?
that is what i say . what do you say to a rubber of bridge ? i saw some cards in the other room .
hey , hurry up , you slow pokes i am starved !
yes . unbosom yourself , mr . hyde .
chalmers bryant !
yeah . i though you ran this joint .
you see ? you get the idea ? from this reservoir here i can pipe in the whole works . oh , i am going to get a great kick out of this . of course it is just to keep my hand in , but with the equipment we have here , i can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there . can rig it up in no time . do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water ?
it is unbelievable .
think of it ! in times like these .
say , what about that gold deal ?
huh ?
gold . you were going to
oh that ! that can wait . nobody s going to run off with it . say , i have got to get busy . i want to show this whole layout to chang . so long . do not you take any wooden nickels .
i say , will you have a cigarette ?
no .
say , you are an american , are not you ?
hey , that is happened to you ?
nothing . why ?
look , honey . we run the pipes through here , and we connect with the main water line here .
pipes ? where are you going to get pipes ?
if you want me to !
cave , eh ? where ?
hey look !
there you are ! barnard , you would better get your things together . we are leaving .
leaving ?
yes . i have just been talking with the porters . they are going to take us . we have got clothing , food , everything . come on !
when are you going to start ?
right this very minute ! the porters are waiting for us on the plateau . and that chinaman thought he could stop me . come along .
i think i will stick around . i will leave with the porters on their next trip .
you mean you do not want to go ?
well i am
i see . you are afraid of going to jail , eh ?
well , no . you see , i got this plumbing business
all right ! if you insist on being an idiot , i am not going to waste time coaxing you . how about you ?
and mine s conway .
how do you do ?
where is your mad pilot ?
you will need suitable clothes for the journey . it is not particularly far , but quite difficult .
and the wine excellent .
it is three thousand feet , practically straight down to the floor of the valley . the valley of the blue moon , as we call it . there are over two thousand people in the valley besides those here in shangri la .
who and what is shangri la ? you ?
goodness , no !
so there are others ?
oh , yes .
who , for instance ?
for a man who talks a great deal , it is amazing how unenlightening you can be .
there are some things , my dear conway , i deeply regret i may not discuss .
you know , that is the fourth time you have said that today . you should have a record made of it .
by the way , what religion do you follow here ?
to put it simply , i should say that our general belief was in moderation . we preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind , even including the excess of virtue itself .
that is intelligent .
we find , in the valley , it makes for better happiness among the natives . we rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience . as a result , our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy .
how about law and order ? you have no soldiers or police ?
oh , good heavens , no !
how do you deal with incorrigibles ? criminals ?
why , we have no crime here . what makes a criminal ? lack , usually . avariciousness , envy , the desire to possess something owned by another . there can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything .
you have no disputes over women ?
only very rarely . you see , it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted .
suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he did not give a hang if it was good manners or not ?
well , in that event , it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her .
that is very convenient . i think i would like that .
but mr . chang , all these things books , instruments , sculpture do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters ?
they were .
well , it must have taken
centuries .
centuries ! where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures ?
that would suit me perfectly . i am always broke . how did you pay for them ?
our valley is very rich in a metal called gold , which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world . so we merely . . .
buy and sell ?
buy and sell ? no , no , pardon me , exchange .
i see . gold for ideas . you know mr . chang , there s something so simple and naive about all of this that i suspect there has been a shrewd , guiding intelligence somewhere . whose idea was it ? how did it all start ?
that , my dear conway , is the story of a remarkable man .
who ?
a belgian priest by the name of father perrault , the first european to find this place , and a very great man indeed . he is responsible for everything you see here . he built shangri la , taught our natives , and began our collection of art . in fact , shangri la is father perrault .
when was all this ?
oh , let me see way back in , i think it was , that father perrault stumbled into the valley , half frozen to death . it was typical of the man that , one leg being frozen , and of course there being no doctors here , he amputated the leg himself .
he amputated his own leg ?
yes . oddly enough , later , when he had learned to understand their language , the natives told him he could have saved his leg . it would have healed without amputation .
well , they did not actually mean that .
yes , yes . they were very sincere about it too . you see , a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here . they have never known anything different . so what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here .
well , is it ?
rather astonishingly so , yes . and particularly so in the case of father perrault himself . do you know when he and the natives were finished building shangri la , he was years old and still very active , in spite of only having one leg ?
and still active ?
you are startled ?
oh , no . just a little bowled over , that is all .
forgive me . i should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age . climate , diet , mountain water , you might say . but we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live . in your countries , on the other hand , how often do you hear the expression , he worried himself to death ? or , this thing or that killed him ?
very often .
and very true . your lives are therefore , as a rule , shorter , not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide .
that is all very fine if it works out . a little amazing , of course .
why , mr . conway , you surprise me !
i surprise you ? now that is news .
i mean , your amazement . i could have understood it in any of your companions , but you who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds . or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it ?
mr . chang , if you do not mind , i think i will go on being amazed in moderation , of course .
one moment . you say the high lama is the only one who can give us any information ?
the only one .
and he can arrange for the porters to take us back ?
the high lama arranges everything , mr . conway .
yes . i am afraid it does .
shall we have another ?
charming , is not she ?
yes , charming .
your brother seems quite fascinated by her .
why not ? she is an attractive young woman .
young ? she arrived here in . she was at the time . she was on her way to join her betrothed when her carriers lost their way in the mountains . the whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people .
amazing ! she still does not look over . when is she likely to grow old in appearance ?
not for years . shangri la will keep her youthful indefinitely .
suppose she should leave it ?
leave shangri la ! that is not likely . you could not drive her out .
no , i mean about her appearance . if she should leave the valley what would happen ?
oh , she would quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age .
it is weird . chang , how old are you ?
you must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey . he could never get through that country alive .
what do you want ?
i have offered you some warm broth . i thought perhaps
please calm yourself . you will soon be well if you do .
i do not need any advice from you ! get me a doctor !
i am sorry , but we have no doctors here .
no doctors ? that is fine . that is just fine .
please let me help you .
sure , you can help me ! you can help me jump over that cliff ! i have been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain , but i have not got the nerve to jump !
you should not be looking at the bottom of the mountain . why do not you try looking up at the top sometimes ?
of course , the porters will be very well paid that is , within reason .
i am afraid that would not help . you see , we have no porters here .
no porters here ! !
what exactly do you mean by almost any time now ?
you know , it is very , very strange , but when you saw me in the corridor , i was actually on my way to you . i bring the most amazing news . the high lama wishes to see you , mr . conway .
amazing , mr . chang . this place is amazing ! and that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent . oh , i have looked around . i have seen everything . your woodworkers and your cloth weavers they all seem so very , very happy .
yes .
you may not know it , mr . chang , but right here you have utopia .
you have very kind mr . lovett .
i do not mean it in that sense . i only give credit where credit is due . er , mr . chang , i am very anxious to have you realize that i never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story .
oh , i am so glad .
simply preposterous . do you know what i did last night ? last night , mr . chang , i held a sort of a self inventory . i said to myself last night , mr . chang , i said , lovey mr . lovett ! mr . lovett , i said , you are an ungrateful fool . . .
why , no .
ungrateful fool . . . ! those were my very words to myself last night . here are these people in shangri la doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and i have not done one single thing to show my appreciation .
now , what would you like to do ?
well , mr . chang , i thought , with your permission of course , and while i am waiting for these porters , i would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful . geology .
splendid !
is not it ? is not it ! you know i was a professor for twenty years ? and a very good one .
i am sure you were . when would you like to start ?
oh , immediately .
then it is done .
oh , thank you . thank you !
we were just going to bury him when you came along .
in that event , we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately . some means to get us back to civilization .
are you so certain you are away from it ?
as far away as i ever want to be .
oh , yes . there is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here . that is our only contact with the outside world . every now and again , depending upon favorable weather of course , they make the journey .
how can we get in touch with them ?
the high lama is the only one from whom any information can come .
a fine trick ! smart , are not you ? what a pack of lies you told us about those porters ! of course the minute they arrive , we can make arrangements to leave . if they take us . but you knew very well you would tell them not to !
now , my dear boy . you should not
it is all your fault ! it was all arranged until he spoke to you ! why cannot you leave us alone ?
do you mean to tell me you want to leave shangri la ?
i will die if i have to stay here another minute ! i have waited a long time for this chance to go , and you are not going to stop me now . if i have to , i will go alone . it was i who bribed the porters . if it were not for me , you would never get out !
i thought the porters had instructions from the high lama not to take anyone .
the high lama ? who pays any attention to him ? the porters laugh at the high lama . all they want to know is how much gold he will give them . well , i gave them more gold . i have been stealing it for a year . i would do anything to get out of this place . to get away from that high lama the one who calls himself father perrault ! why , he is been insane for years !
father perrault is dead .
he is dead ? that is fine . you will not see me shedding any tears over him ! oh george , you must take me with you !
are not you afraid to leave ? you do not want to look like an old woman , do you ?
old woman ? chang told you that , did not he ?
yes .
you are lying , are not you ?
are you taking me ?
no , i cannot ! i cannot ! you have got to let me rest ! you have got to let me rest !
sit here , near me . i am an old man and can do no one any harm .
are you the high lama ?
i trust you have been comfortable at shangri la , since your arrival .
it is astonishing and incredible , but
what is it , my son ?
you are the man chang told me about ! you are the first who two hundred years ago you are still alive , father perrault !
that conway seemed to belong here . in fact , it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here .
that i be brought here ? who had that brilliant idea ?
sondra bizet .
oh , the girl at the piano ?
yes . she has read your books and has a profound admiration for you , as have we all .
of course i have suspected that our being here is no accident . furthermore , i have a feeling that we are never supposed to leave . but that , for the moment , does not concern me greatly . i will meet that when it comes . what particularly interests me at present is , why was i brought here ? what possible use can i be to an already thriving community ?
we need men like you here , to be sure that our community will continue to thrive . in return for which , shangri la has much to give you . you are still , by the world s standards , a youngish man . yet in the normal course of existence , you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity . here , however , in shangri la , by our standards your life has just begun , and may go on and on .
but to be candid , father , a prolonged future does not excite me . it would have to have a point . i have sometimes doubted whether life itself has any . and if that is so , then long life must be even more pointless . no , i would need a much more definite reason for going on and on .
yes , of course , your brother is a problem . it was to be expected .
i knew you would understand . that is why i came to you for help .
you must not look to me for help . your brother is no longer my problem . he is now your problem , conway .
mine ?
i have waited for you , my son , for a long time . i have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers . i have looked into their eyes and heard their voices always in hope that i might find you . my friend , it is not an arduous task that i bequeath , for our order knows only silken bonds . to be gentle and patient , to care for the riches of the mind , to preside in wisdom , while the storm rages without .
bob ! i think i hear motors !
colonel , wait a minute , they may be here now ! say george , get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here .
and be sure that none of the natives get in .
yes .
the power house they have blown it up ! the planes cannot land without lights .
all right , go ahead ! we go on to the next plane . bring out any people that are left .
bob , these are all that are left .
the next time you are in wild country like this , keep in touch with the british consul .
just what i needed too .
you ?
hurray !
how i am going to bask in reflected glory ! people are going to point to me and say , there goes george conway brother of the foreign secretary .
hello , freshie . did you make that report out yet ?
yes , bob .
did you say we saved ninety white people ?
yes .
hurray for us . did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated ? no , you would not say that . they do not count .
you would better try to get some sleep , bob .
do not worry , george . nothing s going to happen . i will fall right into line . i will be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be . i will be the best little foreign secretary we ever had , just because i have not the nerve to be anything else .
do try to sleep , bob .
oh , stop it !
george , what are you going to do ?
what are these people ?
oh george , come on .
what is it ? has he fainted ?
he is dead .
what is it ?
see that spot ?
yes .
that is where we were this morning . he had it marked . right on the border of tibet . here s where civilization ends . we must be a thousand miles beyond it just a blank on the map .
that is it mean ?
hello , george . cigarette ?
thanks . i suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure .
we have had plenty of it the last few days .
it is far from over , from what i can see . this place gives me the creeps , hidden away like this no contact with civilization . bob , you do not seem concerned at all .
oh , i am feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything . i think i am going to like it here .
you talk as though you intend on staying .
something happened to me , when we arrived here , george , that well did you ever go to a totally strange place , and feel certain that you have been there before ?
what are you talking about ?
i do not know .
do not you ever want to see that is on the other side of the hill ?
what could there be except just another hill ? in any event , i am not curious . at the moment , it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home . i would give anything to be in london right now .
of course you would . if ever we get out of this place , the thing for you to do is to take that job with helengs father .
what do you mean if we should get out ?
did i say if ?
that is what you said .
well i mean
that is on your mind , bob ? you talk as though we are going to have trouble getting out of here .
george , i have been putting things together . do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot ? and why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane ? chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point . what brought them there ? unless it was to meet us ?
chang s first question was about the pilot .
uh huh .
there must be some connection between the plane and this place . they must have deliberately brought us here . why , bob ? what reason could they have for doing a thing like that ?
well i heard that if you want a mangs wife , she is yours , if he is got any manners .
nothing about the porters yet ?
porters ?
good heavens , bob , we have been here two weeks and we have not found out a thing .
well , we have not been murdered in our beds yet , george , have we ?
i am afraid the porters are just a myth . i guess we never will know why we are here , or how long we are going to be held prisoners .
george , what do you think you are doing ?
george , come back !
let me up ! let me up !
what about the porters ?
porters ?
did not you find out anything about the porters ?
for heavengs sake , bob , that is the matter with you ? you went out there for the purpose of
george you are behaving like a child . you have not opened your mouth in two weeks .
i said we are getting out of here . back to civilization . i made a deal with the porters . they brought in a load of books or something , and they are leaving tomorrow at dawn . they are waiting for us five miles outside the valley . come on , get your things together . where is your top coat ?
you cannot leave , george .
why not ? that is going to stop me ?
you must not . you have got to stay here now .
something grand and beautiful , george . something i have been searching for all my life . the answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime . i have found it , george , and i cannot leave it . you must not either .
i do not know what you are talking about . you are carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up . if you will only tell me about it .
well , i i really do not know what to say . except that you must be completely mad .
so you think i am mad ?
what else can i think after a tale like that ? good heavens , bob , things like that do not happen today . we are living in the twentieth century .
so you think it is all nonsense , huh ?
i think you have been hypnotized by a lot of loose brained fanatics . why , i would not believe it if i heard it in an english monastery . why should i swallow it here in tibet ? how do you know the things they told you are true ? did they show you any proof ?
i do not need any proof .
i knew there was a reason i hated this place . i would give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they have done to you . how do you know the things they told you are true ? did they show you any proof ? all this talk about the lamas being hundreds of years old . how do you know ? did you see their birth certificates ? i cannot believe it , bob . a bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world . and you , bob conway two feet on the ground conway want to join them . it is horrible .
is that all my story meant to you ?
what else could it mean to me ? it is obviously a lot of bunk .
then you would better go , george . this is no place for you .
it is no place for you , bob . think of that is waiting for you . do you want to stay here until you are half dead ? until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them ?
please , george . i do not want to talk about it anymore .
you have got to talk about it . what about me ? you said they stole that plane to bring you here . i did not want to come . you owe me some responsibility .
i am tired of owing you things . you are free to go . go ahead .
it is that girl that girl has twisted and turned
look here , bob , ever since i can remember , you have looked after me . now i think you are the one that needs looking after . i am your brother , bob . if there s something wrong with you , let me help you .
oh , george . . .
besides , i i do not feel like making that trip alone , bob .
george , you could not possibly stay here , could you ?
i would go mad !
george , i may be wrong , i may be a maniac . but i believe in this , and i am not going to lose it . you know how much i want to help you , but this is bigger , stronger if you like than brotherly love . i am sorry , george . i am staying .
george , are you sure of the porters ? about their taking care of you , i mean ?
oh yes . it is all set . maria made the arrangements .
maria ?
yes , the little russian girl .
that is she got to do with it ?
you cannot take her away from here !
why not ?
because you cannot . do you know what will happen to her if she leaves shangri la ? she is a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved . take her out of this valley and she will fade away like an echo .
what do you mean fade away like an echo ?
this would be funny if it was not so pathetic . why , she is not a day over twenty !
you are wrong , george .
so everyone is serenely happy in shangri la ? nobody would ever think of leaving ? it is all just so much rot ! she is pleaded with me ever since i came here to take her away from this awful place . she is cried in my arms for hours , for fear i would leave her behind . and that is more , she is made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters for me !
i do not believe it ! i do not believe a word of it !
she was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were , bob .
you say the porters are waiting for us ?
yes .
the clothes ?
yes , everything !
what about the others ?
i have already asked them . they are afraid to make the trip . we will have to send an expedition back after them .
lucky thing for me you snapped out of it , too . you saved my life . i never could have made it alone .
what was that ?
was saying
bob , cannot you get them to wait for us ? they are leaving us farther behind every day .
target practice again ! one of these days they are going to hit us .
where did you come from ?
i am alexander p . lovett , sir .
where were you hiding ?
hiding ? oh , no . hunting i was in the interior hunting fossils . this morning i looked up suddenly
no . that is not possible ! if we had landed , we all would have been awakened .
of course . we never left the air . i know i did not sleep the whole night long .
that fellow got on at baskul .
good .
what if he refuses ?
we will smash his face in . that is what we will do .
i guess we are in for it .
in for what ?
i do not know . he must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from fenner . when he lands , we will find out .
you mean to tell me you are not going to do anything until we land ?
what do you suggest ?
why , you you look here he may dash us to pieces !
imagine having all that fuel there , waiting for us ! george , something tells me our journey is just beginning .
huh ? i give it up . but this not knowing where you are going is exciting anyway .
at the mercy of a mad pilot .
oh , please . i hope you are not going to run away this time .
my name s sondra .
you know , each time i see you , i hear that music . what is it ?
was this your idea ?
yes . hold this pigeon .
you suggested my being brought here , did not you ? what gave you the idea i would fit in ?
that was easy . i read your books .
oh , you have read my books . you do more things ! what have my books got to do with it ?
i saw a man whose life was empty .
a man whose life was empty !
as a matter of fact , all i saw was a little boy whistling in the dark .
a little boy whistling in the dark ! ? do you realize that there is a british cruiser waiting at shanghai , smoke pouring out of its funnels , tugging at its moorings , waiting to take mr . conway back to london ? do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that conway is missing ? does that look like a man whose life is empty ?
yes .
i really only brought you here to show you my pigeons !
there are so many questions i would like to ask you , i hardly know where to begin .
i will help you . to begin with , you would like to know what i am doing here . whether i was born here .
thank you .
well , i was almost born here . it took place in that wild country beyond the pass . my father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year . when chang found us , only father and i were alive . but he was too weak to climb the pass . he died on the way . i was brought up here by father perrault himself .
father perrault ! i envy you . i talked to him last night .
yes , i know .
i am thirty .
what is ?
all of it . father perrault and his magnificent history . this place , hidden away from the rest of the world , with its glorious concepts , and now you come along and confuse me entirely .
i am sorry . i thought i was to be the light . but why do i confuse you ? am i so strange ?
on the contrary , you are not strange . and that in itself is confusing . i have the same idea about shangri la . the sense that i have been here before , that i belong here .
i am so glad .
i cannot quite explain it , but everything is somehow familiar . the very air that i breathe . the lamasery , with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley , while its head explores the eternal . all the beautiful things i see , these cherry blossoms , you all somehow familiar . i have been kidnapped and brought here against my will . a crime , a great crime , yet i accept it amiably , with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend . why ? can you tell me why ?
perhaps because you have always been a part of shangri la without knowing it .
i wonder .
i am sure of it . just as i am sure there s a wish for shangri la in everyone s heart . i have never seen the outside world . but i understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy . yet i just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security , where there s beauty and comfort , where they would not have to be mean and greedy . oh , i just wish the whole world might come to this valley .
beautiful ! i am waiting for the bump .
bump ?
ouch !
you see , it is not a dream .
you know , sometimes i think that it is the other that is the dream . the outside world . have you never wanted to go there ?
goodness , no . from what you tell me about it , it certainly does not sound very attractive .
it is not so bad , really . some phases are a little sordid , of course . that is only to be expected .
why ?
oh , the usual reasons . a world full of people struggling for existence .
struggling , why ?
well , everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself , accumulate a nest egg , and so on .
why ?
you know , if you keep on asking that , we are not going to get anywhere . and do not ask me why .
i was just going to .
it is the most annoying word in the english language . did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it ? mother s little darling mus not stick her fingers in the salad bowl . why ? because it is not lady like to do that . why ? because that is what forks are made for , darling .
why , mother ?
would you like to wring my little neck ?
i would love it !
i have thought about it for years . i knew you would come . and i knew if you did you would never leave . am i forgiven for sending for you ?
it would serve you right if you were left behind .
could not you arrange to make a little less noise ?
i tell you , we are going west , and shanghai is east of here !
be quiet ! fenner s the best pilot in china . he knows what he is doing .
what do you want him to do ?
what is it ?
why , he is speaking english .
now that dinner is over , if you will excuse us , we are very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home .
that is what i mean mysterious . mr . conway , i do not like that man . he is too vague .
how about you ? do you want to go ?
go ? where ?
home . away from here . i have got porters to take us back .
oh , my dear boy , i am sorry . that is impossible . why , i have my classes all started .
i do not care what you have got started . do you want to go ?
well no i think i would better wait . yes , yes . i will . i will wait .
you will wait till you rot !
excuse me
you promised to come for tea yesterday . i waited for so long .
i am sorry . i have not even got any cigarettes left !
i will make some for you ! you will come today ?
perhaps .
please say you will . the days are so very long and lonely without you . please . . .
all right , i will be there .
thank you .
the hell happened ?
hesitated , sir .
you shot an eight year old girl .
uh . . . yes . apparently i did , air .
the hell were you thinking ?
well , i dunno . i mean , when you looked at all the other options . . . it just seemed sorta obvious .
sir , before you boot me , i just want to explain . i mean , okay , you got a goat guy with a hook for a head . . .
cowan
wait . uh sir . please . anyway . hook head guy . i am thinking how can he think with a hook for a head ? answer that is not his head . then i think
cowan
of course not , cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road , cause , if you looked at it , the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually one guy and
yes . that is true . actually , at this point , i just want a job . wait . what do you mean . . . yet ?
so . . . this door . it is . . . not an exit . . . ?
. . . touch that .
what the hell . . .
kids game a couple galaxies over .
i guess i lost
we have one motto peace on earth .
and goodwill toward man ?
no . just peace on earth .
once i thought the biggest thing i will ever do was guard the president .
it is easy . you work your way up the secret service , one day stand with the president , meet the most important people on the planet , fulfill your dreams , live happily ever after .
and if i say yes ?
. . . think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which i assure you i have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct
your supervisors have no idea why you are here .
they do not ?
that is so funny , cadet cowan ?
well . . . you know , when you say normal , what , exactly . . .
for instance . . . it says here you lost your parents at , and , since then . . .
sir . i thought those records were sealed .
you think we are nuts .
no it makes sense . cause i gotta tell ya , when i was in third grade they told me i was crazy cause i swore that our teacher was from , like , venus or something .
only the damn guy will not know it .
from now on , you will respond only to the name jay . you will dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the ins special services . you are not to stand out in any way . understand ?
everybody , listen up we have had a tremendous amount of movement lately . be aware . be safe . have a good day . oh , uh . . . cowan ?
hell of an assistant , is not he ? damn guy moves so fast , he actually gets there before you even ask for him .
sorta literally gets ahead of himself .
so . . . wait . you just asked . . . but he goes so fast , he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it .
his physics are a little different than ours . do not worry
it will make sense later ?
sorry , cowan , i found out literally just before the ceremony . apparently you are to report for further review .
further . . . what are you talking about , air ? that makes no sense i hold three cadet class records
bull . . . loney sir . i am sorry . sir , i am sorry . sir . i just , i find it hard to believe that it did not come from you . i mean , everything here comes from you .
well this did not .
look . i do not know why . i could guess , however . maybe it is your attitude . or that you are not even close to a team player . or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors .
actually , sir
cowan . do you ever think that maybe , just maybe , other people might be right and you might be wrong ?
all the time , sir .
you do ?
which do you have your money on , dee ?
i would go with number three .
mikey . hold it , mikey i want you to talk to me . mikey . i am telling you . . do not make me . . . mikey gimme the .
oh . shit . it is in the car
little more burn on the perimeter they were not roasting smores here . dig out this hole a little . cmon , i know it is late , but the sooner we get it right , the sooner we will all be home .
kay , i am sorry . . .
kay , listen , i dunno what got into
i was not scared . . .
grab the coffee , will ya ? i told zed i would give him a buzz .
listen do me a favor do not mention the thing
helluva night , is not it ?
hell , i may as well do something useful .
dee , you have been useful for years . we are clueless , you are tired . why do not you go home and get some rest .
dee . god damn it . i told you to go home .
we will take it from here .
what ? who the hell are you ?
vayanse . you others , go on .
sir
pasen al furgon v larguense de aqui ! take the van and go .
sir , you cannot just
this is a neurelyser . it was a gift from some friends from out of town . i need you to look at it . this red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain . more specifically , the ones for memory , which it will then block . i said i need you to look right here .
why ? what are you gonna do ?
underground gas vein . next time , be more careful when you shoot off your guns .
what ?
well , how about if i guess , then ? black vast space . deep . spiritual . the essence of infinity .
we wear black .
the point is to not call attention to ourselves .
it is a bug .
right .
so . . . lemme get this straight . we got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets . we got information no one else in the world is privy to . and we are in a ford ltd about to go look at an insect ?
so that is the problem ?
i tell you , if we really wanted to bland in , that would what we would be wearing . i think it would be a good look for you , too . i will even help you choose a tattoo .
it is the way we do it . the way we have always done it .
i know , but we are on a college campus . . .
i think she is the alien . in any case , she is clearly spent my too much time alone in this room .
keep her out of here while i check it out .
i am just saying it was cold . i think she kind of liked me .
she did not even know you . .
i know , that is usually the only time i actually have a shot . and what if i wanted to see her again ? i would have to completely re introduce myself .
such a shame , too . cause you made such a good impression the first time .
hey , i was working her . i was working my thing .
just so i understand . . . you are thing is . . . acting like an idiot ? or is it actually being an idiot ? besides
i know , i know . i read the manual . no attachments . we work alone . blah . blah .
if you do not have anyone to tell , you will not tell anyone . believe me , you get used to it .
i think you are too used to it . if you ask me , you have been doing this job too long .
you do not know the half of it .
what would you do before this , anyway ? wait let me guess . ice sculpture ? rock ?
i taught kindergarten .
ha ha . no , really .
well , one thing s for sure . you could certainly lighten up .
why ?
why ? well , it would not hurt you to have a little more fun . i know i do not know you all that well , but
you do not know me at all .
kay , um . . . how , uh , fast does this thing actually go . . . ?
what ?
something seem unusual to you about that ?
uh . . . you mean . . . a family of sixeyed , red faced space creatures travelling to new mexico to have dinner with their cousins , the invertebrates ? seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me .
if it was just a meal , why did they have so much luggage ?
i dunno . maybe it was baby supplies , kay starts the car , starts to pull a u turn .
that is this ?
well , mr . intuition . . . when the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence , what does that lead you to believe ?
i guess it is simple , huh ? they are either gone . . . or dead .
or someone has a nitrogenizer .
now what ?
a signazoid s eleven thousand pounds . i think we would know if held left .
then would not we also know if he is here ?
he is a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is .
there s gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown philadelphia . i take it there s a reason we are going to this one .
something s wrong here .
gee . you really think ?
jeebs is eager to have me deport him . but would rather kill himself than go downtown . why ?
i dunno . why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner ? .
why did mikey leave nazca ?
and that is this . . . ?
looks like a train ticket .
that is going on , kay ?
i do not want to rattle you , but dee was here for the war of the worlds .
the radio show ?
no . the aliens organized , all of them , and tried a coup . they made it seem like a radio show afterwards .
you think that is that is happening ?
ernie goose ? cynthia ?
jesus . . .
jesus christ . . .
where is it coming ? where is he landing ?
perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs . . .
oh , yeah ? fill us in , why do not you .
what if he is telling the truth ?
kay
he is here to help ! ?
yes . well , in his own mind , yeah . what if , from his point of view , he is ?
how does that help me ?
great . fine . listen , why do not we call the pentagon , maybe they will take you back with the new age well wishers . i will stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs .
kay . all i am saying
i know what you are saying . and i am telling you i do not trust him
i know you do not trust him . you do not trust anybody
cause i have been doing this thirty years and if i do not know when something does not feel right by now
what are you doing ?
since how long ?
maybe they did not get here . maybe they have been here .
we saw it in the office . it went from this big . . . to big . . . in a day .
it is marble .
would you call this a code ?
i am going to try and cut him off at the hotel . you guys get to the memorial . keep this stuff hidden . the last thing we need is some over zealous secret service twirp to . . .
do his job .
wow . . . this one s cool . and it looks just like a shotgun .
actually , it is a shotgun . hold onto it
in case i need it ?
do it ! shoot him !
you were saying ?
after i got the shit beat out of me !
and i almost got digested . it goes with the job .
you coulda told me what you were doing .
who s she gonna tell , anyway ? she only hangs out with dead people .
not her . me . they are beautiful , are not they ? the stars . i never just look anymore and they are beautiful .
kay , you are scaring your partner .
i have not been training a partner i have been training a replacement .
i am just wondering that is so great out there that everyone s trying to get to it ?
or that is no horrible down here that everyone s trying to avoid it ?
yeah . his dream and our worst nightmare .
sure .
i put word out you know how long it takes to get the signals across .
so , i guess you could say you are really into insects . . .
or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare . i really like that . let the other girls have the guys like you . chiseled jaw , perfect nose , quirky dimples . i find you all so boring .
so . . . how would you hear about this ?
oh , yeah , well , you know . i am a big fan . i have read all your work .
right , right i like that stuff .
with exclusionary frecto inhibitors ?
exactly . i very much enjoy that .
once just once i thought i would made the discovery of a lifetime . . .
it is hard to find . it is an old civil war cemetery . nobody ever goes there . so . . . what is it you say you do ?
i guess you could say we are entopologists of a sort .
i do not think so . i mean , him , he could be a scientist , maybe . but you . . . exterminator , i would understand . but entopolgist ? no way .
why not ?
i swear to god , that was not here two days ago . . .
what is it ?
it is the most amazing insect nest i have ever seen . and i will tell you one thing , it sure as hell ai not the andean mollatoosa .
but it is definitely a nest , is not it ?
when ?
it would have had to have been recently within a few weeks .
what do we do ?
what do we do ? lean into it .
what the hell does that mean ?
is it my eyes . . . or is that thing a little . . .
okay . if you have got a bug problem a big one . and they are swarming and there s no way to shoot them all individually . . . how do you get rid of them ?
the only thing i could think of would be . . . you would have to get rid of the queen .
what if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is ?
what are you doing ?
they respond to fear , right ?
yeah . . . ?
what a coincidence , cause i was just thinking about you , too , jack . recognize this ?
no .
the kid looked desperate . i figured . . .
you figured what ?
your licence is revoked . permanently .
and i am arranging deportation papers .
yes . yes , that is eminently fair of you .
let s go , jeebs . downtown .
pardon me . i hate to break up this lovely little group hug , but we people are not ready for what we have . how is this going to help ?
how could it not ?
why do not you ask the mosebacke ? brazil . until years ago they ate with their hands , lived in huts , and did not even know the rest of the world existed . years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork . today , they do not exist .
come on now . people are smart .
not bad . briliiant , actually . you come unarmed , and alone . cause your army s been growing underground for what ? years ? ?
goodwill . . .
nowhere .
er . well , nowhere special .
i do not believe you , mikey . and you know why i do not believe you ? cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon .
oh yeah ? well if you are suddenly such a good samaritan , why did not you file a departure report , like you are supposed to ? you know how many rules you have just broken ?
i dunno . one ?
try seven . from unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident . you wanna tell me that is going on ? huh ?
it is . . . coming .
so . . . now what ? cattle call again ?
we have got about eight or nine prospects i want you look
. . . recent landings within a hundred mile radius of sudbury , virginia ?
nothing .
nothing at all ? now ? last month ? anything in the last few years ?
i know what this is . zed , you in ?
yeah , kay ?
did our friend announce when he is making his speech ?
noon exactly .
did he say where ?
actually , yeah
would not happen to be the lincoln memorial , would it ?
how would you know that ? kay ?
listen to me . you are holding something very very dangerous . you have just iced of your pals
they are not my pals
they are not even gonna be your enemie a if you do not give that to me really soon .
what if i do not ?
in about seconds they are gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute .
will it lower the curve ?
i do not think it is a tradeoff you really want to make . now give it to me i can reverse the effects if you give it to me now .
found it .
tell us the truth . you do not just find these things , at least not in this neighborhood .
i just wanted to scare em . so i go in to buy a starter s pistol you know , the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks and this guy , he said if i really wanted to mess with with them , he had just the thing . . .
we are from scientific american . we read about your discovery . we would like to take a look .
this it ?
i mean , i dunno . i have seen insects with really great camoflauge ability . but never like this .
we are with the immigration and naturalization service , intergalactic bureau . we monitor all alien activity in and around earth and its enveloping atmosphere .
hmnn . . . wall , it is funny , cause usually i am not all that attracted to stupid guys , but
we need to talk to you about the alien .
which way ?
really nice wheels , by the way .
how is dee ?
jupiter , actually . well , one of the moons .
kay ? that is your ?
highway , just west of smith . why ?
i need you in philadelphia . i got a code , in a high school .
he is gone , too .
what about the other agents ? ella ? tee ?
even that little bug you found in sudbury seems to have taken off .
jesus , everyone s moving . could be an assembly . does it look aggressive ?
hard to tell . i hope not .
they are gone .
i am getting a trajectory . . .
and they are buying it ?
they went right to the president .
as far as i can tell , the guy s what he says he is alone , and unarmed . all he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public .
where is he making his big speech ?
well , it was not in the jar . . .
did it leave ?
actually , i do not know . . .
yeah ? that is up ?
and get this you know how humans evolved from primates ? well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from ?
how would you know ?
now , what are we looking at ? keys . look at them all . why do we have them ? mr . president ?
well , uh . . . so we can got into things , i guess .
why , you might ask ? because you are ready . because you have finally gone as far as you can go without it .
if i may , sir . . . what exactly are you offering ?
a good question . and a simple answer . no more hunger . no more smog . no more overpopulation . no more war .
and i assume you are bringing this to us because we are the most powerful country on the planet . . .
wally !
i am sorry , but i need your help . you contain information . i need to know how to get it . can you just tell me who leo crow is ? can you tell me if
is it now ?
what ?
what ?
they are inside .
take it .
agatha
can you see the balloon man ?
drop some money .
forget that guy
no . follow him .
he will turn around .
agatha . . .
he is here .
i cannot . i have to know .
please
oh , god . . .
every day for the last six years i have thought about only two things . the first was what my son would look like if he were alive today . if i would even recognize him if i saw him on the street . the second was what i would do to the man who took him .
anderton
please , i want to go back . . .
i cannot leave . you said so yourself , there is no minority report . i do not have an alternative future .
where are we going ?
someplace safe .
i have to go back .
why ?
the other two will die without me .
i always wondered what the world would be like . but now that i have seen it , i do not need to see any more . it is all right . once i am in the tank , i will not remember any of this .
agatha , you are never going back there .
cannot you see ? she just wanted her little girl back .
who wanted her little girl back ?
the drowning woman . anne . . . but it was too late . her little girl was already gone .
she died ?
she grew up .
she is not alive , but she did not die .
i am sorry , john , but you have to run again .
what
but he did not .
then who was he ?
just some guy . . . they found .
found ? where ?
think , john . why would they set you up ?
because i found out about her . . .
about who ?
i am so sorry . . . i just want him back . . . i want him back so bad . . .
john ? what is it ?
do not worry . i could cut open your chest , sew a dead cat in there and you would never get an infection . not with the spectrum of antibios i will be shooting into you .
that is comforting .
you do understand i cannot just give you new irises . the scanners will read the scar tissue . alarms will go off . large men with guns will appear . . .
anesthesia . try to relax , john . i am saying i will have to remove your eyes . completely .
yeah
and replace them with new ones .
i know that , but i wanna keep the old ones .
why ?
because my mother gave them to me . what do you care ? they are no good to you on the secondary market anyway .
that is not much .
it is all i could safely move .
you do not remember me , do you ?
we know each other ?
from where ? d . c . ?
i put you away
yes , you did .
you made those tapes . . .
they were performance pieces .
you set your patients on fire !
so uh , if you were a plastic surgeon before . . .
there s food in the refrigerator . make sure you drink a lot of water .
how do i find the
it goes from the bathroom to the kitchen .
i cannot even stand up
i know you are in a hurry , so i juiced up the nano reconstruction around your new eyes .
the nano . . . what ?
i am setting up a timer . when it goes off tomorrow , take off your bandages and get the hell out of here . but not before then , or you will
you the sentry ?
i do not ever see any of you precops down here , i am not in trouble am i ?
no , you are not in trouble . i am interested in a murder .
kill type ?
victim s a white female .
that is an old one . one of our first .
this is the official composite of the three precogs ?
that is right . it is a combined data stream based on all three previsions .
show me just agatha s data stream .
you the only sentry ?
hence the expression . . .
. . . graveyard shift .
why s he still a john doe ? why was not he ever id s from an eyescan ?
huh , we do not seem to have her data .
try again .
hey , you wanna know where the word came from , glitch ?
looks like she was a neuroin addict like john doe here , but i show an address history that includes the beaton clinic .
you are part of my flock now , john . welcome .
lara
tell me not to worry , john .
do not worry , lamar .
which makes this the worst possible time to show that we are only human .
uh huh . . .
has the observer from justice shown up yet ?
and this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it .
lamar , i am sorry . i do not know what
you understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we have been doing down here has been some noble minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime .
i need you to do two things for me . one , watch danny witwer .
yes , sir .
you can let him look around , answer his questions , but watch him . if there s any problems , make sure we know about it first .
i understand . that is the other thing ?
and you say the third prevision was , what , a little fuzzy or something ?
danny witwer is scheduled for a tour of containment tomorrow
so give him a tour . he does not know enough to ask the right questions .
if he is looking for a flaw in the system
lara called me .
what ?
she is worried about you . and , quite frankly , so am i .
i am fine .
i hear you have been spending a lot of time in the sprawl .
i go running down there .
what if danny witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run ?
you understand , john , that the minute precrime goes national , they are going to take it away from us .
we will not let them .
just so you know , i have overridden the vehicle locator . i just wanted to talk to you before justice
justice already knows . talk to me , john . tell me that is happening ?
this is all witwer . he is setting me up .
stop . just wait . who s the victim ?
somebody named leo crow .
and who the hell is that ?
i have no idea . i have never heard of him . but i am supposed to kill him in less than thirty six hours .
all right , john , just take a breath , let s think about this . . .
i am out of breath ! i am a fucking fugitive !
then come to my house . we will talk
i cannot . they are following me right now . they will meet me there . they will halo me .
how could witwer have accessed the case file ?
can you fake the cerebral output ?
we are years from that . john , i am asking you please , come in , we will shut down the system until we get this thing figured out .
you know i cannot do that . you cannot do that . . . lamar , i need you to talk to wally , see if witwer s gone inside the temple again . then ask jad for any off hour eyedents into the analytical room
john . please . listen to me
i am not getting halo would .
you cannot run
john
people want to believe in the system . that is the beauty of it . . .
no doubt the precogs have already seen this .
no doubt .
seventeen minutes .
chief , the investigator from the fed is here .
you are kidding , that is today ?
i wrote it down in your calendar , then left a message at your house
all i need , some twink from the fed poking around right now . check again with the paper , they had it forwarded . see if the neighbors know where they went , check all relations
uh , sir . . .
what he is doing now , we call scrubbing the image , looking for clues as to where the murder s going to happen .
the brick has been repointed , the glass is original with new glazing bars . i show composite mouldings with dentils . someone took care in the renovation . let s find the architect . . .
victims are pronounced here . killers here . we never touch anything .
do not run , chief . you know we will catch you . you trained us .
everybody runs .
you do not have to do this , chief .
okay , jad , that is coming ?
we need confirmation on the time frame . location still uncertain . remote witnesses are hooked in . . .
we cannot grab it . . .
got him in the foxhall . gainsborough .
send a dcpd blue white out there , set up a perimeter and tell em we are en route . that is our confirmed time ?
somewhere near the capital ?
no maglev system .
the mall ?
look at the kid . in this one , he is on the left of the man in the suit .
yeah ? so ?
go ahead .
did he close the front door ?
what ?
you guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he is talking about .
come on , chief , you think about it , the way we work changing destiny and all we are more like clergy than cops .
uh huh . jad ?
sir ?
jad . how come you are not out there with father witwer ?
red ball ?
nope . somebody s thinking about this one .
the victim s name is leo crow .
start a location run and a contact search for future victim leo crow . and , jad , i will need a last known sheet when you get it .
i have got no address last known or otherwise no tax returns for the last five years .
i show time of occurrence , friday at fifteen zero six hours .
confirm with trig and image .
any id on the shooter yet ?
uh , yeah , you mind getting me a piece of that cake they are eating down there ? i am starving .
sure , chief . i think i will grab one for myself while i am at it . . .
i am sorry danny , but i will have to give you the full tour later on .
as i recall , they outlawed compression firearms in the district ten years ago .
they did . make yourself comfortable . we will be back in an hour .
but it is not the future if you stop it . is not that a fundamental paradox ?
why did you catch that ?
because it was going to fall .
you are certain ?
yes .
the fact that you prevented it from happening does not change the fact that it was going to happen .
you ever get any false positives ? someone intends to kill his boss or his wife , but they never go through with it . how do the precogs tell the difference ?
the precogs do not see what you intend to do , only what you will do .
it was iris hineman . she developed the precogs , designed the system and pioneered the interface .
speaking of interfacing , i would love to say hello .
to them .
cops are not allowed inside the temple .
really ? you have never been inside ?
we keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering .
so i will be the first one to go in then ?
maybe you did not hear me .
if it is a question of authority .
there s no question . you do not have any .
i find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs .
the precogs are pattern recognition filters , nothing more .
but you call this room the temple .
just a nickname .
sorry . old habit . i spent three years at fuller seminary before i became a cop . my father was a minister . lutheran .
what does he think of your chosen line of work ?
at least now you and i have the chance to make sure that kind of thing does not happen to anyone ever again .
why do not you cut the cute act , danny , and tell me exactly what it is you are looking for ?
flaws .
there has not been a murder in six years . there s nothing wrong with the system . it is perfect .
you set me up . . .
it seems i have found a flaw , john you .
you gonna tell on me ?
i cannot touch you ! and john , you cannot be in here ! you will confuse them !
they are not in any pain . we keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins . plus , we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels do not want em to drift off to sleep , but they cannot be kept too awake either .
her pituitary dumped a week s worth into her system . . . what did you do to her ?
nothing . . . she grabbed me , and then there was an image on the screen . . .
she was looking right at me .
she spoke to me .
to you ? i do not think so . . . what would she say ?
wally , listen to me . . .
i like you , wally , so i am not gonna kick you , or hit you with anything , but only if you promise to help me . . .
are these all of her previsions ?
just go to the beginning !
detective . nice of you to come down here . seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now . jesus , that is up with your eye ?
i need your help .
well , hey , you did not have to come all the way down here . for you , chief , i make housecalls . . .
i need help with her .
i am impressed , anderton . you are on the lam , but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself .
rufus . she is a precog .
she is a precog ?
are you reading my mind right now ?
rufus , for christ s sake , get up .
she is got information inside of her . i need you to get it out .
no . no way . i would not even know where to begin ! those thoughts about my cousin elena they were just thoughts . i would never
c mon , rufus , you have been busted twice for felony hacking .
so ?
i tell you what . i do this , i get to keep whatever images i get from her head .
they do not belong to anybody .
stop
what happened ? where is the rest ?
rufus , play it back . . .
i scored a goal !
i won !
four . wow . what a big boy . i love you , sean .
okay . . . now let me time you .
are you kidding ? there s absolutely positively no way , on my best day , i could ever beat twelve seconds !
come on !
sean you are not real .
you gotta have faith , dad .
it is a little late for that .
wanna hear something funny ?
what the hell .
you are alive ?
no . he got tired of pretending .
oh , sean
the funny thing is , i started to believe he really was my dad .
sean
i feel bad about that . i need you to forgive me .
i forgive you .
once i even told him i loved him .
i forgive you . . .
the more you want to believe something , the easier it is to be fooled .
i was looking for you . . .
i know that . i know you would have done anything to find me . i know you would have died for me .
i wanted to .
who are you ?
i am your son . i am you .
sean , wait . . .
six years ago . baltimore . you grabbed a kid at francis public pool in the west end .
do you know who i am ?
some somebody s father ?
. . . and that i needed his help . it was not so bad really . i sang him a song , made him laugh , bought him a pretzel . i took care of him . i made him happy .
where have you got him ? is he all right ? tell me , you fuck where is he ? !
it floated back up . i had to take him out and
you are not gonna kill me ?
but you have to . they said you would .
the precogs were wrong .
you are supposed to kill me . he said you would .
look , i have put my family through enough misery . you gotta kill me ! this way i can leave em something .
crow . i am not gonna kill you .
look , believe me , i know it is hard , but you gotta do it
i am asking you again , who made you do this ?
i do not know i never saw his face . all i know is , the next day i was out , so the guy must have had juice somewhere . look , man , you gotta go through with this .
what about the picture
fake . he gave it to me . now shoot me , goddammit , before i lose my nerve !
tell me , who was it , set this up ?
if i tell you , my family gets nothing .
who made you do this ?
kill me !
let go of the gun .
you are not gonna kill me . . .
something wrong ?
yes , i am afraid that would be from the doll s eye .
the what ?
you have three minutes to tell me what you are doing here before i feed you to a few of my more predacious plants .
just what is it you think i can do for you ?
you can tell me how someone . . . could fake a prevision .
that is so funny ?
if the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention , then yes , i invented precrime .
you do not seem all that proud .
i am not . i was trying to heal them , not turn them into . . . something else .
heal who ?
the innocents we now use to stop the guilty .
you are talking about the precogs . . .
it began as play . a guessing game like you play with any toddler , except these children always guessed right . and then the nightmares started . they were all different , but all the same . they were all about murder . and the murders were all happening .
and how did lamar become involved ?
back then , he was still a da , and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom . you have to understand , these people were the dregs of society . but once they saw their children . . . he decided he would do whatever he could for them . he is that way , you know , paternal about certain things . precrime . the precogs . you .
you say some of the children died ?
so many of them . . . despite what we did for them . or maybe because of what we did to them . it does not matter . it is a perfect system now , is not it ?
i am not a murderer . i have never even met the man i am supposed to kill .
and , yet , a chain of events has started . a chain that will lead inexorably to his death .
not if i stay away from him .
how can you avoid a man you have never met ?
so you will not help me ?
what ?
most of the time , all three precognitives will see an event in the same way . but once in a while , one of them will see things differently than the other two .
jesus christ why did not i know about this ?
because these minority reports are destroyed the instant they occur .
why ?
you are saying that i have halo would innocent people ?
i am saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might , just might , have an alternate future .
does burgess know about this ? about the minority report ?
i used to joke with lamar that we were the mother and father of precrime . well , in my experience , parents often see their children as they want them to be , not as they are .
answer my question . did lamar burgess know about the minority report ?
yes , of course , he knew , but at the time , he felt we both felt their existence was . . . an insignificant variable .
insignificant to you maybe , but what about those people i put away with alternate futures ? my god , if the country knew there was a chance they might not
the system would collapse .
i believe in that system . . .
you want to bring it down .
but you will bring it down if you kill leo crow . why , that will be the most spectacular public display of how precrime . . . did not work .
i am not gonna kill anybody .
hold that thought .
why should i trust you ?
you should not . you should not trust anyone . . . certainly not the attorney general who wants it all for himself . not the young federal agent who wants your job . not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he is created . do not trust anyone . just find the minority report .
you said they are destroyed .
i said the record is destroyed . the original report exists for all time . i designed the system so that whenever a report occurred , it would be stored in a safe place but not declared .
what safe place is that ?
where ?
inside the precog who predicted it . all you have to do is download it .
that is all , huh ? just walk right into precrime , go into the temple , somehow tap into the precogs , and then download this minority report . . .
if . . . you have one .
and then walk out .
actually , i think you will have to run out , but yes , that is what you have to do .
i will get eyescanned a dozen times before i get within ten miles of precrime . they will pick me up . . .
how do i even know which one has it ?
it is always in the more gifted of the three .
which one is that ?
john ?
he is dead , lara .
oh , god , what did you do ?
nothing . i did not kill him .
then how did he
this is all my fault .
i have not worn this damn thing in years . i just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight .
it is insanity around here .
i thought you were retiring ?
who ?
anne lively . john was talking about her right before they took him .
john said something about him being set up because he found out about her .
we know why john was tagged .
lamar , do you know the reason why john came here to work with you ?
sean
i understand .
but i also know why he married you you are as stubborn as he is .
lamar
all right . tell you what i will do . first thing monday , i will look over the witwer evidence and i will have gideon run the containment files , see if anyone drowned a woman named what did you say her name was ?
the guy from usa today is here .
tell him not now .
he just wanted a few minutes before
sir , the press conference is starting .
congratulations , sir .
how did you get this ?
you have an emergency call on your private line .
he came to see you yesterday . right before he got tagged . what did you talk about ?
the mets . john does not think they have got a deep enough pitching roster this year , and i am inclined to agree .
why are you protecting him ? you knew he was doping , yet you did nothing about it .
the man lost a child , for christ s sake . . .
six years ago . what did you two talk about yesterday afternoon ?
none of your damn business .
oh , it is all my damn business now , lamar . investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction . . . so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy . he is my suspect .
shall we call the attorney general ? i am sure he would be happy to clarify the issue for you .
lamar , i found something .
what ?
i do not wanna say over the phone , but i think we may be chasing the wrong man .
good god . what was that ?
he told me about this . you got this from containment ?
it is the same prevision .
now the second image . watch the water . the wind s changed . the ripples are going the other way .
i do not understand
according to the sentry , anderton was watching this at containment right before he was tagged .
i know . he came to me , told me about the missing data stream . he was concerned that you might find it .
i did find it . it was inside of agatha all this time . so the question is , why would someone want this erased from the data file ?
danny , tell me what you are thinking .
i am thinking someone got away with murder .
by fooling the system . all someone would have to do is wait for precrime to stop the murder from taking place , then , a few minutes later , commit the crime in exactly the same way .
yes . . . it is called an echo . the act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the precogs .
precog deja vu . . .
so there is a way to fool the system ?
of course , it would have to be someone with access to the prevision in the first place , someone fairly high up
shhh . you know what i hear ?
what ?
near death s real popular right now , which includes everything from getting hit by a car , to falling off a high building to plane crashes . it is a big rush , you come out the other side without a heart attack .
i wanna kill my boss .
uh huh . okay . you got some images i can work with ?
right here .
uh , yeah , being concert master of the philadelphia symphony orchestra is one of our most popular choices . . .
no , i wanna kill my boss !
this is evanna , the team pilot .
so if you wanna kill someone , you take him to miami .
cannot they shut that off ?
crime of passion . no premeditation . they show up late . most of our scrambles are flash events like this one . we rarely see anything with premeditation anymore .
the information we need is embedded in the grain of wood . and since each piece is unique , the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate .
because of the nature of murder . there s nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another .
do not worry . i will bring him in unharmed .
actually , gordon , you are not gonna do that . i am taking control of the team .
sir , the team s gonna be light without those men .
here s where we are at . three men in a room . the victims here . anderton here , and this unidentified male out the window . the exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing , but i cannot make out the location . government architecture is modern conformist which means
there s thousands of units like this one .
andertongs smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media cannot id him to pick his pocket . there s fewer consumers down there , which means fewer scanners to target him .
no offense , sir , but why would not he just run ?
there are two others in the room besides anderton and crow .
it does not matter . he wins .
we can stop him .
he is trying to prove his innocence .
he cannot download her without a lot of technical help .
there a maid in this hotel ?
i do not know , why ?
if you were a child killer , you took these pictures , would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find ?
they could have been put away . anderton could have found them .
what kind of cop were you before this ?
i was a treasury agent for eight years . why ?
i worked homicide before i went federal . this is what we would have called an orgy of evidence . do you know how many orgies i had as a homicide copy , gordon ?
how many ?
that is why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie , is not it ?
i think you are swell company , knott .
people , if you do not let the spyder scan you , we will have to come in and arrest you .
why do not i feel like celebrating ?
john anderton was my friend !
he looks familiar .
who ?
the man across the street . i have seen him before . . .
what about your meeting ?
we could have lunch together .
i would love to , but i have got an open house today at the ressler place .
raincheck ?
howard
my name is danny witwer . i am
this your work ?
i like it .
thanks . you take anything in your coffee ?
cream and sugar .
i do not have any cream . sorry .
just sugar then . you and john ever come here ?
we used to , every summer .
i do not have any sugar either .
thank you . he has not tried to contact you ?
no .
you ever heard him mention the name leo crow ?
no , but then i do not talk to john that much anymore .
so you have not seen his apartment ?
that was our apartment .
since right after we lost our son .
you mean after he lost your son .
it was nobody s fault .
but john was with him at the pool ?
you said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself .
it was not a suicide attempt . i regret ever saying that .
what was it then ?
the fbi found something that belonged to my son . a sandal . . . anyway , john was upset . he . . . he . . .
he took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies . this is all in your statement , lara . . .
he shot a hole in the damn ceiling . so what ? you lose your son , let s see how well you handle it .
lamar burgess thinks that you left john because he lost himself in precrime instead of you .
you know i need to use you .
to what ? trap him ?
to prevent a murder . sooner or later , he is going to contact you .
i have not seen him in two years .
nice to meet you , wally .
shhh ! they are sleeping .
they have never been separated before .
what does he want with a precog ?
what do you think ? so he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it .
wally , the other two can still function , right ?
you do not understand . . . they are a hive mind . it takes all three for their predictive abilities to work .
are you telling me they cannot see murders anymore ?
maybe if he would taken one of the males . but the female , she is the key . she is the one they listen to , the one with the most talent . the one who takes care of the other two .
look , bobby , i do not know what happened , and i do not want to know what happened , but something s up .
what are you talking about ?
maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow . he wants you to come by the office today .
they were grabbing her fucking ass
hey . i do not know , i do not want to know . far as i am concerned , you are a good kid . i got news , though , without you here i cannot keep on your friend . i got enough people pretending to sweep .

it is as good a suite as we have , unless you want two bedrooms .
no . that is cool . bring me back eighty .

ho s a good guy
ho s a fucking pimp ! he encourages wendy to turn tricks . and she is his fucking wife !

ruiz do not like using names on cell phones . he refers to him as the red dragon .
so , whengs the drop .
how bad is it ?
it is bad . before you even showed up , he said you were maxie s token goons , and not to be trusted . he wanted to tcb alone . i was gonna ride shotgun to keep the english dude above board . now he is spooked . this shit is snowballing .
whengs it going down ?
was gonna be tomorrow morning . now , who knows ?
why is not ruiz coming ?
this welsh dude is tripping on ruiz cause he is a shot caller .
that is that ?
a shot caller . a boss , a capo . he is running shit .
so what do we do ?
we go and hang out with the dude , make him happy , drink some tea , whatever it takes , until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own . we make the drop , go home to california .
where is this happening ?
now , here s what worries me . he said he wants to meet up at a bar in red hook . you know where that is ?
no .
brooklyn .
yeah ?
he must have that shit troughed .
what do you mean troughed ?
troughed off . protected . like , you know , like he got a moat around it .
ruiz tied in out there ?
heard of them .
they ran shit back in the eighties . used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar . that is back when the irish was making a play against the italians . i do not know if they still around , but i do not fuck with those motherfuckers just in case .
it sounds to me like everybody s just a little jumpy . and since all it is is a drop , the welshmangs got nothing at stake . i say we go to his troughed off bar . it will calm his nerves , we drop the bag , and we all get back to our lives .
where we going ?
quick drop . in and out .
where is ricky ?
ricky s taken care of .
how so ?

you like the ponies ?
sure . yeah .
you bet the ponies ?
me ? no . not really .
smart . hard as hell to handicap . you know what i like ? hai alai . fast game . you know why i like it ?
why ?
it is fixed . that is the only way to win . a sure thing . see that horse . the blaze .
this one ?
yeah . the blaze . i bought her in . hired a trainer , stall , whatever it was . that horse made me over a hundred grand . in sixties dollars . you know what that is today ?
pshhh . . .
a million . easy .
she was fast , huh ?
never won a race . but it got me in with the trainer . we would have a thing , i do not remember , some fucking thing . the jockey would raise his whip , it meant the fix was in , we would all go running . people get greedy . first they bet small , they keep their mouth shut . within a month s time , everyone and their brother was in on it . the odds would drop , i mean you could watch the goddamn board . it looked like a fuckin stopwatch , the odds would drop so fast .
i like you , kid . why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you ?
mr . reuben , i swear to god , they were out of line .
last time , maybe , with the puerto ricans , but these were nice jewish boys .
they were out of line
they are fucking yeshiva buchas . you did not have to tear up the goddamn place . you knocked out a guys teeth .
that prick tried to get jessica to blow him in the bathroom
bobby , i love jessica like she is my own daughter . i would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter , but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in beverly hills and wants i should buy him an implant . your silverback horseshit is gonna cost me eight grand .
i will work it off .
not driving jess , you will not .
what ?
you are not driving jess no more . two strikes , bobby , and this last one was big . the bachelor s father goes to my schul .
so , that is it . i am out ?
i did not say that .
then what are you saying ?
bobby . you are a bull terrier and i got you herding sheep .
i do not understand .
it is my fault . i send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life , then i wonder why you seered . it is my fault . the tooth is on me . but no more . i am areassigning you .
i do not want to drive another girl , max . the only reason i am

i know .
now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what i got to say ?
yeah . sorry .
i got a way we make everybody happy .
yeah .
we try something out . there s someone i am in business with named ruiz . i want you to accompany him on a drop . just as scenery . ruiz has his boys . i just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench . as a deterrent .
ruiz knows about this ?
ruiz wants to go alone , but it is not up to ruiz . it is up to me , and i like a sure thing . just go and we are square on the tooth .
what about ricky ? he would jump at the opportunity .
ricky ? ricky i lost the truck ricky ?

he will work it off .
i do not know the kid , and what little i do scares me .
he is good people , mr . reuben . i swear .

how about this . if you are in , he is in .
i gotta tell you , mr . reuben , i am not comfortable getting in any deeper . it is one thing to look after jess . . .
you are ready to move up . christ , the way you busted up the place , you are doing worse already . may as well get paid instead of punished .
it is not that i do not appreciate the offer . . .
do me a favor . think about it . is that too much too ask ?
yes , for expenses and such . now , you will be contacted on your pager as to where you should go . you each have been given an extra battery , so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned . am i making myself abundantly clear ?

what exactly did they say ?
they said a hundred thirty fifth and twelfth .
they did not say an address ?
i told you what they said .

nothing .
how would they know who you were ?
they asked who it was .
so they said more than the address .

do not even start .
no . tell me . that is so fucking horrible about this gig ? you have been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on maxie s list , and here we are .
look , man , i never met ruiz , okay ? i do not know what the fuck i am picking up , what the fuck i am dropping off , who the fuck i am meeting . all i know is maxie s still pissed at me cause i sold his fucking van .
you sold it ? i thought they stole it .
sold it , stole it , whatever . . .
motherfucker . . .
oh , give me a break . do not tell me you feel bad for the guy .
you gotta be kidding me . i vouched for you .

you just do not fucking get it , do you ?
you know he fucks all his girls , do not you ?
what the fuck is that supposed
i mean , that is what i heard
you know this guy ?
this shit is sketchy . why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we are supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else ?
i do not know .
well , i thought you understood and i was just missing it .
missing what ? he did not say shit .
yeah , but you know horrace . what did you get off him ?
what did i get ?
yeah . what vibe ?
i detected no vibe other than that ruiz thinks you are a fucking idiot .
yo , fuck him , man . calling us guineas . . .
so is this the drop ?
like i said , i do not know .
he woulda told us right ?
yeah .

yeah , me too . you are a fucking bull in a china shop .
where do you think you are going ?

what the fuck s going on ?
dude , get back out there . you gotta help me get them in the hot tub . hang on girls ! just get out there . i will be right out . you know how i do .

that is up ?
he wants to see us now .
where ?
he said it is being arranged . he said jimmy will know .

we are not getting whacked .
why else you think he will not tell us where the sit down is ?
what are you doing .
i got a bad feeling , man . i do not want to go in naked .
you gonna shank him in the shower ?
is it so unrealistic to think ruiz , who does not even want us here , is throwing us to the wolves ? as an apology ? and i do not even know what we are dropping off or picking up
put that shit out . . .
c mon , man . . .
i swear to god , i will fucking puke .

did you hear what he just said ?
whatever . we are here . we may as well go to the penguin house .
we need guns .
we do not need guns .
i am pretty sure we do .
i listened extremely carefully . nothing was even vaguely implied . he even laughed in your face when you asked him
all the more reason .
you would not even know where to get one .
wanna bet ?
you could not even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse , how you gonna get a gun ?
that is cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden .
it was six in the fucking morning .
float me a hundred bucks .
why ?
you wanna see how fast i get a gun ?
you are out of money ?
no .
what do you have left ?

you coulda picked up a tab every once in a while .
i did ! i paid for half the fuckin drinks !
you did ?
yes i did . you asshole ! what about the room ?
what about it ?
calm down .
i fucking vouched for you . i vouched for you and you fucked me .
this shit is peanuts compared to what we are gonna make with maxie .
ricky . i am trying to save this money . understand ? i am trying to make it so my girlfriend does not have to grind her ass into other mengs erections so her daughter can go to private school .
i am sorry . . .
this is horseshit . it coulda been so easy .
it is gonna be fine .
no more , man .
let s get some sleep . that is what we need , man . sleep .
how we gonna sleep ? we only got a few hours til dinner .

let s just go now and wait .
three and a half hours ?
i do not want to take any more chances .
let s just go get guns , i would feel better .
do not fuck around . you are gonna get us all killed .
think about it you knocked out that jewish kid s tooth , cost him eight grand , maybe more . maybe lost his whole line of clientele ? he knows you are fucking up jess dancing , and i got a feeling he knows i stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me . he cannot kill us in la cause that leads to too many questions . so he flies us out here first class for a wouldrop that is turned into whatever ? he can make us disappear out here real nice . . .
where do you get this shit ?

brilliantly . care for a pint ?
no , thanks , man . we got to head out .
come , now . you just got here .
sorry about that . where is your mate ?
i cannot yet vouch for the amount , unless you want me to sit here and count .
i . . . i just hired these guys to watch my back . . .
yeah .
good morning .
you think this shit is funny , ho ?
nah , man . . .
last thing i want is you with a gun .
ricky .
is it nice ?
the soho grand ?
yeah .
you are from la , right ?
yeah .
so whenever we want . . .
yeah . grab one of the cards behind you . call that number . it is my cell .
so you are our own private guy ?
i handle most of cardiff giant s stuff .
you know my pager number ?
no . what is it ?
i do not know . i thought you might . any idea what the job is ?
a lot of persians ?
i call em wiggers .
sure . you boys want anything ?
yeah , bring us four fernet .
nigger , please . do not even order that artichoke shit . west side guineas . forget the drinks , leo . we gotta roll . what do i owe you ?
we are square .
thanks , man . you need anything , you call .
thanks .
can i borrow a piece of
dollars in c notes , a numeric pager , a double a battery , and a first class round trip ticket to jfk .
we are going to new york ?
yes . you are going to new york .
and the money . where do we bring the money ?
that money is your per diem .
yeah .
you will not carry any other pagers with you . you will not carry anything , for that matter , that i have not just given you .
keys .
what ?
what about my keys ?
you can carry your keys . you will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ . you will not speak to anyone while you are working . when you are not working , you are considered to be on call and available twenty four hours a day . this means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner . there is already a number in your pager s memory . it is a car service . when they ask you what account , you will respond cardiff giant . they will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go . in other words , there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes . do you see a pattern forming ?
i get it .
tell me .
do not worry . i get it .
so tell me how it is .
you want . . . why are you picking on me ?
so , wait , what are we dropping off ?
i never intended to test you two to that extent , but you both came through . i should have been informed there was a flag on the play , but i will take that up with ruiz . i made a few calls back east . those punks were not tied in with anyone . as for the welshman , he was not in on it . he was just plain dumb . as for you , ricky , your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van .
but , max
we are square .
yes , sir .
no . i will take a strega .
what , motherfucker ? you drinking the witch after dinner ?
yeah . that fernet tastes like tar . my grandfather tried to give me that .
some fuckin guineas he sent me . it is midnight and the motherfucker s ordering an apertif .
we do not know any drill . nobody told us anything .
what the fuck you think , i wanna hang with you motherfuckers ? yeah you are working . and put down the champagne .
she poured it for
what the fuck was you told ? do not talk , right ?
no . . .
four mimosas . you will love them . so here s the plan . i did not say shit to maxie , cause the man has acute angina , and i do not want to get him all worked up .
who s gonna outfit us ?
the red dragon .
shut it , man . shut it . tom is a square . he do not but dabble in shit . maxie had me hook up a loan back with him , through an austrian passbook account .

leggo . i got to wash it out .
sure , burn yourself , pain yourself , put all that poison into your hair , into your body trying to be white .
man , i do not want to hear all that .
the question is , who are you ? you are in the darkness , but it is not your fault . elijah muhammad can bring you into the light .
elijah who ?
what you sniffing around for ? i told you i gave you your last fix .
i ai not never seen a cat like you . ai not you scared talking like that in front of an ofay ?
that is he gonna do to me he ai not already done ?
you the only cat do not come on with that whatcha know , daddy jive and you do not cuss none .
i respect myself . a man cuss because he has not got the words to say that is on his mind .
tell you this you ai not no fool .
do not con me . do not try . . .
okay , okay .
do not con me .
what do you do with your time ?
i read . i study . because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself . respect his body and his mind . quit taking the white mangs poison into your body his cigarettes , his dope , his liquor , his white woman , his pork .
that is what mama used to say .
come on , daddy , pull my coat . what happens if you give all that up ? you get sick or something ? i pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft .
i am telling you god s words , not no hustle . i am talking the words of elijah , the black mangs god . i am telling you , boy , that god is black .
what ? everybody knows god is white .
but everything the white man taught you , you learned . he told you you were a black heathen and you believed him . he told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light . and you believed him . he taught you to worship a blond , blue eyed god with white skin and you believed him . he told you black was a curse , you believed him . did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary ?
what for ?
did you ever study anything was not part of some con ?
what the hell for , man ?
go on , fool the marble shooters are waiting for you .
i cannot make out that shit .
that is bullshit . that is a white mangs book . ai not all these white mangs books ?
they sure ai not no black mangs books in here .
then what you telling me to study in them for ?
you got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him . the truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words . it is buried there . you got to dig it out .
man , i am studying in the mangs book . i do not dig half the words .
look em up and and out what they mean .
where am i gonna start ?
aardvark , noun . an earth pig an ant eating african mammal . man , that sounds like the dozens .
ole pete ai not much in the head , but he can lay in there with the wood .
you pitch , baby i will ketch .
sure , white man throw us a bone and that is supposed to make us forget years .
a black man playing big league ball is something .
little .
i am not malcolm little and i am not satan .
allah has sent us a prophet , a black man named elijah muhammad . for if god is black , malcolm
then the devil is white .
i knew you would hear me . the white man is the devil . all white men are devils .
i sure met some .
the body is a holy repository .
i will not touch the white mangs poison his drugs , his liquor , his carrion , his women .
i will do it .
i cannot .
for evil to bend its knee , admit its guilt , implore his forgiveness , is the hardest thing on earth
i want to , bembry , but i cannot .
the hardest and the greatest .
i cannot .
for evil to bend its knee , admit its guilt , implore his forgiveness , is the hardest thing on earth
i want to , bembry , but i cannot .
the hardest and the greatest .
i do not know what to say to allah .
yeah . when i was picking a lock to rob somebody s house .
tell him that .
i do not know how .
you can grovel and crawl for sin , but not to save your soul . pick the lock , malcolm pick it .
brother bembry , can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street ?
now about our coming up in the world a little . you are not naive . you are a man of the world . the movement s grown we have grown with it . you know folks . they want their leaders to be prosperous . one hand washes the other .
i am telling you god s words , not to hustle .
what can i do for you ?
do you ?
not exactly , but i want to be one , like you .
we need more young warriors like yourself , stick around and we shall see if your heart is true .
i will have it tomorrow .
you are now benjamin x .
all praises are due to allah . thank you , brother minister .
is the program ready ?
no , brother minister .
folks are sitting out there today , not next week , expecting to hear our program .
next week , brother minister .
make it plain .
what ?
sure i will speak to your class . but i am a hard man on women . you want to know why ?
women talk too much . to tell a woman not to talk is like telling jesse james not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle . and samson , the strongest man that ever lived , was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms .
what points ?
considering today s standards of animal raising and curing meats , i do not fully understand the restriction on pork .
i see your point .
could we sit down someplace ?
i am sorry . i have had you on your feet for hours .
that is something i have not done in fifteen years .
what ?
sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda .
how do you like it ?
let s talk about you for a change .
there s nothing to talk about .
oh , yes , there is . i know a lot about you . brother bembry briefed me .
oh ? purely scientific interest i am sure .
you are from detroit , near where i come from . you majored in education at tuskegee . you are studying nursing and having trouble with your family .
i can handle it .
they want you to quit the muslims or they will not pay your tuition , is not that it ?
you have enough worries of your own .
no , good sisters are rare . we need every one . tell me something how tall are you ?
why do you ask ?
just an idle question .
but brother bembry says i am tall enough for a tall man .
how old are you , betty ?
there s a few things you do not know about women , brother malcolm . they are possessive and vain .
are you ?
and dogged when i set my mind to something .
what have you set your mind to ?
i am in detroit .
i know .
at a gas station . will you marry me ?
yes .
did you hear what i said ?
yes i did . did you hear my answer ?
i think so . can you catch a plane ?
yes . did you eat ?
it will not be easy .
just hold me .
it will be rough .
hush your mouth .
i will be away a lot .
i never told you , but when i first saw you on the podium , cleaning your glasses , i felt sorry for you . nobody as young as you should be that serious . but i do not think that anymore .
what do you think ?
why are you looking at me like that ?
because you are in trouble .
i do not want to bring my troubles home . you know that .
i am not made of glass .
i just want to sit here and be still .
we have never had a fight . not a real one . but we are going to have one right now if you do not talk about it .
talk about what ?
the talk is everywhere !
there s always talk , always been talk , and always will be talk . do not they say how i am trying to take over the nation , how i am getting rich off the nation ?
los angeles , upi elijah muhammad , year old leader of the black muslim movement , today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children . . .
there are always slanders , always lies . you are reading the devil s lies . cannot you see they are trying to bring us down , bring down the messenger .
both women , in their s , charged they had had intimacies with elijah muhammad since . . .
i was going to talk to bembry about it tonight .
to bembry ? is bembry your friend ?
no , that is the matter with you ? wake up ! are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself ? are you so committed you cannot face the truth ? bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established . ask him why your name has not been in muhammad speaks in over a year ? ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country , but not a single sentence in your own .
i am not interested in personal publicity . our people know what i am doing .
do you know what bembry is doing ? you are so blind , everyone can see this but you ! ! !
bembry saved my life . the honorable elijah muhammad saved my life .
a long time ago . you have repaid them many times over . ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture .
is that what this is about ? material wealth ?
what do we have , malcolm . a broken down jalopy and the clothes on our backs . we do not even own our own home . what about our children ? what about me ? you do not even own life insurance .
the nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me .
dear heart , you have to help me . i am raising our kids practically by myself , while you are running all over the world . you do not know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home ?
what do you want me to do ? our people need me .
we need you too !
what do you want me to do ?
get some sleep .
i am sorry . i have not been the best husband or father .
shhh !
families should not be separated . i will never make another long trip without you and the kids . we will all be together .
dear heart , i love you .
stop calling us . leave us alone . leave us alone . i will kill you . i will kill you .
malcolm , they keep calling , threatening us . i am going crazy , when is this going to stop ?
do not answer the phone . it is all right . it is all right . nothing is gonna happen to anybody .
dear heart , where are you ?
at the hilton . the girls asleep ?
i just put them to bed . can we come to the meeting tomorrow ?
i want to also , but until we are instructed by the messenger to do so , we will just wait and pray .
i am tired of praying .
i do not care about myself , my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds , they have nothing to do with this .
brother earl .
i am gonna try and get some work done tonight .
let some of us come down there .
no , that will not be necessary . i will be all right .
i wish you would listen to us . what about the meeting tomorrow ? we need to frisk people .
reverend chickenwing called last night and said he would not be able to attend .
so now we have no opening speaker ? why was not i informed last night ?
i called sister betty , she did not tell you ?
since when do you start telling sister betty my business ? since when ? she has nothing to do with this . you tell me , not her , not anybody else .
i assumed . . .
brother minister , what is wrong ?
the way i feel , i ought not to go out there today . in fact , i am going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself that is all a part of the white mangs big maneuver , to keep us fighting amongst ourselves , against each other . i am not fighting anyone , that is not what we are here for .
let s cancel .
is my family here yet ?
do you know what a friend you have in jesus , son ?
why do not you just ask your question ?
you have been talking about the disciples . what color were they ?
they were hebrew , were not they ?
that is right .
as jesus was . jesus was also a hebrew .
just what is your question ?
what color were the original hebrews ?
i told you we do not know for certain .
now just a moment , just a moment
but we do know that the people of that region of asia minor , from the tigris euphrates valley to the mediterranean , are dark skinned people . i have studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels . i have never seen a native of that area who was not black .
just what are you saying ?
mr . x is a demagogue . he has no place to go , so he exaggerates . he is a disservice to every good law abiding negro in the country . can i ask you a question ?
please , go ahead .
mr . malcolm x , why do you teach black supremacy ? why do you teach hate ?
stop me if i am wrong . i polarize the community . i erroneously appraise the racial picture .
you put it very well .
you left one phrase out . another educated kneegrew said to me and i quote brother malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the negro subculture . would you agree ?
entirely .
let him finish .
if you want to tell me .
if i surprise you , let me explain . menial work teaches us humility .
let me do it then .
no , each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing . allah has given you a great gift . use it wisely , never forgetting that we are nothing , while he is all .
did you see the papers today ?
yes , sir , i did .
can i ask you something ?
sure , man .
are you elijah s pimp ?
what ?
his greatest greatness .
say what you are saying .
i thought you said we were going to the movies last night .
i say a lot of things .
and like a fool i believe it .
you know that gal ?
mind your own goddamn business . . . she comes in a lot ?
about every other night , red .
she know ?
is she hooking ?
the average first offender gets two years for burglary . we were all first offenders . that is what sophia and peg drew
two years in the womengs reformatory at framingham .
but our crime was not burglary . it was balling white girls . they gave us the book .
fourteen counts of to years .
the sentences to run concurrently .
lo . i have got to freshen up .
i better not come in .
i ai not stupid .
i mean it is late , baby .
i know where you are going .
baby , i will call you tomorrow .
malcolm , you can be anything you want . you got class and you are smart .
all them books you read and you still do not know nuthin .
let s go .
why ? is it because of your white gal ? folks say you are running around town with her .
it is the same questions , mrs . little . since the death of your husband
murder .
there is a serious question as to whether
these are my children . mine . and they ai not no question . none .
i think sometimes , mrs . little , candor is the only kindness .
all of your children are delinquent , mrs . little , and one , at least , malcolm is a thief .
get out .
your control over your children , therefore
did you hear me ? !
you will regret this , mrs . little .
how many you turning out ?
.
make it . we got a lot of fishing to do .
thank you , brother sister , how are you ?
another one ?
how long has this been going on ?
all day since you and betty left . brother minister , i have to level with you . they gave me a mission . but i could not do it . i love y all .
what mission ?
to wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition . the ministers say you are spreading untruths about the messenger . the ministers say you are a great hypocrite , judas , benedict arnold . the ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the messenger s doorstep .
what does sidney say ?
i am with you , brother minister .
no . you will be marked for death .
let me die then .
i will not let myself come between you and your father . go home .
you are my father .
sheeet , you ai not . i had aplenty .
that is alright . baby , take your time . sophia s not going anywhere . i told you to walk , do not run .

bang , bang . you are dead .
i forgot to tell you i am wearing a bulletproof vest .
the hell you are .
i am tired of always playing the cops . i wanna be bogart sometimes .
you are too small to be bogart .
yeah and get a slave , too , huh , baby ?
i ai not doing bad .
jesus , red , she is just a kid .
that ai not bad .
do not never try to cross someone who ai not afraid to die .
what did you do , homey , palm it ?
palmed it right in the goddam chamber .
i got to hand it to you , homey . that is the best preacher hype i ever did hear .
it is not a hype , shorty . and i meant what i said join us .
come on , baby . i do not pay that shit no mind .
the honorable elijah muhammad says you should pay it all your mind . if you got a mind .
baby , i love you . take it easy , greasy . how about a snort ?
i have been clean for twelve years , shorty .
you is something , homeboy . my trouble is i ai not had enough stuff yet , i ai not et all the ribs i want and i sure ai not had enough white tail yet .
how is the rest of the gang ? you seen anyone ?
i am half wop , half nigger and ai not afraid of no one .
then i put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby . he gets his jollies off .
so what about him ?
so ? the man got silver , china , rugs
might be all right .
you want to be the head man ?
that is right .
head nigger in charge ?
i am the man .
your turn , rudy . you want me to flip for you ?
i am minister malcolm x . two witnesses saw him brought in . he was not brought out .
who the hell are they ?
brothers of brother johnson .
only a pig could do a thing like that .
watch your tongue , boy .
brother minister he often talked about you . he loves you , loves you like his own son . says you are the best , his greatest minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him .
he told you that ?
yes sir .
are you sure ?
yes , i am , brother minister . all i want is support for my children . he should provide for his children . that is all i want .
we were parceled out , all five of us . i went to this reform school and lived at this womangs house . she was in charge .
this is your room , malcolm . i know you will keep it clean .
this is malcolm , our new guest . we will treat him like a brother .
i was special . the only colored kid in class . i became a sort of mascot . like a pink poodle .
i did not know then that i was a nigger .
he is bright .
they talked about me like
good grades . fine athlete . president of his class .
what am i doing here ?
believe it or not , you are safe here . the judicial police will kill you . if they can . this page ?
you have a rather checkered past . mr . creasy . your interpol file is six pages long .
am i a suspect ?
show me mugshots of mexican policemen . maybe then we will get somewhere .
hombre en fuego . man on fire . that is what the papers have named you .
it is what you and rosanna named me . right ?
the last few days may represent the best police work of my life .
what do you want ?
the same thing as you . except , my reach is not as long as yours . my father was a policemen , did you know that ?
i do not know shit about you .
my family lives in miami . because of the death threats .
it is not worth it . be with them instead .
it galls me to watch you . you can do as much in days as i can in years . men like the the dreamer are protected . out of everyone s grasp it seems , but yours .
my country needs justice . proper justice . gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence . they need to be brought to trial . dealt with properly . then people will respect the law . when they see it works .
so you are going to talk me to death .
you walk out and deal justice . you are what i wish i could be . the policemen who kills you , his family will have all they want .
then i hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids . what do you want ?
i want to arrest you for murder ! i want to shake your hand and reload your gun ! i want to kill my pride and give you my blessing .
my deal is with rosanna . i knew you guys were up to something . are you two fucking ?
no , but i have to admit i thought about it .
liar . just tell me who the bank card belongs to . name and address .
you have no interest in making things easy , do you ?
creasy . . . i would have liked to have known you under different circumstances .
where are you coming from ?
south america .
where are you staying in mexico ?
i am on to juarez .
why ?
senor ?
a lot of people are looking for you .
i guess that makes you the smart one .
it is santa muerte . death worship . the religion of la hermanidad . there s a curse on you .
maybe i can help your situation and you mine .
so where do we begin ?
i need the name and address of the owner of a toyota corolla , license number me . . . we did not get the last digit so i need the ten possible matches .
so what do i get in return ?
i need something . do you have banking connections ?
where do i find you ?
what do you know about the cop ? tazinari . the one who made the ransom drop with samuel ramos ?
he is an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation . he is high on my hit list .
where does he live ?
he lives in a judicial compound . he travels by motorcade . he has better protection than george bush . even more importantly he is part of la hermanidad . his reach is far and wide .
another favor . . . get me banking info on jordan kalfus . u . s . deposits or withdrawals . thanks . oh , get me the same on samuel ramos .
how do i contact you ? we still do not have the atm info .
i traced the pin . i have an address for you . but i need to see you .
i show , you give me the information ?
deal .
reina rosas .
si .
we page him and he calls back on this cell phone .
what is his name ?
daniel .
daniel rosas sanchez .
what is his name ?
how does it work ?
who pays you ?
that is the pin number ?
the what ?
the number you use at the bank machine .
four seven four seven .
who killed her ? you ?
no !
do not lie to me .
the boss did or his brother .
who s the boss ?
what money ?
the ransom money . at the drop . he said tazinari , one of the policemen had taken it . he was crazy .
who s tazinari ?
she is late , mr . creasy .
yeah , i have got to get used to the routes . i it will not happen again .
no offense , but i am sorry that your profession needs to exist .
so am i , sister .
do you ever see the hand of god in what you do ?
not for a long time , sister .
the bible says , be not overcome of evil , but overcome evil with good .
drive .
do you know who i am ?
do you know who i am ?
who are you ?
the ramos kidnapping . how did it work ?
i do not know . we were just given instructions to take her .
i do not know ! we work in parts . a voice calls in a kidnapping . we deliver the target to the guardians . we do not even know them . they might transfer to other guardians . the negotiators and the bosses do not even see the target . they just make the deal !
who ordered it ?
the cops call him the dreamer .
where do i find him ?
i do not know , i swear .
i believe you .
i am professional . i just do my job .
me , too . tell me about the guardians .
he called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch .
who s he ?
who s he ?
i see him sometimes at the handball court in chapultepec on a saturday afternoon .
how do i recognize him .
he has a tattoo covering two thirds of his back . he is part of the brotherhood .
in the next hour , where do i find your partner ?
hello daniel . i have got your family and i want to negotiate .
mr . creasy . what do you want ?
how much do you want ?
it is non negotiable .
two million u . s . . . . three million u . s . ?
the most important thing in life is family . and there you are . you have my family . what do you want ?
i want you .
this is not possible . but in that house i have money . if i tell you where
yeah . yes .
listen ! i will give you a life for a life .
what do you mean ?
the girl s . pinta s .
you are a liar . pinta s dead .
do you know who i am ? i am the commandante of the judicial anti kidnapping division .
and one of the founding members of la hermanidad .
please , do not . . .
i do not know him . i saw the opportunity and got lucky .
lucky how ?
that he used policemen . that you killed them , it made it a police matter . the ramos family could not refuse our involvement .
and ?
and i had my men ready .
yes . many times .
o . k . so tell me more .
there was no ten million dollars .
the ransom was ten .
two and a half . that is how much there was .
do not lie to me !
maybe your men stole from you .
no . whoever took the rest took it before the exchange .
who gave the bags to ramos ?
that is all i know ! please . i am sorry for the girl . but it was business ! i am a professional .
were you provided with a gun ?
yes .
what is it ?
nine millimeter . a sig sauer .
is it loaded ?
your resume is impressive . nine years in the army . extensive counter terrorism work . i should not be able to afford you in my current state . that is the catch ?
i drink .
how does it affect you ?
my coordination . reaction time . if top professionals try to kidnap your daughter , the service will be on par with the pay .
and what if amateurs try it ?
i will probably kill them . is that likely ?
when did mexican customs start getting smart ?
creasy ? ? ? where the fuck are you ?
i am here .
what do you mean , i am here ?
you got a secondary search and you had a gun .
listen it was a calculated risk . i have done it a million times and never got caught .
everything happens once if you live long enough .
it does not make sense to x ray your bags coming off the plane .
so that is wrong ?
nothing wrong .
so how is business ?
japanese are here in a big way . cheap labor . factory space . but they feel a lot safer living over the border in el paso . i ferry em back and forth . they think i am john fucking wayne .
but do not you stay in el paso ?
yeah , right . . .
oh , like you have not been in worse places .
you been working ?
not for eight months . i was in columbia looking around , but , nothing seemed interesting .
how long you staying , crease ?
you did something on impulse ?
your spanish is good enough . you certainly look the part .
you are crazy . people would hire a has been , ray ? a drunk ?
well , you would have to keep it under control .
and what if , just say , there was a kidnap attempt ?
it is not exactly a scam , crease . even at half speed you are pretty damn good .
a bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time . willing to talk . i am not good at that .
what are you doing here ?
i came to visit you .
bullshit . i have known you fifteen years . you do not visit .
a bodyguard . . . who s the guy ?
samuel ramos . owns one of the plants in juarez . the jap car industry is in the toilet . he is trying to persuade ford to partner with him . i think he is in trouble . he asked me if i knew anyone he could trust .
oh , now you think i can be trusted .
there s still ink on my fingers from last week .
you mean a misfire ?
i mean nothing . the hammer came down and nothing happened . dimple on the primer .
i have heard of it . never happened to me though . maybe the firing pings off .
creasy ?
then one day , he calls and says , i am in love and i am moving to mexico . i said what happened to the plan ?
you got three of the fuckers . all dead .
pinta . . .
stomach s gone . but . . . okay .
fuck . look at you you will not last a day the shape you are in . unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed .
yes or no ?
i will take the . and the webley . .
cut the stock here . the barrel here . make sure you file it smooth . rocket launchers ?
do you like dogs , mr . creasy ?
if they like me .
frank does not take to most people . do you speak german ?
ein klines bisschen . a tiny bit .
that is bird . emilio forgot to take him with when he left .
who s emilio ?
in between you can take mom shopping and to lunch . does that sound alright , mr . creasy ?
creasy . just call me creasy .
where are you from , creasy ?
the united states .
no .
you can drive and talk at the same time , cannot you ?
no .
why not ?
potential ? i do not understand .
places where the road bends , places away from buildings , places where the traffic thins out . but you do not have to understand . i do . so no talking .
are you going to quit ? my last bodyguard quit .
let me guess , you would not stop talking ?
someone gave him more money than we could .
i am a bargain .
being black , is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in mexico ?
time will tell .
there were kidnappings in mexico city in the last six days . four a day . what do you think about that , mr . creasy ?
we are taking a different way home .
did you like school , creasy ?
no .
not at all ?
no .
hmmm ?
it was not a school like yours and there was no sister anna .
so you were unhappy ?
being unhappy is a state of mind . i never thought about it .
and do not start crying .
pinta , do you have a pencil ?
you are fast .
what are you doing ?
calling for emilio s macaw . i thought i heard him .
do you think he will come back ?
maybe . did you hear him ?
no .
how do you think he got out ?
well , i let him go .
it is better to be free , right ?
they will be back in a week .
it hurts .
where ?
i do not think they are broken . anywhere else ?
the night you arrived , mom asked you if you had a family and you lied , did not you ?
do you always sleep with him ?
i am too old for him . do not tell my friends .
did you sleep alright ?
yes .
how is the ankle ? can you put your weight on it ?
it is not too bad . will it take a long time before it is better ? our big swim meet is in three weeks . interschools . i was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle .
does not matter . i always finish second .
why do you ask ?
well , it is a sort of wife .
but the emperor of china had of them ! how can that be ?
in the west , it is one wife for one husband , but different cultures have different rules .
it must be difficult having lots of wives .
you feel sorry for the husband ?
so how come you know so much about those countries ?
i had to do my homework on them when i worked there . also i enjoy history .
what did you do in asia ? is that where you met the man with cigarettes ?
you do not flinch when a gun goes off you react . you go . do not listen for the sound do not anticipate it . concentrate on the sound itself .
i do not understand .
remember you asked me what state i was from ?
yes .
where you are from is not so much about geography it is about events . where you are from is what happened to you .
good things happen , too , creasy . like meeting me .
do you have a girlfriend , creasy ?
no .
did you used to ?
you are late .
i am sorry .
where is my mother ?
i dropped her at home .
i am not afraid you , creasy .
i know you are not .
the gunshot holds no fear . say it .
the gunshot holds no fear .
i am tough , creasy . i am tough as you .
that is so important in los angeles ?
your father has business .
the blocks .
could i ask you a question ?
could i stop you ?
you do not drink like you used to .
that is not a question .
i know because i go in your room and check the bottles .
still not a question .
my mom drinks , too . . . why do people drink , creasy ?
now that is a question . i do not know about your mom . for me , the problem is not in the glass . the problem s in between my ears .
you think too much ?
pinta , we have got to go . travel sucks at this time .
that is strange . frank was a no show . not like him to miss a ride .
you should break all my fingers , creasy , then tape them back together . i will not be able to play the piano , but i could still swim .
do not be a baby . you are tougher than that .
there s no such thing as tough , creasy . just trained and untrained .
then be trained .
i am going to keep people safe someday . just like you .
be a swimmer .
continue to play in the wrong key , like you are dyslexic .
dyslexic ?
like st . jude . a hopeless case that has a complete block about c minor . but remember , whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves . new testament , romans .
you got that right .
the world of our children . how dare they ?
it is war . the weakest suffer the most .
you are american .
you have done much of this work before ?
mr . creasy , i wanted to make sure you have everything you need .
i am fine .
is the food alright ? maria tells me that you did not eat .
the food s fine . sometimes i do not eat .
how are you getting along with pinta ?
we will be okay once she realizes i am not a new toy .
yes , she told me . do you have children , mr . creasy ?
no .
you should know they are tenacious when they want something . and pinta wants to be friends .
look . maybe this is not going to work . maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone . . . more sociable .
it makes it all seem so serious .
it is serious , mrs . ramos .
sorry .
jordan !
why are you here ? why did not you die ?
they planned it , samuel and kalfus .
planned what ?
i do not believe you .
i want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between reforma and the freeway junction . in minutes .
you are lying . i do not believe you .
creasy . . . wait .
rosanna guerrero .
it is creasy .
where are you ?
los arcos . was a little girl kidnapped recently ? about twelve maybe ?
last night . do you know something ?
what was her name ?
the family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later . his father still has not gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass .
and now every mother with money in mexico city wants bigger and better bodyguards . my own wife included .
if she pisses you off , you get another one .
of course i care about pinta . she will be as beautiful as her mother one day .
all my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance .
i have a policy , aig . it covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days , without a bodyguard , i will not be able to renew it .
i know you need to please lisa . an ass like that is hard to find . good bodyguards are even harder .
you need a bodyguard of some description . it is a dangerous world we live in . but you will get what you pay for . he does not need to be superman , does he ? can you go fifteen grand ?
for a year ?
and lisa will be able to save face . we will not be the only family without a bodyguard .
her beauty fucks with your mind .
for an american she understands this country very well .
you have the money .
yes .
ok , repeat the drop instructions .
the money , million u . s . will be divided into two gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the k r agent . then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car .
i need a driver to drive samuel , the father .
no . why ?
he has a heart condition . angina . he responds badly to stress .
you should be sleeping , baby .
good news . you are going back to school .
when ?
could he speak english ? emilio could not speak english .
yes , mom ?
i like him , mom .
you do ?
i think he is been sick . he is alright now , but i think he is been very , very sick .
bye , mom .
i will call you from detroit , baby .
a mangs worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes . only the amount matters .
and bankruptcy . where will that put me in the social strata ?
i am only asking for one thing . and it is not an extravagance . it is not even for me it is for our daughter .
our child s safety is at stake .
these people are professionals . they do not waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt .
my wife , mr . creasy .
he has experience in related work . a great deal of it .
i think it is nice he is american .
i think it is fantastic .
she likes him .
hmm ?
creasy . pinta likes him .
he has to go , samuel .
what ? who ?
creasy .
why ? you were so pleased with him .
pinta likes him too much . she thinks of him as a father .
that is ridiculous .
i have just been so busy , lisa .
it will be a hard break .
she is young . she will get over it .
a bodyguard was shot trying to protect a year old . the bodyguard s american . not only that he is black .
is that good or bad ?
he will die of his wounds bleed to death before he can do anything .
because he is outside . because he is not tied to the same system we are .
i know this . your point ?
then what do you have to lose ?
is it true ? creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday .
when you talked to him , did he look sane ?
no . not by the rules of polite society at least .
you only fuck me to get information .
you only give information so you can fuck me .
and as long as we are talking information , there s something else as well .
who s that ?
he is not a cop killer .
i am sure he is not . though he is certainly adept at killing .
he was doing his job , protecting the girl . if police were involved , you figure it out . i am here for him .
pollo pibil . chicken and chorizo sausage . hmmmh . they marinate it in lemon and orange juice . it is a stew really .
tell me about your friend creasy .
you just said it . he is my friend . nothing else to say .
i read the file . you and creasy have been seen quite a bit together .
two tourists who never went home .
you helped him get this job .
that is what friends do .
yes . but if i traced creasy to you , others will do it as well . their facilities are as good as my own , if not better .
i can take care of myself .
you and creasy both . a two man army according to interpol . panama . lebanon with the druze . desert storm . where you were contracted by the u . s . army to hunt down elite iraqi military commanders . you two were a married couple .
the kind that gets divorced , but still stay friends .
none of your business . or mine for that matter . i got nothing more to say .
this is my jurisdiction . i want these men as much as creasy does .
he will deliver more justice in a weekend , than ten years of your courts and tribunals . so stay out of his way .
i plan to . i will even help him if i can . he is going to lead me to the the dreamer . someone i want very badly . but i would like to understand him . give me that .
pinta martin ramos is just a number to you . tragic , a public outcry , but a number . one more dead .
what was she to creasy then ?
light . at the end of a long , dark tunnel . somehow , she showed him it was alright to live again .
and they took that away .
i told you she was not especially attractive , but that she had a good deal of charm , and she is really a real nice girl . . .
she is all right , andy . it is just that i get one saturday night off every three weeks , and i was expecting something better , that is all .
i told you she was not attractive . . .
you told me that she was a little tall , but that she was not bad looking at all .
millie s been after me to fix her up with a date , so i . . .
hey , herbie . . .
what ?
you wanna have a drink before we start dancing ?
so waddaya feel like doing tonight ?
i do not know , ang . wadda you feel like doing ?

oh , catherine , please ! do not make a tragedy . you come to my house where you know you be happier yourself .
it pains that they should do this .
catherine , you are very dear to me . we have cried many times together . when my husband died , i would have gone insane if it were not for you . i ask you to come to my house , because i can make you happy . please come to my house .
these are the worst years . i tell you . it is gonna happen to you . i am afraida look inna mirror . i am afraid i am gonna see an old lady with white hair , like the old ladies inna park , little bundles inna black shawl , waiting for the coffin . i am fifty six years old . what am i to do with myself ? i have strength in my hands . i wanna cook . i wanna clean . i wanna make dinner for my children . am i an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close ? these are the terrible years , theresa ! terrible years !
hey , i come home from your house last night , marty was here with a girl .
who ?
marty .
your son marty ?
well , what marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl ?
were the lights on ?
oh sure . this girl is a college graduate .
they are the worst . college girls are one step from the streets . they smoke like men inna saloon . my son joseph , his wife , you know , she types onna typewriter . one step from the streets , i tell you . mrs . pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment .
well , that is all . you will see . today , tomorrow , inna week , he is gonna say to you , hey , ma , it is no good being a single man . i am tired a running around . then he is gonna say , hey , ma , wadda we need this old house ? why do not we sell this old house , move into a nicer parta town ? a nice little apartment ?
i do not sell this house , i tell you that . this is my husband s house . i had six children in this house .
you will see . a coupla months , you gonna be an old lady , sleeping onna couch in her daughter in law s house .
you come up here often ?
i was up here twice before . once with a friend of mine and once i came up alone . the last time . . . do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there ?
yeah .
well , the last time i was up here , that is where i sat . i sat there for an hour and a half , without moving a muscle . now and then , some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind . i will never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap . then i began to cry , and i had to get up and go home .
i cry a lot too . i am a big cryer .
this is something recent with me , this bursting into tears at the least thing .
oh , i cry all the time , any little thing . my brothers , my brother in laws , they are always telling me what a goodhearted guy i am . well , you do not get goodhearted by accident . you get kicked around long enough , you get to be a real professor of pain . i know exactly how you feel . and i also want you to know i am having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself . so you see , you are not such a dog as you think you are .
i am having a very good time , too .
so there you are . so i guess i am not such a dog as i think i am .
you are a very nice guy , and i do not know why some girl has not grabbed you off long ago .
i am twenty nine years old . how old are you ?
. . . you teach chemistry ? that is funny . where ? what school ?
benjamin franklin high school .
you gotta real nice face , you know ? it is really a nice face .
. . . when i got outta the army , clara , i was lost . i did not know what i wanted to do . i was twenny five years old , what was i gonna do , go back to my old job , forty cents an hour . i thought maybe i go to college under the g . i . biller rights , you know ? but i would not graduate till i was twenny eight , twenny nine years old , even if i made it in three years . and my brother freddie wanted to get married , and i had three unmarried sisters in an italian home , that is a terrible thing . and my kid brother nickie , he is a one got married last week . so i just went to pieces . i used to walk inna streets till three , four o clock inna mornings . my mother used to be so worried about me . my uncle mario come over one time . he offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift . he got his own cab , you know . and god forgive me for what i am gonna say now , but i used to thinka doing away with myself . i used to stand sometimes in the subway , and god forgive me what i am going to say , i used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels .
yes , i know .
i am a catholic , you know , and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin .
yes , i know .
so then mr . gazzara he was a frienda my father he offered me this job in his butcher shop , and everybody pleaded with me to take it . so that is what happened . i did not wanna be a butcher .
there s nothing wrong with being a butcher .
well , i would not call it an elegant profession . it is in a lower social scale . people look down on butchers .
well , the point is mr . gazzara wantsa sell his shop now , because he and his wife are lonely , and they wanna move out to california in los angeles and live near their married daughter . because she is always writing them to come out there . so it is a nice little shop . i handle his books for him , so i know he has a thirty five percent markup which is not unreasonable , and he takes home net maybe a hundred , hundred and fifty bucks a week . the point is , of course , you gotta worry about the supermarkets . there s two inna neighborhood now , and there s an a p coming in , at least that is the rumor . of course , mosta his trade is strictly italian , but the younger italian girls , they get married , and they do not stick to the old italian dishes so much . i mean , you gotta take that into account too .
it is my feeling that you really want to buy this shop , marty .
wadda you think ?
i only got about three bucks on me now , but i just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of webster avenue . why do not we walk back to my house ? i will run in , pick up some dough , and let s step out somewhere .
it is only a quarter of twelve . the clock s right over there .
. . . it is really a fine opportunity for me . but i am not sure i want to be a department head . it is mostly executive and administrative work . well , anyway , i told you about my father , and he depends on me a great deal , and . . .
why do not you just move out to portchester ?
i think you are kidding yourself , clara . i used to think about moving out , you know ? and that is what i used to say . my mother needs me . but when you really get down to it , that ai not it at all . actually , you need your father . you know what i mean ? you are living at home , and you got your father and mother there , and you can go on like that being a little girl all your life .
i am afraid of being lonely .
oh , you will not be so lonely . you will make friends right away .
actually , i do not make friends easily .
this is the kitchen .
yes , i know .
siddown , take off your coat . you want something to eat ? we gotta whole half chicken in the icebox .
no , thank you . i do not think i should stay very long .
so i was telling you , my kid brother nickie got married last sunday . that was a very nice affair . and they had this statue of some woman , and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth . i never saw anything so grand in my life . and watta meal . i am a butcher , so i know a good hunka steak when i see one . that was choice filet , right off the toppa the chuck . a buck eighty a pound . of course , if you wanna cheaper cut , get rib steak . that gotta lotta waste on it , but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound , if it is trimmed . listen , clara , make yourself comfortable . you are all tense .
oh , i am fine .
you want me to take you home , i will take you home .
no , marty , please . . .
i like you . i like you . i been telling you all night , i like you . . .
marty . . .
no . . .
please . . .
no . . .
please . . .
waddaya doing tomorrow night ?
nothing .
i will call you up tomorrow morning . maybe , we will go see a movie .
i would like that very much .
the reason i cannot be definite about it now is my aunt catherine is probably coming over tomorrow , and i may have to help out .
i will wait for your call .
we better get started to your house , because the buses only run about one an hour now .
waddaya doing new year s eve ?
what happened , angie , was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk , and then we thought we were gonna come right back , but we got to talking . listen , angie , i want you to meet clara . . . clara , this is my best friend , angie . i told you about him .
you got an elevator in this house ?
we just live one flight up .
so i will call you tomorrow .
okay , so i will see you tomorrow night then .
siddown , siddown . you want some chicken ? we got some chicken in the ice box .
no , mrs . pilletti . we were just going home . thank you very much anyway .
no , thank you , really , mrs . pilletti .
it is a very sad business , i tell you . a woman , fifty six years old , all her life , she had her own home . now she is just an old lady , sleeping on her daughter in law s couch . it is a curse to be a mother , i tell you . your children grow up and then what is left for you to do ? what is a mother s life but her children ? it is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home .
could not she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time ?
hobby ! what can she do ? she cooks and she cleans . you gotta have a house to clean . you gotta have children to cook for . these are the terrible years for a woman , the terrible years .
you do not think my sister catherine should live in her daughter in law s house ?
well , i do not know the people , of course , but as a rule , i do not think a mother in law should live with a young couple .
where do you think a mother in law should go ?
i do not think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life .
well , maybe that is what they teach you in new york university . in real life , it do not work out that way . you wait till you are a mother .
it was very nice meeting you , mrs . pilletti . i hope i will see you again .
goodnight , mrs . pilletti .
you say something ?
yeah . i was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl .
i am stag .
well , i will tell you . i got stuck on a blind date with a dog , and i just met an old girl i used to know , and i was wondering how i am gonna get rid of the girl i am with . somebody to take her home , you know what i mean ? i would be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me .
what ?
i will take you over , and i will introduce you as an old army buddy of mine , and then i will cut out . because i got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck , and i will pay you five bucks .
are you kidding ?
no , i am not kidding .
herbie ! wadda you doing here ? !
i came up to dance , wadda you think ? you here with somebody ?
i am just here with another girl .
where you going now ?
i am just gonna get my cigarettes . i left them in my coat .
i will see you around .
she was always a bit thin in the hips . . .
and that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow , is not he ?
oh , that is nice . so the doctor was wrong , was not he ?
oh , no ! she died right in the hospital . . .
oh , that is a sad story . and her husband is that little fellow , works in peter reeves .
that is the one .
. . . so the whole book winds up , mike hammer , he is inna room there with this doll . so he says , you rat , you are the murderer . so she begins to con him , you know ? she tells him how she loves him . and then bam ! he shoots her in the stomach . so she is laying there , gasping for breath , and she says , how could you do that ? and he says , it was easy .
what i like about mickey spillane is he knows how to handle women . in one book , he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car , and she throws a pass at him . and then he meets two beautiful twins , and they throw passes at him . and then he meets some beautiful society leader , and she throws a pass at him , and . . .
i always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who s twenny years younger than he is so that when he is forty , his wife is a real nice looking doll .
that means he would have to marry the girl when she was one year old .
what time is it ?
tommy , before you go , i wonder if you gimme a little advice .
sure , what ?
all right , i will see you , thomas , because he wants an answer by monday .
sure . thanks a lot about my mother . we will work out some arrangement , because naturally i want to pay . . .
do not worry about it .
boy , beautiful day , hey , thomas ?
tommy , gimme a coupla minutes , because i promised mr . gazzara i would let him know tomorrow . see , what i wanna know , tom , if a buncha individual retail merchants get together , how does it operate ? on individual mark ups ? you know what i mean ? say i am the butcher and aldo capelli , he is the dairyman and grocer , so suppose i mark up thirty five percent , but he works on forty , so . . .
waddaya talking about , do you know what you are talking about ?
wadda you wanna buy a shop for , will you tell me ? you gotta good job , you got no wife , you got no responsibilities . boy , i wish i was you , boy . waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop ? that is he want ? five thousand down ? you are gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty , seventy bucks a month . a mortgage anna note from the bank . for pete s sake , you are a single man with no responsibilities . stay that way , boy . take my advice .
well , you see , thomas i figure the big problem is the supermarkets . but patsy s shop , that is a specialized trade . the supermarkets do not carry italian meat .
well , i understand the problem about the supermarkets , but i was talking to this girl last night , and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset .
marty , see that my mother is nice and comfortable , eh ?
sure . this girl said . . .
hello , marty , when you coming home ? where you now ? because your cousin thomas and his wife virginia , they are here . they had another fight with your aunt catherine . . . i do not know . . .
hello , ma .
marty , thomas and virginia are here . they had another fight with your aunt catherine . so they ask me , would it be all right if catherine come to live with us . so i said , all right with me , but we have to ask you . marty , she is a lonely old lady . nobody wants her . everybody s throwing her outta their house . . .

ma , when are you gonna give up ? you gotta bachelor on your hands . i ai not never gonna get married .
you gonna get married .
sooner or later , there comes a point in a mangs life when he gotta face some facts , and one fact i gotta face is that whatever it is that women like , i ai not got it . i chased enough girls in my life . i went to enough dances . i got hurt enough . i do not wanna get hurt no more . i just called a girl just now , and i got a real brush off , boy . i figured i was past the point of being hurt , but that hurt . some stupid woman who i did not even wanna call up . she gave me the brush . i do not wanna go to the stardust ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like i was a bug . i got feelings , you know . i had enough pain . no , thank you .

he says okay , it is all right catherine comes here .
i just wanna thank you people again , because the situation was just becoming impossible .
hello , aunt theresa .

ma , you want something to eat , some tuna fish ?
hello , aunt theresa .
hello , thomas , how do you feel ?
he coming home right now .
so what happened , aunt theresa , about the milk bottle was my mother in law , she comes inna kitchen , aunt theresa , and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there , so then she begins telling me how i waste money and how i cannot cook , and how i am raising my baby all wrong , so she got me so nervous , i spilled some milk i was making for the baby . . .
she was here , you know , wednesday , and i said , catherine , my sister . . .
so she say , you are spilling the milk . so she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk i spilled , so she got me so mad , so i said , mama , you wanna see me really spill some milk ? so i took the bottle , and i threw it against the door . i did not throw it at her . that is just something she made up . she goes around telling everybody i threw the bottla milk at her . i did not throw it anywheres near her . well , i was sorry right away , you know , but she ran outta the house .
sure .
aunt theresa , you got this big house here . i mean , you got this big house just for you and marty . and i thought maybe tommy s mother could come here and live with you and marty .
well . . .
because i called up tommy s brother joe , and i said , joe , she is driving me crazy . why do not you take her for a couple of years ? and he said , oh no ! i know i sound like a terrible woman . . .
no , virginia , i know how you feel .
i am sorry we gotta rush like this . . .
that is all right , that is all right . . .
on accounta . . .
we did not tell her anything yet . we thought that we would leave it to you . we thought you would put it like how you were lonely , and why do not she come to live with you . because that way it looks like she is doing you a favor , insteada we are throwing her out , and it will not be so cruel on her . do you want tommy and me to stay here with you ?
listen , let s go downa kaplans apartment . they told us to come down .
well , i will tell you , aunt theresa . . .
lemme tell it , tommy .
okay .
that is very nice a you , aunt theresa .
marty , i do not know how to tell you how much i appreciate what you and your mother are doing , because the kinda thing was happening in our house was virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby . so my mother comes in . . .
tommy !
do not you think i feel lousy about this too ?
all right , ginnie . i do not wanna talk anymore about it . i do not think i got one hour s sleep the whole night . last night was the first time in my life i ever heard my mother cry , you know that ?
tommy . . .
i know what you are gonna say . a mangs gotta stop being his mother s baby sooner or later . how many times you gonna say it ? she is my mother , you know . i oughta have some feelings about her , do not you think ?
why do you always put me inna position of being the louse ?
tommy . . .
wadda you so sore about ?
what about the time she wanted to make an old fashioned italian dinner for my brother , but you would not let her ! ?
waddaya talking about ? ! !
once a month you could not let her use the kitchen !
i told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted . . .
. . . you hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time !
there s sort of a built in prayer for the sick man to get well , but of course that is not the basic intention .
we wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes .
how they going , losing preacher ? what do you hear from the pope ?
you talked to walt ?
what do you want me to do ?
put in one of your fixes . walt knows he is loused himself with the church , but it is part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom . which he will think if you grease the skids for him .
i do not think i can give absolution to a man who s about to commit suicide . it is a mortal sin .
what is , red , the intention or the act ?
i believe it takes both . i would have to look it up .
nice looking kid . going to be okay ?
what do i do with it hawk ? this is a little out of my line .
y all were short a couple cutters and we are what the army sent .
do not you know the first thing you are supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders ?
reckon so , but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite .
you are welcome to one of these , whatever they are .
good . you have both been working close to the front .
